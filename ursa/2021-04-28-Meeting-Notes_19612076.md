# Hyperledger Ursa (EOL) : 2021-04-28 Meeting Notes

Created by Hart Montgomery, last modified on Apr 28, 2021

1. Welcome/greetings–we should send links to the agenda.
2. Discussion of Ursa audit.
   
   1. Backdoors are a concern of a practitioner.
   2. Whether to use auditors or cryptographers for an audit (we obviously think cryptographers, but that's coming from cryptographers).
   3. Long discussion, but good to hear from practictioners.
3. Oberon:  Mike's (cool) new crate.
