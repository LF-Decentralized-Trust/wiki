# Hyperledger Ursa (EOL) : 2021-02-17 Meeting Notes

Created by Hart Montgomery, last modified on Feb 17, 2021

1. Ad hoc items:  not too much to discuss.
2. Adherence to Hyperledger infrastructure:  we should keep track of this and make sure we follow the rules once they are clear.
3. What sort of signatures do we need?
4. Goal:  find out who is using what.  We could have some sort of table.
