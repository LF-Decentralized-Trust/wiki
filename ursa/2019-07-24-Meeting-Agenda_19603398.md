# Hyperledger Ursa (EOL) : 2019-07-24 Meeting Agenda

Created by Hart Montgomery, last modified by Jon Geater on Jul 24, 2019

1. Open PR discussion
   
   1. [RFC for CS verifiable encryption](https://github.com/hyperledger/ursa-rfcs/pull/9)
2. Update from Jon and Rebecca on PKCS#11 interface spec.
3. Interfaces in Ursa for password hashing, AEAD, Boxes (libsodium), HMAC. indy-sdk has some [implementations](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/tree/master/libindy/src/utils/crypto) (Argon, chacha20poly1305, etc) of these interfaces. Some of that code could be moved in Ursa.
4. Jon has been asked to do a lightning talk on Ursa at the meet up on Wednesday. Â Would be nice to review the slides and messaging with the whole group.
