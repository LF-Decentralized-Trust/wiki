# Hyperledger Ursa (EOL) : 2022-01-05 Meeting Notes

Created by Hart Montgomery, last modified on Jan 05, 2022

1. R1CS pull request:  explanation and notes.
2. Time crate issue:  we should really be using Dalek.
3. Chat:  no one likes rocketchat, we should use Discord or some other platform.
4. Future:  Resources coming in, but people less interested in more functionality and more interested in hardening the library.
