# Hyperledger Ursa (EOL) : 2020-09-30 Meeting Notes

Created by Hart Montgomery, last modified on Sep 30, 2020

1. Welcome to everyone–we had some new faces.
2. CII badge stuff:  we went through the CII badging guidelines.
   
   1. We are still in compliance, with possible exceptions related to dynamic analysis.
3. Discussion of refactoring parts of Ursa:
   
   1. Not changing external APIs
   2. Move everything around to one library.
   3. Group schemes by protocol (i.e. encryption, signatures, etc.)
   4. Everyone seemed to agree, and it fit with the RFC.
