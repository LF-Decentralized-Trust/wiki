# Hyperledger Ursa (EOL) : 2020-09-16 Meeting Agenda

Created by Hart Montgomery, last modified on Sep 15, 2020

1. Member Summit summary.
2. Post-quantum wrap-up (we've been discussing this for a while–it would be good to figure out something and decide what we think is a good path forward).
3. Discussion on "base crypto" library–Cactus (and maybe others) want to use.
4. Open PRs and discussion.
