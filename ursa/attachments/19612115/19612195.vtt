00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:29.340
Nathan George: Hello.

2
00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.130
Nathan George: Were you at the area's me before this.

3
00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:35.520
Cam Parra | kiva.org: yeah I was only there for like half of it, though.

4
00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.440
Nathan George: I didn't go to that call, so I don't know if it's over yet or or what.

5
00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.120
Cam Parra | kiva.org: I didn't try to pull people in from that call um.

6
00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.170
Cam Parra | kiva.org: yeah just seeing that.

7
00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:59.610
Cam Parra | kiva.org: we're just we have like a lot of stuff on the plate right now so i've been like toning down my my recruitment right now.

8
00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.820
Nathan George: make sense there's a bunch of stuff that kind of just has to get done for can build more momentum.

9
00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:07.110
Right.

10
00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:20.490
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Well, unexpected stuff is that what the plan was to build momentum and then move forward with refactoring but yeah it all this stuff just came flying out of straight out of nowhere.

11
00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.060
Cam Parra | kiva.org: He hurt hey.

12
00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.810
Hart Montgomery: how's it going.

13
00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:27.030
Cam Parra | kiva.org: it's going well.

14
00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:29.700
Hart Montgomery: Excellent.

15
00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.170
Hart Montgomery: you're here I hope all my emails made sense.

16
00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:52.830
Cam Parra | kiva.org: yeah yeah the only I guess the only question that I have is so so I, I know that I got the authors of the of the paper, but how did this How did the that that want to really get reported to us like do we have any history of that or.

17
00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.330
Hart Montgomery: No, they reached out to Mike and I.

18
00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.450
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Okay, and they're part of the aroma project or you.

19
00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.060
Hart Montgomery: know not officially.

20
00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:02.400
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Okay.

21
00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:10.530
Hart Montgomery: That we talked to one of them, I think it was Peter, and he was just like a random physics Grad student who was doing like contracting work.

22
00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:12.720
Hart Montgomery: super nice guy.

23
00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:19.560
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Because the other, the other person mentioned their website states that they're like the lead developer of the aroma project.

24
00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.330
Hart Montgomery: yeah so.

25
00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.970
Hart Montgomery: I think, Peter was contract was a contractor for irma.

26
00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.180
Hart Montgomery: uh huh so I only deal with one of those guys.

27
00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:37.050
Cam Parra | kiva.org: yeah it's see it says is, though, is the lead architect.

28
00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:39.810
Cam Parra | kiva.org: At the irma project.

29
00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:41.700
Hart Montgomery: yeah.

30
00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.970
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Okay, so so David is just a researcher.

31
00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.590
Hart Montgomery: Well, he was like a physics class I was David not yeah he was like a physics Grad student.

32
00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:07.230
Hart Montgomery: So he was like a physics Grad student who was like doing some blockchain work for subtle body in Grad school.

33
00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.970
Hart Montgomery: here.

34
00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:24.150
Cam Parra | kiva.org: yeah that's that's it yeah I tried looking him up and I was weirded out because it was like a different department, but he was listed under his his like academic work and I was like wait.

35
00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:26.880
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Are we getting pumped here or whatever.

36
00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.740
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Like because it was yeah it was like something like physics, or something like that.

37
00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:43.230
Nathan George: i've had good experiences with physicists that become computer programmers i'm not sure why, but you know they have a good head for the algorithms in the math that's for sure.

38
00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.050
Hart Montgomery: yeah they have they also like.

39
00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:58.740
Hart Montgomery: They also typically do very well like hedge fund jobs or five years they have you know good quantitative reasoning skills and like there aren't a lot of jobs in physics.

40
00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:00.360
So.

41
00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.240
Cam Parra | kiva.org: yeah physics, was one of those classes, that I struggled with in college.

42
00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.040
Cam Parra | kiva.org: it's like a whole different way of thinking.

43
00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:23.790
Cam Parra | kiva.org: yeah anyways so um so yeah so they were the only three that are going to attend, I was hoping that that.

44
00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:29.340
Cam Parra | kiva.org: brand would join us i've slowed kind of them a momentum down.

45
00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:38.850
Cam Parra | kiva.org: of our calls because of what's going on with us fixing the vulnerabilities that have been reported to us.

46
00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:44.010
Cam Parra | kiva.org: And so I haven't been recruiting as much because we kind of just need to get this done.

47
00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:45.990
Hart Montgomery: don't where we started understand.

48
00:04:46.980 --> 00:05:05.400
Cam Parra | kiva.org: yeah if we we started like restructuring and all that, so there is good news is that we have we have started the report, like I like you've seen it we've actually made a lot of edits to it, like the team at kiva and are close to close to having it ready to be shareable.

49
00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:06.180
Great.

50
00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:11.730
Cam Parra | kiva.org: And yeah just outlining everything there it's.

51
00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:24.240
Cam Parra | kiva.org: It is kind of difficult trying to summarize all of these like solutions like hundreds of pages of solutions into one report but but yeah we're managing um.

52
00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:37.620
Cam Parra | kiva.org: I guess like the The thing that I want to know is, are you familiar with you're familiar with young commanded dishes paper about proving that and is a product of safe PRIMES in zero knowledge right.

53
00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:39.570
Hart Montgomery: vaguely yes.

54
00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:48.120
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Okay, do you know what how the flow works like I guess my biggest question is like so um.

55
00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:56.340
Cam Parra | kiva.org: So we we basically have to, we want to, we want to make sure that the issuer have is able to.

56
00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:00.360
Cam Parra | kiva.org: The issuer is using safe PRIMES right.

57
00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:10.290
Cam Parra | kiva.org: And they have to prove to verify that you know that their P amp Q are safe PRIMES and.

58
00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:20.100
Cam Parra | kiva.org: I have to do that in zero knowledge right, and so this is this verify or the holder or or is it a separate entity that would be the verified here.

59
00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:28.470
Hart Montgomery: yeah so it would be the holder right to the older is a really it will be anyone interacting with the issuer right.

60
00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:32.610
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Right.

61
00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:37.470
Hart Montgomery: So I mean you could have a model where like you know.

62
00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:46.830
Hart Montgomery: Like you know if enough people the holder trusts verify the issuer's credentials right.

63
00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:47.880
Cam Parra | kiva.org: mm hmm.

64
00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:50.550
Hart Montgomery: Then, that would probably be acceptable to.

65
00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:58.380
Hart Montgomery: like, if I were putting this together and practice I would do a very lazy solution.

66
00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:01.980
Hart Montgomery: Where I would have like the issuer like.

67
00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:12.450
Hart Montgomery: Because these proofs can be expensive so i'd have like the issue approved to like all of the blockchain nodes or something that you know that their credentials are good.

68
00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:26.940
Cam Parra | kiva.org: right but it wouldn't even need to be in zero knowledge, because, because the issuer could hit themselves do a proof, you know or somehow.

69
00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:29.010
Cam Parra | kiva.org: know that they're pink you.

70
00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:35.730
Hart Montgomery: It doesn't need to be in zero knowledge right because you can't reveal these right, otherwise the you can factor, the issuer's.

71
00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:37.680
Hart Montgomery: Key.

72
00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:38.790
Right.

73
00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:46.950
Cam Parra | kiva.org: I guess, but the issue or nose of the p amp Q right already.

74
00:07:47.010 --> 00:07:50.130
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Also, they don't need to disclose it, they just need to make the proof.

75
00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:51.240
Cam Parra | kiva.org: The issue I guess yeah.

76
00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:59.760
Hart Montgomery: they're proving it to someone else that it's a solid they're basically so what they're doing right if you're familiar with the discrete log problem right.

77
00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:00.780
Cam Parra | kiva.org: yeah yeah.

78
00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:05.070
Hart Montgomery: So discrete log problems is hard for.

79
00:08:06.630 --> 00:08:08.700
Hart Montgomery: For prime order sickly groups right.

80
00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:12.510
Hart Montgomery: yep, it is not hard for like.

81
00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:21.480
Hart Montgomery: For like Z to to the end right so it's not hard if you're a group order is like a power of two right.

82
00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:26.070
Hart Montgomery: Right and you can sort of like this is a standard like.

83
00:08:27.390 --> 00:08:39.750
Hart Montgomery: intro to crypto like homework problem is right, an efficient algorithm for discrete log when the group sizes to to the end for some ahead.

84
00:08:45.270 --> 00:08:54.210
Hart Montgomery: So, so the point is right that you're just proving that one of these pink you are in fact like primordial right.

85
00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:55.590
Right.

86
00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:02.940
Hart Montgomery: And that means like the issuer can't solve discrete log over them.

87
00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:08.280
Hart Montgomery: Which, which is important for this this scheme right.

88
00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:09.840
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Right.

89
00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:11.310
So.

90
00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:24.990
Hart Montgomery: So yes, so the issue would be the approval right and the holder or anyone who's interacting with the issue or and, once this proof will be the verify right.

91
00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:26.280
Right.

92
00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:31.230
Hart Montgomery: So, you said you were having some trouble with notation.

93
00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:35.220
Cam Parra | kiva.org: um I think I got the notation now.

94
00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:36.330
Okay.

95
00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:55.350
Cam Parra | kiva.org: yeah just this just so we have to clarify this flow because because um I guess yeah the I guess i'm in indy and in a in an Aries you know your verifiers is a separate entity.

96
00:09:57.210 --> 00:10:03.930
Cam Parra | kiva.org: And you know now saying that the holder is verifying something we would have to clarify that.

97
00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:09.810
Hart Montgomery: yeah so the thing you're verifying two different things right.

98
00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:16.140
Hart Montgomery: Right, the verified india's verified the credentials right.

99
00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:23.790
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Right and this you're verifying the that you that you're the person was issuing to you is.

100
00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:30.750
Hart Montgomery: trustworthy so if you're if you're worried about it call it like public key verification right.

101
00:10:31.830 --> 00:10:32.280
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Right.

102
00:10:32.610 --> 00:10:38.550
Hart Montgomery: And you can call it like pk verify or something right to not be confused with regular verify.

103
00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:40.020
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Right.

104
00:10:40.770 --> 00:10:42.960
Hart Montgomery: So seems like a reasonable thing.

105
00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:55.500
Cam Parra | kiva.org: yeah yeah that that changes up my thinking because adding it to the code to to the actual bear fire that's That would be completely different, while we need to add this to a shoe or and the holder.

106
00:10:55.710 --> 00:10:57.390
Hart Montgomery: it's a different proof right you're proving.

107
00:10:57.420 --> 00:10:58.890
Hart Montgomery: Right so.

108
00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:09.810
Hart Montgomery: So it shouldn't be equivalent to the like, if you are being really pedantic right you'd call it credential verify right, that would be your normal verify.

109
00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:10.800
Right.

110
00:11:13.050 --> 00:11:21.510
Hart Montgomery: And then this would be like public key verify, but because, like the credential verifiers domain verify or it's just been called verify right.

111
00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:22.860
Right.

112
00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:39.030
Cam Parra | kiva.org: cool cool yeah Those are just some of my questions about about how, because we all have to explain to the fact that communities of how this will like how the patch will disrupt their flow or I guess change their flow.

113
00:11:39.450 --> 00:11:41.700
Hart Montgomery: It shouldn't disrupt the flow really much at all right.

114
00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:45.960
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Now yeah yeah it's just adding a step into the issuance.

115
00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:48.840
Hart Montgomery: Well, but you don't even have to write like.

116
00:11:50.190 --> 00:11:55.650
Hart Montgomery: You know, you might So if you trust the issue or you don't have to do this at all right.

117
00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.450
Hart Montgomery: Or if you just hit her it's like honest but curious right.

118
00:12:01.650 --> 00:12:21.060
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Well, we can't like what i've come to to to think, is that you can't even trust any issue or Unless this is done, because you know what if someone is using like an old like you know, a corrupted hsm or you know or they've been been side channel, and you know they're.

119
00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:23.820
Cam Parra | kiva.org: So something messed with their prime generation.

120
00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:31.620
Hart Montgomery: yeah that's that's true yeah I mean this would be a non technically be a non honest issuer.

121
00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:34.740
Hart Montgomery: So yeah no I mean if but.

122
00:12:34.770 --> 00:12:42.870
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Even that would be not honest, but also that it could be someone who you think is honest and like and now is.

123
00:12:43.530 --> 00:12:47.820
Hart Montgomery: hijacked it yeah and I use this you're you're absolutely right.

124
00:12:49.440 --> 00:13:01.920
Hart Montgomery: In this case, this is the technical term but I use the example you're giving all the time to justify why people should use Byzantine fault tolerant consensus, instead of crash fault tolerant consensus right.

125
00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:07.470
Hart Montgomery: Right, you may trust people, but what happens if they you know if they're compromised.

126
00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:16.560
Hart Montgomery: But you could also require that like you know if the issue is out of blockchain right.

127
00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:20.100
Hart Montgomery: And you trust the blockchain right.

128
00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:30.870
Hart Montgomery: you trust the blockchain collectively, you could have the issue or prove like this proof to the blockchain nodes right.

129
00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:35.520
Hart Montgomery: Who could then work to accept the credentials right.

130
00:13:37.410 --> 00:13:50.700
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Right right so yeah yeah when when they go to add their credential definition with their with their signatures, the I guess the the blockchain decides if it's trustworthy or not.

131
00:13:51.090 --> 00:13:57.210
Hart Montgomery: And so the proof couldn't issue to the blockchain right and if I trust the blockchain that I don't need to do this every time right.

132
00:13:57.420 --> 00:13:58.320
Nathan George: And that's what I talked.

133
00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:03.030
Nathan George: About before can with the idea of adding it to the credential definition is it's.

134
00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:03.510
it's.

135
00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:13.530
Nathan George: The credit death transaction on on indie checked proof, then you know that any credential definition anchor to chain had this check.

136
00:14:14.010 --> 00:14:18.600
Hart Montgomery: Exactly, and this would save a lot of efficiency to right because.

137
00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:22.050
Hart Montgomery: yeah you're holder might be a lightweight wallet right.

138
00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:25.770
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Right yeah yeah it might be a mobile wallet yeah.

139
00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:26.640
Nathan George: You know.

140
00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:35.310
Nathan George: It also lets you pitch it to the issuer is it's it's part of just checking to make sure the crypto they had enough entropy when you generate the keys.

141
00:14:35.970 --> 00:14:42.150
Hart Montgomery: Well, so that you had enough entropy is that you like generated your your key correctly right.

142
00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:46.860
Hart Montgomery: Right, the money low income, like a low entropy thing will still pass right.

143
00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:55.470
Nathan George: yeah that's true but, but it's a check to say you didn't nothing happened that caused you to pick that Christ.

144
00:14:56.250 --> 00:15:07.470
Hart Montgomery: Yes, well yeah you are picking correct problems, you might pick low entropy you might like you know something like a hard coded key would pass right but.

145
00:15:08.730 --> 00:15:14.370
Hart Montgomery: yeah it's still like it can be pitched to the issue of that way as well right.

146
00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:23.160
Nathan George: Well, and it also puts a spot architectural into the code where other checks could also go like you could check for duplicate keys, you could check for a few other things yeah.

147
00:15:23.190 --> 00:15:24.900
Nathan George: Yes, if that comes up later.

148
00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:33.480
Hart Montgomery: I mean, have you all seen the Nadia had anger study the old one of the gc D of all the RSA keys on the Internet.

149
00:15:35.550 --> 00:15:36.240
Cam Parra | kiva.org: I haven't no.

150
00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:37.230
Nathan George: that's awesome.

151
00:15:38.490 --> 00:15:39.930
Hart Montgomery: So so basically.

152
00:15:42.030 --> 00:15:45.150
Hart Montgomery: So so you're aware that factoring hard.

153
00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:52.290
Hart Montgomery: But a problem called greatest common divisor is easy right So if you have two numbers right.

154
00:15:53.460 --> 00:15:58.410
Hart Montgomery: And they have a factor in common it's very easy to find an extract this factor.

155
00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:02.520
Hart Montgomery: What this means, if you have.

156
00:16:04.050 --> 00:16:12.480
Hart Montgomery: If there's some way that you've like reused, an RSA factor on the Internet, then you are totally screwed right.

157
00:16:13.530 --> 00:16:25.350
Hart Montgomery: And so what these smart people got the idea to idea to do is let's download every RSA key that we can find a run this gct algorithm on them pairwise and yet.

158
00:16:26.010 --> 00:16:26.310
it's.

159
00:16:27.810 --> 00:16:35.610
Hart Montgomery: Like people are not very good about like you know necessarily generating PRIMES and there was a lot of overlap.

160
00:16:35.910 --> 00:16:37.650
Nathan George: I really want to see this paper right.

161
00:16:37.950 --> 00:16:38.880
Hart Montgomery: it's like not.

162
00:16:40.650 --> 00:16:44.670
Hart Montgomery: Let me see if I can find it quickly got a lot of attention just because it was.

163
00:16:48.390 --> 00:16:51.930
Nathan George: I think I remember the couple articles related to this came at.

164
00:16:56.220 --> 00:17:00.300
Hart Montgomery: This is a somebody else did Okay, so they did that and.

165
00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:07.770
Hart Montgomery: Okay, it might.

166
00:17:11.430 --> 00:17:13.620
Hart Montgomery: detection of wides is this it.

167
00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:17.910
Hart Montgomery: yeah.

168
00:17:22.590 --> 00:17:24.150
Hart Montgomery: yeah This, I think this is it.

169
00:17:32.190 --> 00:17:36.990
Hart Montgomery: They found that point seven 5% of telus certificates shared keys.

170
00:17:41.490 --> 00:17:42.030
Cam Parra | kiva.org: that's funny.

171
00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:46.140
Hart Montgomery: We make sure that this is the right paper, I think it is.

172
00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:48.870
Hart Montgomery: yeah.

173
00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:57.630
Hart Montgomery: This is one of them anyway posted in the chat.

174
00:18:05.130 --> 00:18:07.710
Hart Montgomery: If there's anything earlier that paper should site it.

175
00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:20.400
Hart Montgomery: yeah.

176
00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:24.030
Hart Montgomery: anyway.

177
00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:40.920
Hart Montgomery: yeah.

178
00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:44.340
Hart Montgomery: Lots of problems.

179
00:18:47.190 --> 00:18:48.660
Cam Parra | kiva.org: naughty naughty as always.

180
00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:53.310
Cam Parra | kiva.org: i'm doing my stuff to make people.

181
00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:56.760
Hart Montgomery: Fantastic yeah.

182
00:18:59.160 --> 00:18:59.760
Hart Montgomery: So.

183
00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:03.780
Hart Montgomery: yeah it's a.

184
00:19:07.650 --> 00:19:23.880
Cam Parra | kiva.org: um yeah so so um i'll note that yeah that we have to that this would be better anchored on like whatever trusted storage is because we want to I guess stay agnostic to whatever storage.

185
00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:45.060
Cam Parra | kiva.org: It is all specifically mentioned that that indie could could anchor it to its credit, deaths um I guess there'll be a harder selling point for some people who, because that will invalidate well that will change up their credential they'll they'll be a basically a V2 credentials now.

186
00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:49.200
Hart Montgomery: Why should they have to change their credential right.

187
00:19:49.650 --> 00:19:50.820
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Well, their credit depths.

188
00:19:52.830 --> 00:20:01.890
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Because you'll be adding a new field now with a proof, with a proof that that states that their signature is it was generated would save crimes.

189
00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:06.810
Hart Montgomery: Do you mean you don't do you have to add, I mean.

190
00:20:08.370 --> 00:20:10.920
Hart Montgomery: Do you have to change that like.

191
00:20:12.270 --> 00:20:15.990
Hart Montgomery: My thought was you just prove it to the blockchain.

192
00:20:18.990 --> 00:20:23.070
Hart Montgomery: It might not you might not like what or need to write down the whole proof right.

193
00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:29.520
Cam Parra | kiva.org: I will I don't I don't know how we would prove that to the blockchain.

194
00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:31.920
Hart Montgomery: Well, you just prove it to like.

195
00:20:35.010 --> 00:20:38.310
Hart Montgomery: It well, I mean the issuer can just.

196
00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:46.710
Cam Parra | kiva.org: I guess yeah I guess that makes sense, like there's like the verification like there's the verification that you can write on the ledger.

197
00:20:47.310 --> 00:20:47.760
Cam Parra | kiva.org: yeah like.

198
00:20:47.790 --> 00:20:58.800
Cam Parra | kiva.org: You would do the same thing that that you would verify that this whoever's writing to to this writing this credit is allowed to be to do, be doing it and also.

199
00:21:00.270 --> 00:21:01.710
Cam Parra | kiva.org: doing it with safe prime's.

200
00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:08.460
Hart Montgomery: I mean the the things right, this doesn't require a credential change at all right so it's not a.

201
00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:11.880
Hart Montgomery: it's not a super heavyweight change right.

202
00:21:13.110 --> 00:21:20.550
Hart Montgomery: You just need to like throw on these proofs somewhere, and if you haven't blockchain you can literally just toss them on the chain right.

203
00:21:21.930 --> 00:21:22.380
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Right.

204
00:21:22.590 --> 00:21:37.590
Hart Montgomery: Or you could have the you know you don't even need to toss them on the chain, you can just have the issue approved to all of the blockchain nodes or some some some number of blockchain nodes and have this recorded on the chain right.

205
00:21:38.610 --> 00:21:39.060
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Right.

206
00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:47.160
Hart Montgomery: So I mean how you want to do this is sort of like what what's the best fit for the indie community.

207
00:21:49.830 --> 00:22:00.090
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Right yeah whatever is is least disruptive is probably what what what will be best because yeah yeah just because people already have issued credentials.

208
00:22:01.470 --> 00:22:01.860
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Things.

209
00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:04.830
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Things written on the ledger like current devastating number ledger's.

210
00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:08.940
Hart Montgomery: I don't know what's least disruptive though right that's my.

211
00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:10.470
Cam Parra | kiva.org: yeah I guess I.

212
00:22:11.910 --> 00:22:14.490
Hart Montgomery: would consider the least disruptive anyway right.

213
00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:16.560
Cam Parra | kiva.org: What would you think Nathan.

214
00:22:20.550 --> 00:22:38.910
Nathan George: Well, the most of our current customers for the crypto library are working in closed loop ecosystems, where they have control or support at least significant ish influence over all of the participants, so the idea that we add the check.

215
00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:49.440
Nathan George: In the in the library, the code it's easy to invoke and then we tell everyone hey you should go check everyone's keys to make sure everyone's doing okay.

216
00:22:51.810 --> 00:23:03.570
Nathan George: seems like an easy thing to ask, and then, if we have it, so that the you know either the end transaction my favorite place to put this.

217
00:23:04.470 --> 00:23:12.330
Nathan George: will verify the check or you can configure any to not verify the check, but by default we configure it to present and verify the check.

218
00:23:12.990 --> 00:23:25.560
Nathan George: I think we were wearing a spot where we've done everything we need to do to pass the bug and I don't think anyone would who didn't want to or making intentional choice to stay vulnerable would be in any way vulnerable.

219
00:23:28.020 --> 00:23:29.460
Hart Montgomery: yeah that seems.

220
00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:39.870
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Oh you're saying that the check would be not tolerable in in in an ursa, but it would be terrible in India layer

221
00:23:40.740 --> 00:23:42.750
Nathan George: yeah what i'm saying is it would.

222
00:23:42.810 --> 00:23:49.230
Nathan George: automatically actors doesn't compose the protocol anyway, and then it would be.

223
00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:52.560
Nathan George: A when you create the credential definition.

224
00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:56.550
Nathan George: you'd have a config for the blockchain So if you block chain.

225
00:23:57.930 --> 00:24:01.800
Nathan George: configuration That said, do I checked the PRIMES.

226
00:24:02.820 --> 00:24:09.120
Nathan George: As part of the credential definition and that would add a couple of data fields to the credit def object that went on the on the ledger.

227
00:24:09.450 --> 00:24:15.450
Nathan George: Because he would probably also want to save something about the proof on chain, so that someone else who wanted to validate.

228
00:24:15.870 --> 00:24:21.300
Nathan George: blockchain state could validate it because typically with an interview chain, we don't just think that.

229
00:24:21.750 --> 00:24:28.950
Nathan George: The validator nodes validate the transaction, but we keep enough data that anyone who wanted to observe the network can validate the transactions.

230
00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:35.580
Nathan George: Because it's kind of a copy left type approach, because everyone who joins is a valid you know, science, the trust Framework Agreement.

231
00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:47.850
Nathan George: And so, if someone from the outside, can catch you doing the wrong thing, according to the trust Framework Agreement it's a way of keeping the whole network honest because they've they've agreed to stake their reputation on doing on following the rules.

232
00:24:49.470 --> 00:24:49.860
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Right.

233
00:24:50.310 --> 00:24:51.600
Hart Montgomery: I agree with your.

234
00:24:52.950 --> 00:24:56.760
Hart Montgomery: basic idea that this, you could have this code is a.

235
00:24:57.960 --> 00:24:59.700
Hart Montgomery: State A callable function.

236
00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:07.950
Hart Montgomery: But it shouldn't necessarily be a vote it every invoked at a higher layer not there, so there.

237
00:25:09.870 --> 00:25:15.390
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Okay, so yeah so this would be just something I guess, this would be a whole new.

238
00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:20.400
Cam Parra | kiva.org: I guess class or whatever we decided to do it.

239
00:25:20.490 --> 00:25:26.520
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Different with the issuer and the holder, it would just be like cl signature verification.

240
00:25:26.730 --> 00:25:27.540
Hart Montgomery: Well, it would be.

241
00:25:28.050 --> 00:25:31.620
Hart Montgomery: It would be an issue or function right, so the issue or call the function.

242
00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:34.530
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Right we're all right right right right.

243
00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:42.060
Hart Montgomery: So the issue would be an interactive thing right, but all the bulk of the work would be done by the issuer right.

244
00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:42.660
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Right.

245
00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:48.000
Hart Montgomery: So someone asked issue or like a issue or approve your problems are good right.

246
00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:59.160
Hart Montgomery: And then the issuer has, you know that maybe they send the issue or some randomness but you probably do it not interactively right, and then you just.

247
00:26:03.750 --> 00:26:07.620
Hart Montgomery: The issuer has all the information, so you can just do it from there right.

248
00:26:08.190 --> 00:26:11.520
Hart Montgomery: Right, so it should just entirely be an issue of think.

249
00:26:14.190 --> 00:26:14.880
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Okay cool.

250
00:26:15.180 --> 00:26:18.060
Hart Montgomery: So, like you, shouldn't need a new class or anything like that right.

251
00:26:18.540 --> 00:26:20.670
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Right, it should just be included into the issuer.

252
00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:24.330
Hart Montgomery: just another function that the issuer can do right.

253
00:26:24.660 --> 00:26:25.050
Right.

254
00:26:26.730 --> 00:26:27.150
Cam Parra | kiva.org: and

255
00:26:28.500 --> 00:26:37.410
Cam Parra | kiva.org: yeah I guess that makes sense yeah that totally makes sense and yeah it doesn't have to be invoked by ursa and it can be invoked by Andy.

256
00:26:38.940 --> 00:26:50.730
Hart Montgomery: yeah or whoever else right and again like this is something where you're like your trust model right will interfere outside infrastructure will determine how often or where you want to call this function right.

257
00:26:51.300 --> 00:27:02.070
Hart Montgomery: Right, this is the same for sort of all of the like proof of like well forums public key things we've been talking about and all these security issues right.

258
00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:04.620
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Right.

259
00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:07.320
Cam Parra | kiva.org: The paper doesn't make it sound like.

260
00:27:07.710 --> 00:27:14.430
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Like ursa is the one that's not implementing this and therefore breaking people.

261
00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:20.070
Cam Parra | kiva.org: or like you know, causing the vulnerability, but we'll have to restate it as.

262
00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:25.380
Cam Parra | kiva.org: We offer the solution, but we don't we don't enforce it.

263
00:27:26.220 --> 00:27:40.200
Hart Montgomery: yeah, and this is like a classic, this is a trade off you're writing like cryptographic or secure code right on one hand you like you have sort of like you know.

264
00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:45.840
Hart Montgomery: iron cladding things and making them misuse resistant right.

265
00:27:47.910 --> 00:27:59.100
Hart Montgomery: On the other hand, you have sort of like giving people more flexibility, you know, maybe this is more rope for them to hang themselves, but this is also also lets you build a lot more efficient protocols right.

266
00:27:59.580 --> 00:28:06.570
Hart Montgomery: right if i'm reusing public keys right or if i'm using credentials like I only need to check them once right.

267
00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:08.310
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Right.

268
00:28:09.060 --> 00:28:17.490
Hart Montgomery: And if I have a blockchain in check credentials right, I can chat have the blockchain check them and just record that, on the blockchain right.

269
00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:24.210
Hart Montgomery: Right and then there's sort of like no need to you know reach out credentials right.

270
00:28:25.260 --> 00:28:25.710
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Right.

271
00:28:25.890 --> 00:28:31.530
Hart Montgomery: I got on Mike over this for like the bbs plus stuff a while back and he's just like well you know.

272
00:28:33.630 --> 00:28:38.100
Hart Montgomery: The blockchain just needs to check the month so we're not gonna we're not going to call this right.

273
00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:45.900
Cam Parra | kiva.org: yeah Mike still seems pretty opposed to the idea of this of this checking.

274
00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:48.630
Cam Parra | kiva.org: To see if brian's.

275
00:28:50.430 --> 00:28:52.050
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Last time I spoke, I spoke to him.

276
00:28:53.670 --> 00:28:55.470
Hart Montgomery: Well, I mean it's not like.

277
00:28:57.210 --> 00:29:00.570
Hart Montgomery: You don't need to do it like repetitively it's an efficiency issue right.

278
00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:02.730
Hart Montgomery: Right so.

279
00:29:04.530 --> 00:29:07.740
Hart Montgomery: Like having the functionality out there is definitely good.

280
00:29:12.990 --> 00:29:13.800
Hart Montgomery: But.

281
00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:19.710
Hart Montgomery: yeah I mean we let people use it as they see fit.

282
00:29:20.550 --> 00:29:34.260
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Right um the so the the protocol for checking that a pink you are safe PRIMES that jaan stated that's just a logic, like a logic game.

283
00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:36.120
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Protocol rate.

284
00:29:36.330 --> 00:29:37.590
Hart Montgomery: A logical practical.

285
00:29:37.620 --> 00:29:46.110
Cam Parra | kiva.org: or it's just going through like it says and doing a bunch of ads in order to prove that it's that it that it is safe right.

286
00:29:47.730 --> 00:29:49.950
Cam Parra | kiva.org: that's what the notation that I.

287
00:29:50.250 --> 00:29:51.900
Hart Montgomery: Were you looking exactly.

288
00:29:52.380 --> 00:29:52.800
Page.

289
00:29:59.460 --> 00:30:01.830
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Of the proving zero knowledge, the.

290
00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:05.070
Cam Parra | kiva.org: number is a product of to see prime's.

291
00:30:06.180 --> 00:30:06.600
Cam Parra | kiva.org: speech.

292
00:30:06.780 --> 00:30:07.440
working.

293
00:30:09.780 --> 00:30:10.710
Cam Parra | kiva.org: I can get you.

294
00:30:11.580 --> 00:30:12.540
Hart Montgomery: Page 13.

295
00:30:13.050 --> 00:30:13.470
yeah.

296
00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:17.400
Hart Montgomery: Yes, the the carrot thing is and right.

297
00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:21.300
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Right so it's just like a logic gate kind of.

298
00:30:21.930 --> 00:30:33.870
Hart Montgomery: yeah so really they're only using that they're they're checking a bunch of conditions and they're like yeah they're verifying that like numbers are in certain bounds right.

299
00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:36.510
Hart Montgomery: Right, those are range proves.

300
00:30:37.350 --> 00:30:38.760
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Okay that's what it's called.

301
00:30:39.900 --> 00:30:41.790
Hart Montgomery: yeah they're super common right.

302
00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:42.870
Right.

303
00:30:46.110 --> 00:30:47.220
Hart Montgomery: So yeah.

304
00:30:51.810 --> 00:30:52.140
Cam Parra | kiva.org: well.

305
00:30:53.430 --> 00:30:53.820
Hart Montgomery: yeah.

306
00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:54.630
Cam Parra | kiva.org: yeah well this.

307
00:30:55.380 --> 00:30:56.610
Hart Montgomery: hope that all make sense.

308
00:30:57.390 --> 00:31:01.380
Cam Parra | kiva.org: yeah this, this would give me enough to add some more.

309
00:31:02.700 --> 00:31:07.380
Cam Parra | kiva.org: substance to the how we're going to patch this and how it should be used.

310
00:31:09.300 --> 00:31:09.810
Hart Montgomery: awesome.

311
00:31:11.250 --> 00:31:14.970
Cam Parra | kiva.org: yeah we're working that currently like at kiva and so.

312
00:31:16.740 --> 00:31:18.030
it's just interesting that.

313
00:31:19.950 --> 00:31:23.220
Hart Montgomery: This is kind of a cool thing right we hit we hit a crypto bug.

314
00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:27.420
Hart Montgomery: it's relatively uncommon.

315
00:31:30.210 --> 00:31:36.360
Cam Parra | kiva.org: yeah it's really cool it's I guess it's just it's a bug but also like just an oversight.

316
00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:40.500
Hart Montgomery: Well, most things are like oversights right.

317
00:31:41.730 --> 00:31:50.940
Hart Montgomery: If something makes it like this far it's usually not like there's usually not like a fatal flaw it's usually like you forgot something and like.

318
00:31:53.850 --> 00:31:55.470
Hart Montgomery: And like it is sort of.

319
00:31:57.600 --> 00:31:58.020
Hart Montgomery: Are there.

320
00:31:59.610 --> 00:32:02.730
Cam Parra | kiva.org: You go there you aware of any other libraries that do this, that.

321
00:32:03.150 --> 00:32:03.870
Cam Parra | kiva.org: That check.

322
00:32:04.260 --> 00:32:07.230
Hart Montgomery: there's one using paper right that they.

323
00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:10.860
Hart Montgomery: They do they have the check it's not in Resto.

324
00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:15.780
Hart Montgomery: I think I told you that earlier it's alluded to in that paper.

325
00:32:16.230 --> 00:32:17.880
Cam Parra | kiva.org: into which one into.

326
00:32:18.750 --> 00:32:21.150
Hart Montgomery: into the issue report.

327
00:32:21.660 --> 00:32:22.620
Cam Parra | kiva.org: To the paper okay.

328
00:32:23.670 --> 00:32:39.660
Hart Montgomery: So they they have another library, but it's in like I want to say it's in like go or something weird So if you want to like make a resolution you can probably just look at their code and just effectively translate into rest.

329
00:32:41.250 --> 00:32:42.660
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Okay that's cool.

330
00:32:43.020 --> 00:32:48.900
Hart Montgomery: That might be a lot easier than writing it from scratch, you want to make sure they're doing it correctly.

331
00:32:49.980 --> 00:32:50.460
Hart Montgomery: But.

332
00:32:51.870 --> 00:32:52.440
Hart Montgomery: yeah.

333
00:32:55.170 --> 00:32:57.060
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Right um.

334
00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:01.560
Cam Parra | kiva.org: yeah yeah well.

335
00:33:02.970 --> 00:33:10.170
Cam Parra | kiva.org: What we probably can bring up some of the maintainer is that the current containers and have them review whatever solutions put in.

336
00:33:11.010 --> 00:33:12.660
Cam Parra | kiva.org: The more of the crypto folks.

337
00:33:12.810 --> 00:33:13.230
Hart Montgomery: mm hmm.

338
00:33:14.970 --> 00:33:15.720
Cam Parra | kiva.org: i'm trying to.

339
00:33:15.810 --> 00:33:19.980
Hart Montgomery: get more crypto people to to get involved.

340
00:33:21.990 --> 00:33:24.420
Hart Montgomery: So we'll we'll see how successful is.

341
00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:29.970
Cam Parra | kiva.org: yeah no worries right now we have like I like I stated like at the beginning of the call is like that.

342
00:33:30.390 --> 00:33:41.940
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Where yeah, I guess, we need to be heads down and just fix this because that there is, I will you guys at the hyper ledger are going to release this at some point right.

343
00:33:41.970 --> 00:33:42.660
Hart Montgomery: publicly.

344
00:33:43.230 --> 00:33:44.400
Cam Parra | kiva.org: And so we need to beat that.

345
00:33:45.870 --> 00:33:46.320
Hart Montgomery: So.

346
00:33:48.540 --> 00:33:49.050
Cam Parra | kiva.org: um.

347
00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:50.790
Hart Montgomery: I mean this is like a good.

348
00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:52.350
Hart Montgomery: Like.

349
00:33:54.810 --> 00:33:58.140
Hart Montgomery: This is a good security experience right, we should probably.

350
00:33:59.670 --> 00:34:03.240
Hart Montgomery: We should write like a blog post about or something once we get everything done.

351
00:34:04.860 --> 00:34:12.990
Nathan George: Yes, right as soon as the frustration camp feels for having people tell them that i'm not sure we have to fix this dies down yes.

352
00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:16.650
Hart Montgomery: Right like it's always like.

353
00:34:18.120 --> 00:34:18.600
You know.

354
00:34:20.460 --> 00:34:27.390
Nathan George: for clarification what's the clock at when did when what what's the when did this bug get disclose to us how long do we have.

355
00:34:29.190 --> 00:34:29.970
Hart Montgomery: unclear.

356
00:34:32.160 --> 00:34:39.450
Hart Montgomery: Like it got disclosed, like the first like technical disclosure was a while ago, but we were just kind of like.

357
00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:42.750
Hart Montgomery: We only got the paper like.

358
00:34:44.670 --> 00:34:46.080
Hart Montgomery: I want to say, like January.

359
00:34:48.630 --> 00:34:49.440
Hart Montgomery: They.

360
00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:52.980
Nathan George: As longer ago than I thought interesting.

361
00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:56.940
Hart Montgomery: yeah Maybe it was I want to say, I want to say that was right.

362
00:34:59.190 --> 00:35:15.510
Hart Montgomery: But no, the problem was that the guys who founded are not cryptographers and they did like a bad job of explaining it initially so we were just like dismissive of them at first, because you know you'll see this, are you on the security list.

363
00:35:17.910 --> 00:35:19.740
Hart Montgomery: For a SEC camp.

364
00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:21.570
Cam Parra | kiva.org: i'm not.

365
00:35:21.990 --> 00:35:26.700
Hart Montgomery: Okay, do you want to be on the like security folder the security disclosure list.

366
00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:28.170
Cam Parra | kiva.org: yeah that'd be great.

367
00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:37.410
Hart Montgomery: So may I think right controls that so you can mail right and CC me, and so you want to be on this we get we get a lot of like false bugs basically.

368
00:35:40.020 --> 00:35:44.370
Hart Montgomery: And some of them are more trickier to falsified and others.

369
00:35:45.390 --> 00:35:51.390
Hart Montgomery: So these guys did a bad job of explaining it and we're just kind of like what are you talking about.

370
00:35:52.530 --> 00:35:53.040
Hart Montgomery: But.

371
00:35:54.510 --> 00:35:55.680
Hart Montgomery: You know, like.

372
00:35:57.570 --> 00:36:04.380
Hart Montgomery: they're friendly This is like, not the highest priority thing.

373
00:36:08.370 --> 00:36:08.850
Hart Montgomery: You know.

374
00:36:10.110 --> 00:36:15.420
Hart Montgomery: Do what you can you know don't kill yourself over this like.

375
00:36:19.650 --> 00:36:24.600
Hart Montgomery: yeah I don't know like whatever whatever timeline we can get is fine, you know.

376
00:36:31.230 --> 00:36:46.170
Cam Parra | kiva.org: yeah what's interesting about this like, at least for I guess what we've been like preaching at a at areas in hyper ledger is that the cl signatures or more secure than the implementation of bbs plus or not more.

377
00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:47.970
Hart Montgomery: preaching the opposite.

378
00:36:50.070 --> 00:36:52.440
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Well there's there's two fields right there's.

379
00:36:52.830 --> 00:36:53.430
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Always yes.

380
00:36:53.580 --> 00:36:55.230
Hart Montgomery: Will to use bbs plus.

381
00:36:56.130 --> 00:37:08.790
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Well, the bbs plus doesn't come with with with a lot of the benefits that seal signatures come with like being able to do like revocation right.

382
00:37:09.750 --> 00:37:10.290
Hart Montgomery: uh huh.

383
00:37:10.620 --> 00:37:12.270
Cam Parra | kiva.org: And or being able to do.

384
00:37:14.370 --> 00:37:15.450
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Proof predicates right.

385
00:37:16.890 --> 00:37:17.460
Hart Montgomery: sure.

386
00:37:18.450 --> 00:37:19.380
Cam Parra | kiva.org: And so.

387
00:37:19.890 --> 00:37:23.940
Hart Montgomery: With this is a functionality issue rather than a security issue right.

388
00:37:26.730 --> 00:37:28.140
Cam Parra | kiva.org: yeah I guess so yeah so we were.

389
00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:31.980
Cam Parra | kiva.org: We were toting a lot more functionality for cl.

390
00:37:32.310 --> 00:37:40.740
Cam Parra | kiva.org: And now that the with this bug it's almost yeah you're now you're now we're like at the same as bbs.

391
00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:44.760
Hart Montgomery: i've always been telling people to be best plus.

392
00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:47.940
Hart Montgomery: So his MIC I think.

393
00:37:49.170 --> 00:37:54.840
Cam Parra | kiva.org: yeah the whole community is behind me via media or like a lot of the Communities behind bbs.

394
00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:58.380
Nathan George: everyone's interested, but the invitation is not done yet enough, is it.

395
00:38:00.300 --> 00:38:02.280
Cam Parra | kiva.org: No, I don't think so I it doesn't.

396
00:38:02.820 --> 00:38:04.800
Nathan George: really wants to be done, the work to make an APP.

397
00:38:05.010 --> 00:38:05.460
Hart Montgomery: It looks like.

398
00:38:06.750 --> 00:38:07.590
Cam Parra | kiva.org: For PBS.

399
00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:11.340
Hart Montgomery: PBS Plus we have a bbs plus signature implementation.

400
00:38:12.090 --> 00:38:12.990
Cam Parra | kiva.org: yeah we'll do.

401
00:38:13.080 --> 00:38:14.100
Nathan George: Preferential protocol.

402
00:38:14.970 --> 00:38:17.400
Hart Montgomery: We don't have the credentials protocol sure yeah.

403
00:38:18.750 --> 00:38:20.940
Cam Parra | kiva.org: yeah this credentials protocol still being.

404
00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:29.460
Cam Parra | kiva.org: talked about in the diff Mike and yeah it's been like a year tune or year now and they're still debating it so.

405
00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:30.690
yeah.

406
00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:37.140
Cam Parra | kiva.org: So yeah so but I guess like the cl signature is offered a more established.

407
00:38:40.440 --> 00:39:00.180
Cam Parra | kiva.org: credential issuance but yeah yeah so so that's like my only worry is that we're we're we're not like we don't like meet the expectations that we that we set with people and that's why we have to get this out, but yeah agreed that it's not like, I guess, like.

408
00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:06.390
Cam Parra | kiva.org: magic like i've only listed in this position was moderate not severe.

409
00:39:10.350 --> 00:39:12.060
Hart Montgomery: yeah I mean.

410
00:39:15.960 --> 00:39:19.440
Hart Montgomery: You know this is we just get it fixed like.

411
00:39:20.970 --> 00:39:24.240
Hart Montgomery: We do a post mortem you know.

412
00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:31.710
Hart Montgomery: yeah I mean it's it's like a good like hey we're keeping on top of you know, like.

413
00:39:35.490 --> 00:39:38.790
Hart Montgomery: yeah it's an interesting interesting thing right.

414
00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:40.860
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Right so.

415
00:39:45.930 --> 00:39:49.710
Hart Montgomery: lots of people, bigger than us have made substantially worse mistakes.

416
00:39:52.860 --> 00:39:56.340
Hart Montgomery: And this is like this is a paper mistake so.

417
00:39:58.620 --> 00:39:59.040
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Right.

418
00:40:01.650 --> 00:40:14.310
Cam Parra | kiva.org: um that's oh yeah that that leads me to another question um so when we have this quote it up will, will you be able to help us add this to the non credit paper or would you prefer someone like Brendan to do that.

419
00:40:17.040 --> 00:40:21.060
Hart Montgomery: I can, is there a reason you need me to add it to the unknown Chris paper.

420
00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:30.600
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Well um it's well, we need to add it to the to the protocol don't we.

421
00:40:31.530 --> 00:40:35.850
Hart Montgomery: yeah I mean I guess the threads paper probably needs to be updated period.

422
00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:37.050
Right.

423
00:40:38.520 --> 00:40:39.270
Hart Montgomery: So.

424
00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:41.100
Hart Montgomery: yeah we should.

425
00:40:43.410 --> 00:40:45.000
Hart Montgomery: We should go over that at some point.

426
00:40:48.540 --> 00:40:53.430
Hart Montgomery: there's probably more than needs to be updated I don't think it's in a very good stereo now.

427
00:40:55.980 --> 00:40:58.710
Cam Parra | kiva.org: i'll add that, on my to do list to bring that up.

428
00:40:59.310 --> 00:41:00.120
Hart Montgomery: i'm happily.

429
00:41:00.690 --> 00:41:02.160
Hart Montgomery: I can help some with that.

430
00:41:06.210 --> 00:41:08.040
Hart Montgomery: We I doubt this is the only thing.

431
00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:09.720
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Okay.

432
00:41:14.760 --> 00:41:22.890
Cam Parra | kiva.org: yeah that would be like i'm trying to think of how you would introduce that into a non creds because again it's something that I guess you would have to.

433
00:41:24.270 --> 00:41:31.320
Cam Parra | kiva.org: it's up to the implementation, but I guess it's implemented or non credit and non credit says to state that this is part of their flow now.

434
00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:32.790
Hart Montgomery: yeah.

435
00:41:34.080 --> 00:41:34.530
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Okay.

436
00:41:36.990 --> 00:41:58.650
Cam Parra | kiva.org: cool cool um and I guess the last thing is my concern of if this is pretty being presented by open ID or the or the ID lab sorry folks like as one of the vulnerabilities they found on their audit at the World Forum, we just need to make sure that this is presented correctly and.

437
00:41:58.770 --> 00:41:59.880
Hart Montgomery: A world form.

438
00:42:00.420 --> 00:42:01.410
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Or the.

439
00:42:01.860 --> 00:42:02.610
Hart Montgomery: again.

440
00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:07.410
Hart Montgomery: The global forum so yeah that's fine well they didn't find it they credit other people, but.

441
00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:10.110
Hart Montgomery: yeah I mean the global forums not till September.

442
00:42:11.040 --> 00:42:12.780
Hart Montgomery: Right so like.

443
00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:14.310
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Hopefully, we have a solution.

444
00:42:15.360 --> 00:42:16.740
Hart Montgomery: wrapped up by then yeah.

445
00:42:16.830 --> 00:42:17.100
Right.

446
00:42:18.270 --> 00:42:29.460
Hart Montgomery: No i'm fine like you know good organizations like publicly talk about their security processes what went right what went wrong after things have been fixed right.

447
00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:36.000
Hart Montgomery: Right so i'm totally fine if they go through this, the only people that might be mad or IBM.

448
00:42:38.610 --> 00:42:44.040
Hart Montgomery: Because like it's there, it makes your paper that like had a buck right.

449
00:42:44.520 --> 00:42:44.910
Right.

450
00:42:46.050 --> 00:42:46.680
Hart Montgomery: So.

451
00:42:49.590 --> 00:42:50.760
Hart Montgomery: But yeah I think.

452
00:42:50.970 --> 00:42:53.550
Hart Montgomery: I mean it's fine there's nothing wrong with they want to talk about it.

453
00:42:55.350 --> 00:42:59.700
Cam Parra | kiva.org: yeah it's fine I just I like I worry that it's presented correctly.

454
00:43:00.150 --> 00:43:07.590
Hart Montgomery: Well, if they want to talk about it, why don't you why don't you get involved, like this is a great opportunity for you to get part of the talk to right.

455
00:43:08.970 --> 00:43:10.170
Cam Parra | kiva.org: yeah I don't want to go to Dublin.

456
00:43:14.010 --> 00:43:15.930
Cam Parra | kiva.org: that's really far away and really expensive.

457
00:43:17.700 --> 00:43:17.790
Hart Montgomery: I.

458
00:43:19.020 --> 00:43:23.700
Hart Montgomery: mean you could apply for they're going to be granted there's going to grant money.

459
00:43:25.320 --> 00:43:31.380
Hart Montgomery: Give us a nonprofit so might have you might have a you'll have a certainly a better shot than.

460
00:43:33.180 --> 00:43:34.770
Hart Montgomery: than anyone from companies.

461
00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:36.690
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Oh cool.

462
00:43:37.800 --> 00:43:41.100
Hart Montgomery: So, like I don't know who's going to be in charge of the grant money.

463
00:43:42.600 --> 00:43:43.920
Hart Montgomery: or it's going to make that call.

464
00:43:45.090 --> 00:43:45.540
Hart Montgomery: But.

465
00:43:47.580 --> 00:43:53.370
Hart Montgomery: it's where you mean if you want to, if you want to like do it, you can just say like hey you know.

466
00:43:55.380 --> 00:44:02.910
Hart Montgomery: Like I can't make this without like if I don't get like travel fund, because I work for a nonprofit or something like that.

467
00:44:03.750 --> 00:44:04.140
Right.

468
00:44:07.980 --> 00:44:10.890
Hart Montgomery: Hello kiva has had a presence at the global form before.

469
00:44:11.970 --> 00:44:12.450
Hart Montgomery: So.

470
00:44:13.680 --> 00:44:18.180
Cam Parra | kiva.org: yeah we've been there, we we were there, the last time we had it with.

471
00:44:18.930 --> 00:44:24.330
Nathan George: This year we're what we're facing is that they haven't restored the the postcode travel budget yet so.

472
00:44:25.470 --> 00:44:28.770
Hart Montgomery: yeah I think that's happening like there are a lot of.

473
00:44:30.750 --> 00:44:33.630
Hart Montgomery: There are a lot of companies, even some big companies haven't.

474
00:44:36.180 --> 00:44:49.470
Hart Montgomery: haven't like clear travel or approved travel, you know who knows, with what's happening in China, right now, we could be in for a whole nother wave and like travel could be completely shut down again and go virtual.

475
00:44:53.730 --> 00:44:55.920
Hart Montgomery: So I don't know actually what's going to happen.

476
00:44:56.460 --> 00:44:58.380
Nathan George: For everyone's sake, we hope not, but.

477
00:44:58.680 --> 00:44:59.280
Hart Montgomery: I don't mind.

478
00:44:59.610 --> 00:45:02.790
Nathan George: able to attend virtual events that I couldn't have attended in person, oh.

479
00:45:03.720 --> 00:45:04.710
Cam Parra | kiva.org: yeah that would be nice.

480
00:45:05.010 --> 00:45:06.150
Hart Montgomery: Are you guys going to.

481
00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:08.880
Hart Montgomery: The IWC.

482
00:45:10.050 --> 00:45:16.860
Nathan George: We have one team Member that's going but we're not sending the whole team like we are we're not sending the bulk of the team like we usually do.

483
00:45:17.370 --> 00:45:17.970
gotcha.

484
00:45:25.500 --> 00:45:27.540
Hart Montgomery: need to figure out my registration for that.

485
00:45:29.730 --> 00:45:33.240
Cam Parra | kiva.org: you're pretty close to their don't use so that's not too bad for you.

486
00:45:33.600 --> 00:45:34.260
Hart Montgomery: yeah yeah.

487
00:45:34.680 --> 00:45:40.590
Nathan George: We put a limit on the attendees because of the size or because the restrictions for the venue So hopefully there's still tickets.

488
00:45:41.010 --> 00:45:42.390
Hart Montgomery: were apparently a sponsor.

489
00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:44.550
Nathan George: Call so you've got tickets for your sponsorship.

490
00:45:44.850 --> 00:45:46.830
Hart Montgomery: So, like we should have tickets.

491
00:45:47.130 --> 00:45:47.490
yeah.

492
00:45:51.690 --> 00:45:55.560
Hart Montgomery: So yeah I know it's about maybe a half an hour drive from where I live, so it's not too bad.

493
00:45:56.160 --> 00:46:08.160
Cam Parra | kiva.org: yeah we figured that I figured that I like usually like the crypto stuff is kind of like the least like talked about stuff, and so there was like like didn't have too much to do there.

494
00:46:08.610 --> 00:46:10.260
Hart Montgomery: yeah no it's like.

495
00:46:11.970 --> 00:46:15.270
Hart Montgomery: I don't know I need to show my face of these places and.

496
00:46:16.350 --> 00:46:19.020
Hart Montgomery: If it's boring that i'll just I can just do other work.

497
00:46:19.650 --> 00:46:22.140
Nathan George: Well, you should say hi to Michelle so be there for us.

498
00:46:22.590 --> 00:46:23.370
Hart Montgomery: yeah definitely.

499
00:46:25.500 --> 00:46:25.860
But.

500
00:46:27.570 --> 00:46:32.340
Cam Parra | kiva.org: I think that's all I have for today um yeah unless Nathan, has anything else.

501
00:46:35.280 --> 00:46:45.060
Hart Montgomery: yeah can you should ask if you really want you should ask to see if you can once your travel stuff goes back you should ask to go to actual crypto.

502
00:46:46.260 --> 00:46:46.620
Nathan George: yeah.

503
00:46:47.850 --> 00:46:48.930
Cam Parra | kiva.org: that's an August isn't it.

504
00:46:49.110 --> 00:46:51.570
Nathan George: yeah it's real world crypto it's not.

505
00:46:52.380 --> 00:46:54.900
Hart Montgomery: yeah well the nice thing about.

506
00:46:55.920 --> 00:47:01.230
Hart Montgomery: Real the nice thing about crypto crypto is it's like it's very cheap for a conference.

507
00:47:03.330 --> 00:47:06.630
Hart Montgomery: it's close it's always in Santa Barbara so not too far from you.

508
00:47:09.840 --> 00:47:14.970
Hart Montgomery: And you're like literally living and eating and the uc Santa Barbara doors.

509
00:47:16.560 --> 00:47:18.300
Hart Montgomery: So it's very expensive.

510
00:47:19.590 --> 00:47:20.130
Cam Parra | kiva.org: that's cool.

511
00:47:21.480 --> 00:47:27.210
Cam Parra | kiva.org: yeah I was planning to I haven't talked to Nathan, yet, but I wanted to go to that that's it since it's an August.

512
00:47:27.540 --> 00:47:32.430
Hart Montgomery: it's like the best it's the best place to like actually talk to people were like.

513
00:47:33.480 --> 00:47:44.940
Hart Montgomery: Real world crypto has gotten huge, but you can actually like go like it's very easy to go up and talk to like people you wouldn't necessarily think it would be easy to go up and talk to a crypto.

514
00:47:46.530 --> 00:47:48.270
Hart Montgomery: In some ways approach you.

515
00:47:50.070 --> 00:47:55.620
Cam Parra | kiva.org: There there a it's like a yarn and other people are usually there right like people.

516
00:47:56.100 --> 00:48:00.420
Hart Montgomery: Young is sort of may not so much anymore, in the past, yes, but like.

517
00:48:02.400 --> 00:48:07.470
Hart Montgomery: Like with defeat his jokingly asked me if I wanted to flip a police car before crypto.

518
00:48:10.500 --> 00:48:11.850
Hart Montgomery: Like okay.

519
00:48:14.280 --> 00:48:15.690
Hart Montgomery: You know, like.

520
00:48:16.860 --> 00:48:22.290
Hart Montgomery: But yeah like real world crypto is good it's actually this week in Amsterdam.

521
00:48:24.240 --> 00:48:28.740
Hart Montgomery: I usually try to go when it's in the US, but not usually I don't really make it to Europe.

522
00:48:30.270 --> 00:48:30.720
Hart Montgomery: for that.

523
00:48:30.960 --> 00:48:34.770
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Are they is it going to be there they're gonna have virtual sessions.

524
00:48:35.040 --> 00:48:36.060
Hart Montgomery: I don't know actually.

525
00:48:36.750 --> 00:48:38.310
Hart Montgomery: i've just been super busy.

526
00:48:39.510 --> 00:48:44.040
Cam Parra | kiva.org: yeah this this this like bug stuff has kept me pretty busy Simon can track, a lot of other stuff.

527
00:48:45.150 --> 00:48:56.790
Hart Montgomery: But yeah I mean, I would like yeah just go through, and like I mean if you're like like CCS is a great conference to go to to for applied security for applied crypto and security.

528
00:48:57.990 --> 00:49:00.150
Hart Montgomery: there's a lot of blockchain stuff that CCS.

529
00:49:03.570 --> 00:49:11.550
Hart Montgomery: Financial crypto is a boondoggle or it was a boondoggle but it's actually kind of turned into a legitimate Conference, because there's so much blockchain stuff.

530
00:49:15.090 --> 00:49:17.130
Hart Montgomery: So I don't know if you know about financial crypto.

531
00:49:18.540 --> 00:49:19.050
Cam Parra | kiva.org: I don't.

532
00:49:20.580 --> 00:49:26.070
Hart Montgomery: It is hosted in alternating years in like the Mediterranean or the Caribbean.

533
00:49:27.690 --> 00:49:29.850
Hart Montgomery: Some, like ritzy like.

534
00:49:32.340 --> 00:49:45.240
Hart Montgomery: You know extremely fancy hotel when I was a Grad student 10 years ago it was considered a huge boondoggle, to the point that my advisor who had infinite funding would not.

535
00:49:46.500 --> 00:49:51.510
Hart Montgomery: pay for me to go to financial crypto because he considered it just a waste of time and a vacation.

536
00:49:54.000 --> 00:50:04.650
Hart Montgomery: But lately like it has been getting a lot of actually pretty high quality blockchain papers and it's become a de facto like crypto for blockchain conference.

537
00:50:07.350 --> 00:50:07.830
Hart Montgomery: So.

538
00:50:11.070 --> 00:50:20.430
Hart Montgomery: yeah but but yeah I mean you want when when you have time, you can just like look through this and you can put together a schedule like you know where you want to go who you want to talk to like.

539
00:50:21.900 --> 00:50:24.300
Hart Montgomery: you're in salt lake I guess right.

540
00:50:24.720 --> 00:50:33.330

Hart Montgomery: As a sort of Mike found out.

557
00:51:49.620 --> 00:51:59.430
Hart Montgomery: If you've met someone, and you know someone that you like email them with question about their paper they're like if they know your name and you send an email you're much more likely to get a response.

558
00:52:00.060 --> 00:52:00.660
Right.

559
00:52:03.090 --> 00:52:08.580

Cam Parra | kiva.org: Because I know I there are already people who like i've shared information with like that are like you know people who like we can trust like.

569
00:53:08.100 --> 00:53:22.140
Cam Parra | kiva.org: In the areas community and they've kind of been starting to naysayer about how this is not important, and like how like or dislike you know it's a straw man argument or whatever, and then there, and like so I want to be able to communicate.

570
00:53:22.140 --> 00:53:28.830
Hart Montgomery: Like look if you trust the issue or this isn't a problem, but if you don't it might be so here's the here's the solution right.
