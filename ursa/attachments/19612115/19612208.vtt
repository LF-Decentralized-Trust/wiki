00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.500
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Anything how are you.

2
00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:57.690
Nathan George: Hello.

3
00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:06.030
Nathan George: The areas me just barely wrapped up I don't know if they if anyone announced the ursa meeting in the areas me.

4
00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.100
Cam Parra | kiva.org: On their chat yesterday.

5
00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.930
Nathan George: were the only two in the right spot maybe we're the ones in the wrong spot I don't know.

6
00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.700
Cam Parra | kiva.org: This is the calendar invite.

7
00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:27.660
Cam Parra | kiva.org: zoom link.

8
00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.420
Nathan George: Right in the one on the tasc calendar right.

9
00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.170
Cam Parra | kiva.org: i'm on the calendar of public meetings.

10
00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.690
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): what's up cam what's up what's up man.

11
00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:54.120
Nathan George: hey Sean.

12
00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:56.460
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Sean how are you.

13
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:09.180
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): In the spirit of the phrase identity is hard zoom still has to be logged in as.

14
00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:11.730
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): hyper ledger which is great.

15
00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.560
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): So listen.

16
00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:24.330
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): I don't know if you guys have time at the end of the call I think we're waiting probably like Brent and maybe.

17
00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:36.630
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): hard, but I can show a couple of deck slides about today architecture supporting or so, if you have not already seen them if you have at school without to do it.

18
00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.730
Cam Parra | kiva.org: cool.

19
00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:58.830
Nathan George: Well there's always the case for start on time with wherever you have that way everyone learns to be on time.

20
00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:02.160
Cam Parra | kiva.org: yeah we can do that.

21
00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:05.820
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): weird it almost sounds as if someone has children, yes.

22
00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:13.470
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): Are you guys go ahead and says this is there's a call, I am a guest.

23
00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:17.340
Nathan George: And that that's a nice theory shot, but I don't know that that actually works out that way.

24
00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:21.420
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): As someone who doesn't have kids I just look at all of you and all I did you do that.

25
00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:27.870
Cam Parra | kiva.org: yeah it doesn't work with dogs they keep their own schedule, even if they're later not.

26
00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:29.550
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): cam i've learned that the hard way.

27
00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:34.200
Cam Parra | kiva.org: yeah it's not it they're the they're the boss.

28
00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:36.780
Nathan George: A bit hearts here now, we can get started.

29
00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:40.080
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Excellent cool hey are you.

30
00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:46.350
Cam Parra | kiva.org: I do not have recording privileges to this, so I don't know how to do that.

31
00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.320
Nathan George: it's being recorded, so I think we're in good shape.

32
00:04:50.580 --> 00:05:04.800
Hart Montgomery: The magic number, I think, since everybody on this call can have it 1425361236 Okay, that will let you claim basically any hyper ledger meeting you.

33
00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:08.160
Hart Montgomery: And I do unfortunately have to drop any 30 but.

34
00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:25.800
Cam Parra | kiva.org: cool alright cool well let's get this started real quick um so um our agenda goes this following me share.

35
00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:41.520
Cam Parra | kiva.org: My screen right here um so yeah just for the recording purposes, remember that we have the antitrust policy and keep that.

36
00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:56.220
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Are agenda we don't have any announcements, right now, our pull request on CS select is still up and yeah today, I wanted to discuss certified sets.

37
00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:05.850
Cam Parra | kiva.org: And I think everyone on the call is familiar with them, so I mean let's open up the discussion i'll stop the screen share and open the floor up.

38
00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:09.870
Hart Montgomery: Can you talk more about what you wanted certified sets.

39
00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:17.280
Cam Parra | kiva.org: yeah on application to what we're currently building in areas and.

40
00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:21.210
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Decentralized identity and.

41
00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:31.170
Cam Parra | kiva.org: yeah just like how like have you like what What is your opinion about it, do you think you would work with credentials.

42
00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:41.010
Hart Montgomery: So, so I guess, more specifically, can you say exactly what property you want out of certified sets.

43
00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:45.990
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Well, what we want is to be able to.

44
00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:51.720
Cam Parra | kiva.org: To use it for revocation right and we want to be able to have.

45
00:06:53.400 --> 00:07:03.450
Cam Parra | kiva.org: For us to have a set with revoke credentials and be able to anonymously know if you know the revoke credential is in that set.

46
00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:07.290
Hart Montgomery: Okay, so I give you a credential right.

47
00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:18.330
Hart Montgomery: or give you some some like anonymized version of some masks credential, shall we say right.

48
00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:19.140
Right.

49
00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:24.150
Hart Montgomery: And you want to do a set comparison right.

50
00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:25.800
Hart Montgomery: And then.

51
00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:30.330
Hart Montgomery: magically find out if it's if it's in the set or not right.

52
00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:32.010
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Right.

53
00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:35.310
Hart Montgomery: And do you, what do you need to do this, and like bulker.

54
00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:38.250
Cam Parra | kiva.org: yeah well.

55
00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:49.200
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Well, preferably we want to do this as efficiently and as much as we can, or well I guess the the paper that I sent out that Mike had gave given us said that.

56
00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:52.500
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Basically, every attribute in.

57
00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:57.960
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Have a credential is considered a set so yeah I would have to be done.

58
00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:01.260
Cam Parra | kiva.org: It would have to be done in bulk.

59
00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:04.110
Hart Montgomery: So one of this email from.

60
00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:07.830
Cam Parra | kiva.org: This one this one out on the chat yesterday of.

61
00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:10.260
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Announcements.

62
00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:15.120
Hart Montgomery: Sorry, I missed it on the chat then did you put it on the rocket chat or the discord.

63
00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:16.320
Cam Parra | kiva.org: The discord yeah.

64
00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:18.900
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Great on earth announcements.

65
00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:20.160
Hart Montgomery: yeah sorry about that.

66
00:08:22.410 --> 00:08:30.120
Hart Montgomery: I have like 18 million chat channels like feel free to email is.

67
00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:32.190
Hart Montgomery: This this is mostly on me for.

68
00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:32.640
Not.

69
00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:34.680
Hart Montgomery: Checking the chat.

70
00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:43.590
Hart Montgomery: I don't see it on the chat did you post it on the announcements.

71
00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:44.730
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Announcements yeah.

72
00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:48.390
Hart Montgomery: Okay, oh right, so this is private set intersection.

73
00:08:48.810 --> 00:08:49.200
Right.

74
00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:53.700
Hart Montgomery: So I will say there has been a lot of work done in this since.

75
00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:57.750
Hart Montgomery: Since this paper.

76
00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:07.950
Hart Montgomery: It has become very practical and like big companies do this so.

77
00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:12.210
Hart Montgomery: I know, like.

78
00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:18.420
Hart Montgomery: I think Facebook has an implementation even.

79
00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:31.320
Hart Montgomery: I can ask around but I mean if you like, if you just look at look for private said intersection.

80
00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:35.490
Hart Montgomery: there's a ton of a ton of recent papers.

81
00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:41.880
Cam Parra | kiva.org: cool anything you have a question.

82
00:09:42.570 --> 00:09:46.590
Nathan George: I was just gonna ask heart is there any, are there any papers that have kind of.

83
00:09:47.970 --> 00:09:59.550
Nathan George: got come to the surface, as ones that you think are good ones for us to start with one of the things i've had struggles here is figuring out, you know, following along with the progression of the papers right.

84
00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:01.380
Hart Montgomery: yeah.

85
00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:02.640
Nathan George: But but they're all.

86
00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:09.060
Hart Montgomery: So a couple of my friends actually work actively in this if you are like I can email them.

87
00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:12.690
Hart Montgomery: and ask them like.

88
00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:17.760
Hart Montgomery: You know, basically asked.

89
00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:21.720
Hart Montgomery: What they would recommend.

90
00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:26.370
Hart Montgomery: Does that seem like a reasonable thing.

91
00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:28.170
Nathan George: Not reasonable, but awesome.

92
00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:30.270
Hart Montgomery: Okay yeah I mean i'm.

93
00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:36.180
Hart Montgomery: Sorry, what am I good friends, who was was actually my now friend former intern.

94
00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:43.950
Hart Montgomery: took a job at IBM research and he's done a ton of stuff on this so like maybe we can pull him in.

95
00:10:45.570 --> 00:10:48.600
Hart Montgomery: His, are there any kind of like.

96
00:10:53.460 --> 00:11:02.670
Hart Montgomery: Is there anything outside the realm of normal PSI that you're looking for like is there are there, like scalability issues or.

97
00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:07.440
Hart Montgomery: You know.

98
00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:19.080
Nathan George: Well, my interest is rather selfish, which is the idea of we've got a whole lot of hyper ledger indie networks running around, and if we can combine the idea of threshold signatures with.

99
00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:32.610
Nathan George: With me aggregated signature, they should say with this idea of private said intersection where I could say it here's the corner Mike frost is that quorum President the signatures in the Oracle there's some interesting things that shake out of that.

100
00:11:34.770 --> 00:11:36.840
Hart Montgomery: yeah that's a that's a good.

101
00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:39.300
Hart Montgomery: good idea.

102
00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:46.950
Hart Montgomery: I guess like what scale like what are the what size sets are we talking here.

103
00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:52.710
Hart Montgomery: I guess indie network so they're going to be pretty large right.

104
00:11:54.300 --> 00:12:05.550
Nathan George: yeah but the number of validated nodes may not be tremendous but like what this opens up is the idea that validators aren't necessarily also the signatories to the blocks right um.

105
00:12:05.610 --> 00:12:08.790
Nathan George: yeah you're trying to make it so you're more permission list.

106
00:12:09.570 --> 00:12:11.430
Hart Montgomery: Right right, no, I understand that.

107
00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:15.810
Hart Montgomery: yeah No, this is a really good idea.

108
00:12:18.930 --> 00:12:22.740
Hart Montgomery: And I will ask about this.

109
00:12:24.390 --> 00:12:30.150
Hart Montgomery: Let me write this, so let me write this down on my task sheet sorry.

110
00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:36.600
Cam Parra | kiva.org: yeah one of the questions that I had is how do you stop being malicious.

111
00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:57.600
Cam Parra | kiva.org: let's say like a malicious company who wants to compare who wants you to share your set with their set from asking for too much like they want to know as much as possible, so that you know they could gather as much information about you as possible, how would you stop that.

112
00:12:58.830 --> 00:13:02.370
Hart Montgomery: So they're actually good definitions for this.

113
00:13:03.570 --> 00:13:10.530
Hart Montgomery: So the idea is you, you want to show that, so you have, first of all, you have to have sort of a manual policy for.

114
00:13:11.610 --> 00:13:12.990
Hart Montgomery: for stopping things right.

115
00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:29.250
Hart Montgomery: You, but you sort of have to enforce this yourself right like what queries are you going to answer right or how many queries, but you can show that sort of like.

116
00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:37.170
Hart Montgomery: The learning from queries composes nicely for many of these schemes, if that makes sense.

117
00:13:41.730 --> 00:13:44.130
Hart Montgomery: I don't know if that if that sort of does but.

118
00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:51.510
Hart Montgomery: Like what question so if you're just asking like intersection queries right there's only so much you can learn right.

119
00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:53.250
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Right.

120
00:13:59.970 --> 00:14:04.350
Hart Montgomery: And, and it the sort of like compose gracefully right like.

121
00:14:05.610 --> 00:14:18.750
Hart Montgomery: In good versions of these schemes you don't learn any more than you would from like just the knowledge of like to intersection queries right and these some of these things have what's called simulation security.

122
00:14:19.830 --> 00:14:21.930
Hart Montgomery: Which means, if you like, know the.

123
00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:36.090
Hart Montgomery: If you sort of know the number of the intersections that the adversary, is going to ask you can simulate everything to an adversary, such that it's indistinguishable from the real protocol.

124
00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:42.300
Hart Montgomery: Did that answer your question at all Kim.

125
00:14:44.190 --> 00:14:45.420
Cam Parra | kiva.org: yeah it does.

126
00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:53.160
Nathan George: i'm.

127
00:14:56.460 --> 00:14:57.210
Hart Montgomery: Sorry Nathan.

128
00:14:58.170 --> 00:15:00.660
Nathan George: there's some early stuff we did it.

129
00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:09.600
Nathan George: The sovereign around this idea of public or you need to anchor everything publicly, so that you could resolve.

130
00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:20.100
Nathan George: Everybody could be resolved on an oracle for the key reduction problem um it just it's it struck me as We walked through some of the.

131
00:15:21.270 --> 00:15:30.060
Nathan George: The computation problem that that private said intersection could introduce some of those same issues back into the system, meaning it.

132
00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:46.530
Nathan George: I guess it doesn't because as long as I have uniqueness on each kid doesn't matter per se, but this this construct that i'm computing the full latter joined means that the non correlated to the system can't really be proven on the global scale candidate.

133
00:15:48.150 --> 00:15:50.070
Hart Montgomery: sorry that last slide again.

134
00:15:52.410 --> 00:15:53.010
Nathan George: So.

135
00:15:54.120 --> 00:16:03.390
Nathan George: i'm just i'm trying to get my my arms around how I know that I have not introduced correlation through my private settings section.

136
00:16:04.950 --> 00:16:15.270
Nathan George: or introduced to unintended correlation right because it's basically a homomorphic encryption technique that says, I can prove whether this set or what the intersection is between just said, not set right.

137
00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:21.150
Hart Montgomery: it's not a horrific encryption technique right because homomorphic encryption doesn't reveal anything right.

138
00:16:25.470 --> 00:16:39.660
Hart Montgomery: Does that make sense, so so here you are getting some information about you, if you want to view it as an encryption it's a functional encryption and because you are getting some information about the the underlying plain text right.

139
00:16:40.050 --> 00:16:40.440
Okay.

140
00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:50.790
Hart Montgomery: But, in many cases, you will get like nothing more than like what you would gain from the knowledge of the intersections right.

141
00:16:51.990 --> 00:17:02.430
Nathan George: But the but the computation that doesn't generally in general sense that the intense, to give you back the difference between the sets or the attention just to say.

142
00:17:03.570 --> 00:17:06.390
Nathan George: there's complete overlap or there's not complete overlap.

143
00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:17.970
Hart Montgomery: Will it will usually tell you what that I mean you can have it so that it tells you complete overlap or no overlap, you can also have it tell you the number of things that overlap right.

144
00:17:20.580 --> 00:17:24.690
Hart Montgomery: You can also have variants that like spit out the things that overlap.

145
00:17:28.290 --> 00:17:30.630
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Right there's a way to there's a way to do.

146
00:17:32.310 --> 00:17:32.760
Nathan George: It.

147
00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:34.050
Cam Parra | kiva.org: On this as well right.

148
00:17:34.380 --> 00:17:39.420
Nathan George: It just seems that that detail matters tremendously to some of what we're doing for an identity didn't work.

149
00:17:42.090 --> 00:17:46.020
Hart Montgomery: Yes, but so I guess like this is a well studied topic.

150
00:17:47.070 --> 00:17:49.080
Hart Montgomery: And you can probably have like.

151
00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:54.840
Hart Montgomery: Any PSI variant that you can think of someone who's probably built.

152
00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:01.830
Hart Montgomery: Does that make sense.

153
00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:10.500
Nathan George: yep that's part of what i'm trying to explore and i'm having a hard time finding finding the words to get the pieces i'm looking for.

154
00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:13.320
Hart Montgomery: And, like some of this will be more.

155
00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:19.080
Hart Montgomery: People may have written some of these more in terms of multi party computation.

156
00:18:22.890 --> 00:18:31.590
Hart Montgomery: Because technically private set intersection is just like a very minimalistic if you want it to do more than you know you need more.

157
00:18:33.210 --> 00:18:37.320
Hart Montgomery: You need more power, I guess, like, if you want it to output, the elements in common, or something.

158
00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:42.240
Hart Montgomery: But.

159
00:18:45.090 --> 00:18:52.800
Hart Montgomery: But yes, that this is like this as well study that I can try to I won't make it my homework to find.

160
00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:57.120
Hart Montgomery: To find out.

161
00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:07.860
Hart Montgomery: What sort of what what's a good what's the latest best like intro point to PSI.

162
00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:16.710
Hart Montgomery: And then, like hopefully you know we cannot dive in and figure out what's the sort of best.

163
00:19:17.790 --> 00:19:18.420
Protocol.

164
00:19:22.170 --> 00:19:36.810
Cam Parra | kiva.org: So I have another question wouldn't it wouldn't you also create a correlation problem, because you have to disclose who your certificate authority is, or at least provide a list of your certificate authorities.

165
00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:38.640
Hart Montgomery: to disclose your ca's.

166
00:19:39.270 --> 00:19:47.880
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Well that's what the paper said that you would disclose that you that that your CA was coming from a trusted party.

167
00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:53.790
Nathan George: yeah I think there's a terminology, but we need to map that onto the terminology it's not certificate authority specific.

168
00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:59.670
Cam Parra | kiva.org: right but either way you're signer the the trusted signer right that you're you're.

169
00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:07.800
Cam Parra | kiva.org: In both parties need to know need to know who it is so that they can decide if it's trusted or not.

170
00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:16.950
Nathan George: The Facebook protocol calls this the I.

171
00:20:19.110 --> 00:20:29.250
Nathan George: Did I did this is part of how they're doing a trusted setup so I don't know if the protocol you're describing sounds like a good authority to bypass trusted setup but I don't know.

172
00:20:30.210 --> 00:20:35.640
Hart Montgomery: yeah I mean the I don't the CA is not directly related to private sector section right.

173
00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:47.040
Cam Parra | kiva.org: I thought it was I thought it was at that that was like the whole point was that that your your set is certified by these authorities that you trust.

174
00:20:49.110 --> 00:20:52.590
Hart Montgomery: Well, I mean it could be in your application right but it doesn't.

175
00:20:53.940 --> 00:20:56.400
Hart Montgomery: Like it doesn't necessarily have to be right.

176
00:20:57.690 --> 00:21:03.090
Hart Montgomery: So who like you could, if you if you didn't want to do that right, you could prove the whole thing and zero knowledge.

177
00:21:03.090 --> 00:21:14.130
Hart Montgomery: Right, you can prove that it was certified by some trusted thing and zero knowledge right and then that would sort of not reveal your CA right.

178
00:21:14.370 --> 00:21:14.880
Right.

179
00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:17.070
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Okay, that makes sense.

180
00:21:17.130 --> 00:21:20.490
Hart Montgomery: And if it's only like a single proof than maybe it's not so expensive.

181
00:21:23.790 --> 00:21:26.880
Hart Montgomery: But that's even assuming, you have to use ca's in the first place.

182
00:21:29.070 --> 00:21:30.180
Hart Montgomery: Which is not clear that you do.

183
00:21:32.370 --> 00:21:32.760
Cam Parra | kiva.org: yeah.

184
00:21:33.450 --> 00:21:41.850
Nathan George: Can if you can look at some of the other papers they'll be more explicit about what it is they're setting up and why and how they're guaranteeing the property that sets are comparing.

185
00:21:42.210 --> 00:21:51.510
Nathan George: Comparing to, and I think usually the CA part you fragment is only about i'm going to compare to something, how do I do want to point to the right something yeah.

186
00:21:53.310 --> 00:22:12.930
Cam Parra | kiva.org: that's right right because this paper said that the cia's would would use a cl signature to to to verify to verify the set you know and so that's or, where I was like okay well so like, how do you like you need to know the you know who is cl signature, that is.

187
00:22:12.990 --> 00:22:13.830
Nathan George: In order yeah and that's.

188
00:22:14.730 --> 00:22:19.440
Nathan George: The same problem I get a set to compare against how do I know what's the right set check it signature.

189
00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:20.190
Right.

190
00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:28.140
Hart Montgomery: yeah but I mean you, if you really don't want that you just you can do like a proof of knowledge of a signature right.

191
00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:31.410
Cam Parra | kiva.org: yeah that makes sense.

192
00:22:33.810 --> 00:22:38.160
Nathan George: Which is what that cl signature should have been providing right because it's a sentence or a notch.

193
00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:46.530
Hart Montgomery: Well, it might not be a blind it might.

194
00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:50.070
Hart Montgomery: yeah you might know who the signers though right.

195
00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:56.220
Hart Montgomery: So you might need another layer of zero knowledge to mask the signer right yep.

196
00:22:56.670 --> 00:22:58.980
Nathan George: cases that you can ask the key without.

197
00:22:59.010 --> 00:22:59.910
Nathan George: masking the identifier.

198
00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:00.960
yeah.

199
00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:02.430
So.

200
00:23:05.670 --> 00:23:07.380
Hart Montgomery: yeah but I mean this.

201
00:23:08.490 --> 00:23:14.190
Hart Montgomery: This is definitely doable it's an efficiency question, but I think once the kp for estimator is probably fine.

202
00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:22.500
So.

203
00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:26.280
Hart Montgomery: Does that make sense, Kim.

204
00:23:27.510 --> 00:23:40.020
Cam Parra | kiva.org: yeah it does yeah it does um so would it be really a viable solution for revocation that's like probably like an general very general question, but what something like this.

205
00:23:41.430 --> 00:23:43.650
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Work or yeah.

206
00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:46.470
Hart Montgomery: yeah PSI is very efficient.

207
00:23:48.990 --> 00:23:52.170
Hart Montgomery: So, in terms of like.

208
00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:58.380
Hart Montgomery: If there's anything that's going to work cryptographic Lee like this stands a good chance.

209
00:24:02.310 --> 00:24:06.330
Hart Montgomery: I guess it depends on like what other bells and whistles you need on top of PSI.

210
00:24:09.150 --> 00:24:11.790
Hart Montgomery: But I mean it's certainly worth looking at.

211
00:24:18.510 --> 00:24:19.770
Hart Montgomery: So so yeah.

212
00:24:24.390 --> 00:24:31.590
Hart Montgomery: I mean, I would definitely consider it it's a very practical thing in crypto that's getting a lot of attention so.

213
00:24:35.910 --> 00:24:37.620
Hart Montgomery: Here let's let's do the.

214
00:24:40.380 --> 00:24:41.790
Hart Montgomery: Like if we search.

215
00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:48.240
Hart Montgomery: ACR search sucks.

216
00:24:49.140 --> 00:24:50.490
Cam Parra | kiva.org: But if we search like.

217
00:24:50.610 --> 00:24:52.860
Hart Montgomery: For PSI there are like.

218
00:24:54.480 --> 00:25:03.270
Hart Montgomery: 234-567-8910 they're like close to 20 papers.

219
00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:07.620
Hart Montgomery: On PSI last year arnie print.

220
00:25:14.610 --> 00:25:15.120
Hart Montgomery: Like.

221
00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:18.120
Hart Montgomery: here's a practical paper.

222
00:25:24.810 --> 00:25:29.790
Hart Montgomery: This is, this is not necessarily something you want to read, but i'm just like.

223
00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:32.340
Hart Montgomery: eyeballing stuff right.

224
00:25:33.030 --> 00:25:36.540
Hart Montgomery: right here, they used PSI for covert risks.

225
00:25:38.190 --> 00:25:38.700
Hart Montgomery: Right.

226
00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:45.330
Hart Montgomery: And in fact coven was one of the like this is what people did use for a lot of these like.

227
00:25:47.730 --> 00:25:48.450
Cam Parra | kiva.org: covered.

228
00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:49.590
Hart Montgomery: Protocols right.

229
00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:52.620
Hart Montgomery: So the idea was.

230
00:25:52.950 --> 00:25:53.370
Like.

231
00:25:57.240 --> 00:26:02.160
Hart Montgomery: Like my phone keeps a record of everyone's phone i've been close to right.

232
00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:06.300
Hart Montgomery: and

233
00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:08.850
Hart Montgomery: You know.

234
00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:20.700
Hart Montgomery: Every so often like once a day like I run a PSI on that and, like people in my city, that have tested positive right.

235
00:26:23.730 --> 00:26:28.350
Hart Montgomery: That I know i've had uncovered exposure without revealing potentially who it came from right.

236
00:26:33.810 --> 00:26:34.260
Cam Parra | kiva.org: yeah.

237
00:26:36.030 --> 00:26:36.690
Hart Montgomery: So.

238
00:26:41.010 --> 00:26:45.930
Hart Montgomery: yeah this is this is just one of many ways, people have done this and, like.

239
00:26:51.150 --> 00:26:54.150
Hart Montgomery: So I think it is, I think it is a practical thing.

240
00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:12.960
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Nathan or brand or Sean do you guys have any other questions about this.

241
00:27:14.910 --> 00:27:25.770
Cam Parra | kiva.org: I guess for me i'm more excited to read more of these papers I didn't know they existed I didn't know that it was an active topic so that's really cool to hear that it is.

242
00:27:26.730 --> 00:27:30.150
Cam Parra | kiva.org: The math doesn't seem like it's too hard, like it seems like it's pretty simple.

243
00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:31.680
Hart Montgomery: It is yeah.

244
00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:36.960
Hart Montgomery: Generally, like in these things with the math isn't simple.

245
00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:39.030
Cam Parra | kiva.org: than like the scheme is not efficient.

246
00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:47.070
Hart Montgomery: So yeah It is like relatively.

247
00:27:50.490 --> 00:27:53.280
Hart Montgomery: it's not there, they usually aren't too hard to implement.

248
00:27:58.350 --> 00:28:10.530
Cam Parra | kiva.org: So I guess a big takeaways that we need to be like if this is introduced into ursa or into any other hyper ledger project we just have to be careful with how its implemented.

249
00:28:10.890 --> 00:28:11.190
yep.

250
00:28:15.870 --> 00:28:20.700
Hart Montgomery: We need to make sure we implement security but that's always the case for everything right.

251
00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:21.600
Cam Parra | kiva.org: yeah yeah.

252
00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:23.610
Hart Montgomery: But yeah I suspect.

253
00:28:24.030 --> 00:28:27.600
Cam Parra | kiva.org: It seems like it mostly relies on the protocol than anything.

254
00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:28.590
yeah.

255
00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:36.510
Hart Montgomery: But I mean this is a whole nother layer right, you can get the you can get the math right and still mess up the protocol implementation.

256
00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:40.110
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Right.

257
00:28:42.870 --> 00:28:47.880
Hart Montgomery: Like if you have an API that lets like lets you make like too permissive calls or something right.

258
00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:55.260
Hart Montgomery: You have to be careful with this right, because, as you pointed out, like if you have too many calls, you can learn right.

259
00:28:56.250 --> 00:29:00.120
Hart Montgomery: Right like if I like let you brute force, something great.

260
00:29:01.650 --> 00:29:06.150
Hart Montgomery: like, if I have to, if I have like a universe of all possible sets right.

261
00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:09.120
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Right.

262
00:29:09.270 --> 00:29:09.630
Like.

263
00:29:11.010 --> 00:29:20.130
Hart Montgomery: Are you think about it more concretely like, if I have a list of all possible names that might be in your set that if i'm allowed unlimited queries I can brute force, this right.

264
00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:36.270
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Well, especially in in in verified credentials, you have schemas posted you know have established schema so you know what is in that set that you can ask for.

265
00:29:36.540 --> 00:29:43.440
Hart Montgomery: Right and so, then you know, then you have the protocol, where you have to be careful to restrict queries right.

266
00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:47.070
Hart Montgomery: yeah so like even if your scheme is like.

267
00:29:48.420 --> 00:29:52.470
Hart Montgomery: You know this is a little bit different like you know into like a signature scheme right.

268
00:29:53.430 --> 00:30:07.590
Hart Montgomery: you're not going to break the signal, no one can break the signature scheme by allowing you to you know if I can trick you into signing like tons of messages right well, you have signatures for those but you know i'm not going to be able to forge on something else right.

269
00:30:08.700 --> 00:30:14.760
Hart Montgomery: Here, the risk is that if I let you query to anything's right, then you can just learn the whole set right.

270
00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:18.690
Hart Montgomery: Right, and so you do have to be careful at the protocol there.

271
00:30:24.570 --> 00:30:26.430
Cam Parra | kiva.org: yeah it's really interesting.

272
00:30:26.550 --> 00:30:40.200
Hart Montgomery: So so obviously like if you have to honest no to honest people doing this right, then, then there's no worry, if you have to decide is people doing it, then it doesn't matter either right because they can just directly share their sets anyway.

273
00:30:41.970 --> 00:30:45.150
Hart Montgomery: But the trick is, if you have one honest and one dishonest.

274
00:30:46.380 --> 00:30:53.250
Hart Montgomery: party doing this right what you know, and this is like important at the protocol they're just not not just the PSI later.

275
00:30:56.520 --> 00:30:57.660
Hart Montgomery: Does that make sense.

276
00:30:57.840 --> 00:30:58.620
Cam Parra | kiva.org: yeah it does.

277
00:31:00.090 --> 00:31:03.540
Hart Montgomery: yeah so, unfortunately I have to drop for an 830 call.

278
00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:12.210
Hart Montgomery: But I will follow up on this and I will find like what we should be looking at for PSI.

279
00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:21.210
Hart Montgomery: And if you all have any like other follow up questions or anything for me, for the rest of the meeting, like please feel free to reach out.

280
00:31:25.260 --> 00:31:26.040
Hart Montgomery: That sounds good.

281
00:31:28.020 --> 00:31:31.230
Cam Parra | kiva.org: sounds good thanks for that information looking forward to.

282
00:31:31.410 --> 00:31:34.440
Hart Montgomery: This is a great question i'm excited to talk about this stuff.

283
00:31:35.370 --> 00:31:45.990
Cam Parra | kiva.org: yeah yeah if we get if we get those papers i'll make sure to send them around to and and get people to read them before the meeting and hopefully have you know people who are interested in this.

284
00:31:46.260 --> 00:31:50.880
Hart Montgomery: Well, if we have like five papers, if we have been asked to read them before meeting.

285
00:31:52.410 --> 00:31:56.220
Hart Montgomery: But hopefully will we can at least sort of refine the conversation.

286
00:31:56.580 --> 00:31:57.000
Right.

287
00:31:59.010 --> 00:32:00.120
Cam Parra | kiva.org: All right, thanks heart yeah.

288
00:32:00.150 --> 00:32:08.940
Hart Montgomery: No, thank you all and i'll talk to you later i'll talk to all of you, sooner rather than later and and please like follow up on anything else so.

289
00:32:10.350 --> 00:32:11.760
Hart Montgomery: Thanks a lot cool.

290
00:32:13.230 --> 00:32:14.400
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): i'll see you over there, in a minute heart.

291
00:32:14.550 --> 00:32:15.690
Hart Montgomery: yep gotcha.

292
00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:22.980
Cam Parra | kiva.org: cool so um.

293
00:32:24.300 --> 00:32:43.590
Cam Parra | kiva.org: anyone have any questions or concerns in this topic, I think we have we're probably going to wait on on what heart has to give us and expand from that but um yeah if you have any questions, please invoice them, or else we can have time for Sean to shows.

294
00:32:43.770 --> 00:32:45.330
Cam Parra | kiva.org: His slides that he wanted to.

295
00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:46.110
present.

296
00:32:56.490 --> 00:33:03.930
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): All right, a captive audience, I will keep this super quick, so you guys can get more time back in your day, let me share my screen.

297
00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:06.660
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): Make sure it's the right one.

298
00:33:07.770 --> 00:33:10.350
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): yeah here we go all right um.

299
00:33:12.210 --> 00:33:17.880
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): This all came about because we realized, while we were doing our okay ours for 2022 that.

300
00:33:19.530 --> 00:33:29.580
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): we'd been very reactive not proactive with the Community, and this is our intention with katie architecture for this year and going forward is to be more proactive, to do more outreach to the projects.

301
00:33:30.150 --> 00:33:39.030
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): To talk about what we can do, and the capabilities and contribution efforts that that the Community architecture team can bring but also the help that we need from the individual projects.

302
00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:43.770
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): We have met with at this point, everyone except for sawtooth and.

303
00:33:44.940 --> 00:33:56.790
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): Most of the graduated projects, except for sawtooth and most of the incubator projects are still working down the list, but real quick defining Community architecture it's me David and rye, we are responsible for.

304
00:33:58.200 --> 00:34:04.170
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): working towards fostering a successful collaborative software development ecosystem documented the health of projects and helping projects grow.

305
00:34:05.640 --> 00:34:15.150
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): How do we do that so from a support perspective onboarding awareness marketing contribution, training and certification security audit documentation legal developer engagement.

306
00:34:15.750 --> 00:34:27.510
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): We maintain the chat email list get hub and zoom to YouTube infrastructure which we're working on currently that's not finished, if you like, discord you can thank the both the chat Task Force.

307
00:34:28.650 --> 00:34:39.750
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): At the tlc but also right who's put in the majority of the work game discord up and running for everybody, which has been actually as far as i'm concerned a great ever been super positive.

308
00:34:41.460 --> 00:34:49.380
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): we're also responsible for supporting the tasc and technical contributed meeting so facilitating organizing tasc meetings, and you know just helping to set.

309
00:34:50.880 --> 00:35:05.970
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): The table for successful adoption we engage the Ts who do we engage we engage the tcm needs directors and project health we engage project containers on what they need whether that's issues with github or hey can we create a new channel on discord for something.

310
00:35:07.770 --> 00:35:12.270
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): or hey, how can we reach more contributors, we engage contributed communities to encourage contribution.

311
00:35:12.810 --> 00:35:25.770
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): External communities like historically black colleges and universities nist Internet identity workshop etc, and we are going to start engaging the overall hyper ledger community more this year with research specifically polls and surveys.

312
00:35:26.970 --> 00:35:32.310
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): This isn't meant to be homework but if somebody wants to share their opinion with us, we would love to see it.

313
00:35:33.240 --> 00:35:42.270
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): And then growth this for me is the most important thing that Community architecture should be working on, but growing connecting Community members and attracting contributors.

314
00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:45.180
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): Educating external communities on the mission of hyper ledger.

315
00:35:45.780 --> 00:36:01.200
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): And the individual projects, giving them opportunities to learn and collaborate, we want to build a contributor pipeline, not just hey somebody showed up here's where you can find out more about fabric or indie or areas or ursa but working on building.

316
00:36:02.430 --> 00:36:10.800
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): We had a great effort with events in hack fest pre coated but working on building this idea of a pipeline that we are, we are.

317
00:36:12.330 --> 00:36:15.180
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): Implementing tactics that will attract.

318
00:36:16.380 --> 00:36:25.710
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): contributors to what we're doing not just people who trip across us or who's boss says hey I want you to look at this thing because we're thinking of doing something and self sovereign identity so go see what hyper ledger is up to.

319
00:36:26.790 --> 00:36:36.330
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): We want to be more active in in building a contributor pipeline than reactive, in the sense that oh hey you're here okay here's where you can you know here's a getting started guide or here's a read the docs page.

320
00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:41.520
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): This is something that we are talking about the last bullet growing a maintainer pipeline.

321
00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:50.520
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): But how can we work with projects, both on maintainer best practices Fazio has done a phenomenal job on this, but also i'm.

322
00:36:51.900 --> 00:37:00.990
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): Working with projects on finding the containers and or building, you know we'll talk about building bridges in a second but building bridges with other projects, you know hey.

323
00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:07.290
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): Where the Rojas team, we would love to be doing something with caliber hey we're caliber we'd love to reach out to folks on Monday.

324
00:37:07.770 --> 00:37:15.270
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): So some of that is going to go into maintainer stuff we're still you know, drawing on a napkin with the maintainer pipeline could look like and what we need to do for.

325
00:37:15.780 --> 00:37:22.740
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): How we do it we're going to go into each of these of the SEC we get the word out, so we have amazing projects that need to tell their story.

326
00:37:23.220 --> 00:37:30.360
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): We can signal boost that content with YouTube streams Dev weekly the newsletter the global forum our Twitter linkedin feeds.

327
00:37:31.050 --> 00:37:41.760
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): But we need help from the projects so versus a really small community we get that but you know if we want to highlight when the developers and maintenance on our side, we have developer showcase, which is a section of the blog.

328
00:37:42.180 --> 00:37:48.270
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): We have a new marketing person who's joined the team is going up the profile that brought blog and work with us on getting it to be.

329
00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:56.820
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): Something that's, if not more popular is releasing more great content and getting more interest from the outside hyper ledger community.

330
00:37:57.540 --> 00:38:07.860
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): But we want topical blog posts, we want case studies we want release announcements right now Timo in the areas team is working on a blog post for the areas javascript framework.

331
00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:18.360
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): The caliber team, which is still an incubation is working on their own release announcements because they're going to have a big 1.0 release in April.

332
00:38:18.900 --> 00:38:28.650
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): and, more importantly, you know virtual meetups to announce and share release, so we had some success with webinars and meetups and we want to keep that going, but if there's big news coming out of versa.

333
00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:36.210
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): We want to you know get behind it, both with getting the word out in ways that are searchable and syndicated and shareable.

334
00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:48.390
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): But also, you know, I think, right now, one of the areas workshops, we did in February, the areas workshop we didn't in February has like 800 views on YouTube that's the kind of thing we want to push, but we need your help to do.

335
00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:54.120
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): Most importantly, helping you find a contributor, so we have the mentorship Program.

336
00:38:55.890 --> 00:39:02.910
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): Basically it's an internship program but hyper ledger covers the cost and connects you know projects with a mentor and mentee.

337
00:39:03.750 --> 00:39:13.590
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): In the case of I think caliper they have two projects in the case of a row hot they've got two projects in the mentorship program if ursa doesn't this year that's fine, but we would love it.

338
00:39:14.040 --> 00:39:20.790
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): If you guys can think about this for next year and we're going to gently remind you in Q4 of 2022 so okay Is there something we can do.

339
00:39:21.420 --> 00:39:29.760
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): With mentorship contribution campaigns, this is an innovation challenge i'm sorry contribution campaigns so helping you share, about your project.

340
00:39:30.270 --> 00:39:39.270
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): And how to contribute across all hyper ledger channels, we did, four of them last year, accelerate the move to production and many fabric, we did one around fabric documentation.

341
00:39:41.250 --> 00:39:48.600
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): They were successful, they they actually exceeded all of our benchmarks for what we wanted to do with the contribution campaigns, we did, four of them.

342
00:39:50.130 --> 00:40:01.110
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): And we should have had a line of people at our door, saying hey where's mine where's where's the caliber one where's the ursa one where's the basie one and we didn't and that was partly, we believe, because we're not out there.

343
00:40:01.740 --> 00:40:13.230
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): Promoting internally inside the hyper ledger Community here's something great that we did for areas or four or four ursa and that's part of this effort, right now, this deck in this presentation and getting on your radars.

344
00:40:15.990 --> 00:40:26.280
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): one that does not appear oh okay i'm helping you find to contribute, so we did the hyper ledger challenge which is still ongoing through I believe end of August early September, but this is an innovation challenge.

345
00:40:27.240 --> 00:40:35.700
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): There are i'm going to say 29 projects total that have been proposed that are working on it right now and they're in the ideation and proposal phase.

346
00:40:36.390 --> 00:40:44.190
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): we've done hands on workshops for areas and indie you guys might have heard of that you know the two projects and pretty popular and kind of hot here, I apologize I don't know if you know about.

347
00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:52.800
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): Then academic outreach build your own nfc with hyper ledger fabric, this is something we're doing next week and the following week.

348
00:40:54.270 --> 00:41:01.140
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): But actually no this week and next week i'm sorry no next week or the following week yeah i'm.

349
00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:11.280
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): Working with historically black college university specifically Morgan university to do a two part workshop on fts with hyper ledger fabric.

350
00:41:11.850 --> 00:41:21.480
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): The fun thing about this is the school is putting up an incentive program for the professors to incorporate this content into their classrooms we're going to probably leave the.

351
00:41:21.780 --> 00:41:26.520
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): hyper ledger fabric network, the chain your artist standing up up and running for them to continue working on it.

352
00:41:27.150 --> 00:41:35.880
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): And fts are just hot right now we want to be able to connect with these students are interested in doing this sort of thing but but more importantly we're having big conversations internally right now about.

353
00:41:36.300 --> 00:41:40.860
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): You know let's do this again next year, but make it more technical about supply chain, because we want to reach.

354
00:41:41.250 --> 00:41:51.330
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): That academic audience both the students but also the professors like we we we had some attempts of this a couple years ago we had to put them on hold and now we're getting back into it.

355
00:41:51.720 --> 00:41:58.530
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): and working with Morgan state's been really great and it's got a lot of people, particularly hard thinking about how do we, how do we build an academic program around hyper ledger.

356
00:42:00.360 --> 00:42:07.860
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): One that doesn't appear on this slide i'm sorry about that is season of docs season, the docs is a Google program like season of code.

357
00:42:08.760 --> 00:42:19.890
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): We are working with them on a couple of projects, I believe two or three this year we're going to open this up next year successful to all the projects to propose, and you know get those proposals in.

358
00:42:22.230 --> 00:42:28.620
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): And lastly, listening to you guys, we have Community architects in hyper ledger.org and we have Community that shark attacks on discord.

359
00:42:29.520 --> 00:42:38.550
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): If you need something reach out to us if you have an idea reach out to us if you saw something cool reach out to us, we want to hear from the Community, we will be sending out surveys and polls.

360
00:42:39.810 --> 00:42:44.880
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): You know, one of the things I think you guys have it on cams ever growing to do list.

361
00:42:45.240 --> 00:42:53.190
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): is getting that pinned message in the main, or it's a channel, so if somebody shows up, they can find it we're going to put a welcome message together for every new person discord.

362
00:42:53.520 --> 00:42:58.500
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): So when they join our discord they're going to be, you know instructed hey check out the pin message if you're on a board.

363
00:42:58.860 --> 00:43:11.370
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): That should be directions to find out more about that specific project and how you can get involved, if you want to blame somebody blame Stephen qur'an who did such a great job on the areas, one that we've decided to ask all the projects to do it, can you can blame Stephen.

364
00:43:14.370 --> 00:43:18.240
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): I believe your projects in the wild if you hear something or talk to someone.

365
00:43:19.170 --> 00:43:27.630
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): we're an open source project anybody can pick up the code and run with it, which means we don't always know when someone's picking up the code and running with it, when I joined sorry my dogs isn't it.

366
00:43:28.590 --> 00:43:38.100
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): When we joined hyper ledger when I came back to hyper ledger last December, a friend of mine and salesforce reached out to tell me that they had done a PSC and a pilot I had no idea, so I was super excited to hear that.

367
00:43:39.570 --> 00:43:43.530
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): Most importantly, for me, how can we build bridges between earth and the other projects.

368
00:43:45.420 --> 00:43:55.290
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): Who, who is like your wish list of like hey we would love to talk to X, Y or Z like what's your priority list for working with other projects, what can you bring to other projects, what can they bring to you this also goes to the maintainer.

369
00:43:55.860 --> 00:44:00.270
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): Work you know where can we find maintaining some other projects, who maybe want to be a part of our city.

370
00:44:02.190 --> 00:44:08.310
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): And most importantly, what are the goals objectives for us in 2022 This is something we did not do at the end of last year.

371
00:44:08.640 --> 00:44:18.780
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): we're going to do at the end of this year we're going to every project and we're going to be working with them on what their goals and objectives are for the next year, so we can map the committee architect program to your project.

372
00:44:20.040 --> 00:44:25.230
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): We have some projects that you know if we go back through the the list of stuff that we can do.

373
00:44:26.010 --> 00:44:29.760
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): Some projects aren't ready for a mentorship program or they're not ready for a workshop.

374
00:44:30.150 --> 00:44:36.420
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): But they can absolutely use a contribution campaign because they're ready for that or they're ready to do webinars but they're not ready to do.

375
00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:43.350
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): You know season of docs they don't have their act together with that with this is like kind of a laundry list a menu of all the things that we can do.

376
00:44:44.220 --> 00:44:46.590
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): What we want to do is be a little more prescriptive next year.

377
00:44:47.220 --> 00:45:01.620
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): Also, looking at how we're optimizing things like you know the workshops is four hours way too much, maybe we break it up into two or three sessions, how do we make you know we realized after Indian areas that we should have probably spent more time.

378
00:45:02.910 --> 00:45:10.050
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): Getting the attendees to go to the open office hours within the CEO or would have cut down a lot of early questions and that slowed things down a little bit.

379
00:45:11.460 --> 00:45:11.940
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): So yeah.

380
00:45:13.170 --> 00:45:18.840
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): So listening to you guys and then i've got a bunch of links i'm going to throw them in your discord.

381
00:45:20.550 --> 00:45:29.100
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): Please attend to see meetings, if you can check the agenda is on the wiki it's great to see what the other projects are talking about, but also the direction the organization is going in.

382
00:45:29.640 --> 00:45:37.290
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): And a link to the mentorship program also you guys know Sam current he did a fantastic job in the areas in the indie.

383
00:45:38.910 --> 00:45:44.130
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): workshops around why contribute i've got a link to that YouTube video You can check it out.

384
00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:52.440
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): i'm kind of you know, David price and I are talking about making this just a requirement if you're going to do a workshop that you have something similar to start.

385
00:45:52.920 --> 00:46:00.510
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): it's a great level set, and it was really nice to see somebody layout like here's why you need to be involved here's what you can expect.

386
00:46:01.020 --> 00:46:11.520
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): And here's why you know this is important and it was just a really, really great he ended the areas workshop with it, and then we asked them to do it at the start of the indie workshop is such a good.

387
00:46:12.540 --> 00:46:13.170
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): A good setup.

388
00:46:14.220 --> 00:46:15.060
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): So that was that.

389
00:46:16.170 --> 00:46:20.760
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): Any question well If only you guys knew anything about hyper ledger this would be an easier conversation.

390
00:46:21.840 --> 00:46:23.880
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): All hold hands but yeah.

391
00:46:27.450 --> 00:46:29.400
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): You did okay i'm not good.

392
00:46:29.610 --> 00:46:31.320
Nathan George: We find your ideas intriguing.

393
00:46:31.950 --> 00:46:32.610
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): Thank you.

394
00:46:32.820 --> 00:46:38.940
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): I want, we want to support ursa as much as as much as possible, as much as they are, as a community can take.

395
00:46:39.360 --> 00:46:47.760
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): So I could beg you guys to do a workshop all day long, but if you're not ready for it that's a waste of your time, whereas can we do you know.

396
00:46:48.600 --> 00:46:56.880
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): Pay versus got a new release coming out, can we get some movement behind that we can do that all day long and two things to note with the workshops that we did for hbc us and for.

397
00:46:58.650 --> 00:47:12.540
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): Indian Aries we didn't do a lot of promotion around them and we're talking to caliber right now about doing a webinar to support the caliber released in April, it would be a caliber webinar that we're giving them some of our best practices and one of the things that we looked at.

398
00:47:13.650 --> 00:47:26.430
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): We didn't spend we spent almost no marketing dollars, we spent almost very little time, promoting it, you know the Indian the areas Community got 300 people to sign up and 100 people to show up for for our workshop, which is great well.

399
00:47:26.970 --> 00:47:39.450
Nathan George: Well, with with her, so I think our Community outreach problems are slightly different because we're losing or First, we need to get through the effort to get through project oh so who can get to a graduate state.

400
00:47:39.750 --> 00:47:39.930
Nathan George: But.

401
00:47:40.830 --> 00:47:42.420
Nathan George: there's been a lot of factors to take.

402
00:47:42.600 --> 00:47:53.730
Nathan George: On some of the crypto code of the blockchain community and even though some of it is internal it that hyper ledger a lot of it's also overlapped contributors that are putting code in lots of other places.

403
00:47:54.030 --> 00:48:03.690
Nathan George: So a lot of the Community outreach we need is spearfishing specifically the contributors that are that are defusing that that effort.

404
00:48:04.020 --> 00:48:10.080
Nathan George: And right help helping them buy into the idea that, if we can consolidate we all get.

405
00:48:14.190 --> 00:48:18.960
Nathan George: We get more economy of scale and if we keep moving code from place to place.

406
00:48:19.110 --> 00:48:22.080
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): shark and also, at least in my mind ursa isn't a.

407
00:48:24.360 --> 00:48:32.280
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): vs vs more of an expert level like there isn't a huge audience, whereas there are far more tire kickers and I do have to with fabric.

408
00:48:33.420 --> 00:48:47.670
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): But we want to support both, and so we want to work with you guys on I don't know why my dog Susan apologists we want to work with you guys on both getting the word out, making sure that you know things like the security audit we're keeping that moving forward.

409
00:48:49.140 --> 00:48:55.470
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): Helping you all graduate getting some maintainer diversity like these are the things that wherever we can assist we want to help.

410
00:48:56.250 --> 00:49:01.110
Nathan George: Well, and the other thing that Dave always did for us that maybe maybe we can have some thoughts on is.

411
00:49:01.920 --> 00:49:13.440
Nathan George: Sometimes we don't know who's using our stuff and when they do releases and such like, is a row, has still using ursa and what's the version that they put in their life, they just built, you know those sorts of tracking those sorts of things.

412
00:49:15.030 --> 00:49:17.760
Nathan George: How it helps us a lot in knowing what we need to do to improve the code.

413
00:49:18.150 --> 00:49:20.910
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): i'm talking to all the projects about this, so I can.

414
00:49:21.570 --> 00:49:30.030
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): I can reach out and start asking that question yeah i'd be happy to do it, or if you guys have a sense of at least a starting point of we know X y&z we're using us if you can.

415
00:49:30.510 --> 00:49:46.320
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): throw that to me and discord I can run those down for you and part of this is also there's a slide above like you know we need I made this point to all the projects i've met with fabric, we met with a zoo a bunch of fabric, a row hobbies you got sawtooth on Friday.

416
00:49:49.230 --> 00:50:03.000
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): I made it clear that, like we as hyper ledger don't know, so we need the community's help to let us know when somebody is implementing so if you've got like Oh, I can reach out the real hot team and start talking about that, but I will also bring that up to the others, as I speak to.

417
00:50:07.560 --> 00:50:08.250
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): All right, alright.

418
00:50:08.640 --> 00:50:09.570
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): I took up only.

419
00:50:10.080 --> 00:50:11.460
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): 18 minutes of your time.

420
00:50:14.850 --> 00:50:16.350
Cam Parra | kiva.org: yeah no that was great thanks RON.

421
00:50:16.650 --> 00:50:20.430
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): cool i'll throw the ball throw the deck and the links in your discord after.

422
00:50:21.660 --> 00:50:29.880
Cam Parra | kiva.org: will let you know i'm where I now, we were transitioning from like our old one of our main contributors.

423
00:50:30.330 --> 00:50:44.400
Cam Parra | kiva.org: got a job somewhere else, and we don't have that support anymore and we're still trying to work out like how we restructure in order to maintain or so so we're still figuring stuff out but will slowly let you know of what's needed.

424
00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:51.480
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Go definitely getting other projects on board, since that was the main mission versus definitely will definitely help with it.

425
00:50:54.810 --> 00:50:57.990
Sean Bohan (hyperledger): I happy to help and build those bridges wherever we can.

426
00:51:02.700 --> 00:51:09.570
Cam Parra | kiva.org: cool well if that's it, then I think we can call this meeting, unless anyone has any other questions or suggestions for the next meeting.

427
00:51:10.230 --> 00:51:16.860
Nathan George: Just the last note is remember project report reports um so.
