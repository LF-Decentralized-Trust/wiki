00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.580
Michael Lodder: hey Mr Nathan.

2
00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:49.530
Nathan George: Hello.

3
00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.060
Nathan George: There, how many folks will actually get on the call this this round, but.

4
00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.090
Michael Lodder: And I know i've been super busy and swamped it's been terrible.

5
00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:09.930
Nathan George: Well it's good to be busy as long as it's the right kind of busy.

6
00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.240
Michael Lodder: Lots of work changes so.

7
00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:16.440
um.

8
00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.380
Michael Lodder: I wouldn't necessarily say it's a good thing.

9
00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:21.720
Nathan George: So stuff.

10
00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.270
Michael Lodder: we're.

11
00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:25.650
Michael Lodder: Good though.

12
00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.280
i'm.

13
00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:28.770
Michael Lodder: Sorry, what.

14
00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:30.840
Nathan George: i'm having a lot of those on my side to.

15
00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.200
Michael Lodder: Like with boss changes or with what.

16
00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:45.150
Nathan George: a bunch of different things have to keep keep us decided to wrap up to keep a protocol projects so we're in the process of.

17
00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:52.110
Nathan George: Integrating my team into the marketplace side and taking over some of the initiatives over there and figuring out how will.

18
00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.600
Nathan George: Well what's next for a whole bunch of things that are not self sovereign identity related.

19
00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.840
Michael Lodder: Oh so you're kind of getting out of it a little bit.

20
00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.540
Nathan George: Well, at least in terms of the day, my day job.

21
00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.870
Michael Lodder: I see.

22
00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.620
Michael Lodder: I just finished writing the non credits 2.0 spec so.

23
00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:17.820
Nathan George: Where are you publishing.

24
00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.900
Michael Lodder: A I haven't decided yet.

25
00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.190
Nathan George: Well i'm interested in reading it and trying to figure out, you know what I can do to help.

26
00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:30.870
Michael Lodder: Okay.

27
00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:40.080
Michael Lodder: But I mean I can kind of show you a little bit of what i've got if that's helpful.

28
00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:51.630
Nathan George: Oh, we are officially recording the call, so we should mention that first we just started at nine o'clock we'll do another welcome to folks once we get a couple minutes in, but you can go ahead Mike.

29
00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.250
Michael Lodder: Okay well it's just you and me so.

30
00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.870
Michael Lodder: See.

31
00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.250
Michael Lodder: trying to figure out where to begin.

32
00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:14.460
Nathan George: Now that parts here, we should say.

33
00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:16.350
Nathan George: Remember that this is a hyper ledger.

34
00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:27.210
Nathan George: Community call, and please abide by the code of content conduct and the antitrust policy if you need more information on those you can see them by visiting wiki hyper ledger.org.

35
00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:33.660
Nathan George: And for those who are joining through the recording, this is the hyper ledger or a call that happens every other week.

36
00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:43.170
Nathan George: At this time on Wednesdays in the US and we talked about cryptography and the shared crypto library, that is hyper ledger ursa.

37
00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:54.780
Nathan George: We don't really have a big or fixed agenda today because cam our normal discussion lead is out, so he asked me to make sure that this call still happens, though I did not have the presenter code so.

38
00:04:55.230 --> 00:05:01.380
Nathan George: We can't do anything to change or alter the recording of them to join and leave unless part or someone else wants to take.

39
00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:04.710
Hart Montgomery: Over I believe it is 142536.

40
00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:07.920
Nathan George: And now that's in our recording.

41
00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:12.180
Hart Montgomery: As far as public anyway or semi public.

42
00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:16.470
Michael Lodder: I will just tell you guys know, I have a hard stop at.

43
00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:17.550
Michael Lodder: 930.

44
00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:18.690
Hart Montgomery: might be to actually.

45
00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.950
Nathan George: So so with that we will price this call will end at 930.

46
00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:25.200
Nathan George: At night Mike is.

47
00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:32.340
Nathan George: It has some cool stuff to talk to us about with be a non credit to point O paper and so we're gonna go with that.

48
00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:38.850
Michael Lodder: yeah, this is a my first draft, so he kind heart.

49
00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:47.880
Michael Lodder: But basically i'm just starting with like notation type stuff so anytime you see these calligraphy letters it's.

50
00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:50.850
Hart Montgomery: I know pretty much all.

51
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.210
Hart Montgomery: This all of those mean.

52
00:05:59.370 --> 00:05:59.820
Michael Lodder: So.

53
00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:02.370
Hart Montgomery: How do you put to a okay.

54
00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:06.540
Hart Montgomery: hashing to a prime is.

55
00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:11.010
Hart Montgomery: A little non standard, but whatever.

56
00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:15.900
Michael Lodder: Well it's very for rsc based accumulators.

57
00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:17.790
Hart Montgomery: Understand I understand.

58
00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:22.830
Hart Montgomery: Fine.

59
00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:29.250
Hart Montgomery: it's just not what you've had that how people would usually write that it's all.

60
00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:33.030
Michael Lodder: I couldn't find anything in the literature, so I invented one.

61
00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:38.820
Hart Montgomery: yeah it will it does exist it's just not usually defined as a hash function that's fine.

62
00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:39.600
yeah.

63
00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:45.450
Michael Lodder: So anyway, as far as a.

64
00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:47.940
Michael Lodder: Claims go.

65
00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:58.530
Michael Lodder: Basically, just said that claims are either hashed or their interpreted as a 64 bit number, as is and that's and that's about it so.

66
00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:01.260
Hart Montgomery: 64 bit number six four byte number.

67
00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:10.470
Michael Lodder: Well, no 64 bit number and But then when they're mapped to a scale or you just take it as the bottom value.

68
00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:12.930
Hart Montgomery: it's 64 bits enough.

69
00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:15.510
Michael Lodder: For a steeler.

70
00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:18.420
Michael Lodder: yeah.

71
00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:26.370
Nathan George: But yeah because when we just say if it's bigger than what fits in the integer then we hash it and use that.

72
00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:29.610
Michael Lodder: Now we don't even hash it you just take it as is.

73
00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:33.180
Michael Lodder: So.

74
00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:37.380
Hart Montgomery: Okay.

75
00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:43.110
Nathan George: I was meaning if it's something that's bigger than 64 bits like a string or.

76
00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:49.230
Michael Lodder: yeah yeah i'm talking about numbers like no age or.

77
00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:57.420
Hart Montgomery: Oh sighs I gotcha Okay, so in the I guess you need nothing bigger than okay fine.

78
00:07:58.020 --> 00:07:58.560
Hart Montgomery: yep.

79
00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:04.800
Hart Montgomery: i'm trying i'm trying to come up with something that would be bigger than 64 bits but.

80
00:08:05.490 --> 00:08:15.990
Michael Lodder: No, I mean you can go into crypto currencies hundred or 256 bit numbers but i'm not where the non creds most people aren't doing that so.

81
00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:28.470
Michael Lodder: This is mostly just kind of the data layout of how things would look like optional validators which are just input validators for the claims what what can be blindly signed.

82
00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:33.900
Michael Lodder: The three types a hash a number or just Ross gaylor.

83
00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:36.090
Michael Lodder: that's about it.

84
00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:40.170
Michael Lodder: So this is just kind of the data lay out the data models.

85
00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:53.970
Michael Lodder: This just describes kind of what I call for presentations you have statements and conditions, so the statements are all of the proofs that could appear in a presentation that conditions are.

86
00:08:55.230 --> 00:09:11.940
Michael Lodder: kind of or the combination of statements that will satisfy the proof, so you can think of it as I have 10 statements and then the conditions, say, you must satisfy one or three or one and two or and so on, like that.

87
00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:19.110
Michael Lodder: So it's a combination all thing and oars and not that's about it that's all it does.

88
00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:27.900
Hart Montgomery: To essentially so the statements are like your your base layer and then conditions are just a circuit on like.

89
00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:32.310
Michael Lodder: yep what combination of statements meets the proof.

90
00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:36.780
Hart Montgomery: require handle complicated, can you handle things that are.

91
00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:39.840
Hart Montgomery: boolean formulas.

92
00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:42.660
Michael Lodder: For the statements.

93
00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:46.590
Michael Lodder: knots yeah we can do and or not.

94
00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:53.280
Hart Montgomery: It is your representation, so your representation is binary circuits right, can you handle thresholds.

95
00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:57.090
Michael Lodder: way mean threshold so like for a condition.

96
00:09:57.390 --> 00:09:59.490
Hart Montgomery: Three out of five statements must be true.

97
00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:04.560
Michael Lodder: yeah well that's what that's what you would do with the conditions and say one of these.

98
00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:06.810
Hart Montgomery: So okay so.

99
00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:19.470
Michael Lodder: You can just specify what the conditions, you can say like Okay, I have 10 statement or five statements, so you say one and two and three or one and two and four one and two and five, and so on, so you have quite a few conditions and use pick one.

100
00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:32.040
Hart Montgomery: equipment that doesn't that doesn't scale Okay, so I guess my my main complaint right now is that you should explicitly spell out the languages that the conditions are allowed to take.

101
00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:41.190
Michael Lodder: Well that's partially what this is right so indicates one and two or and so on yeah I guess.

102
00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:43.110
Hart Montgomery: You need to say like.

103
00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:48.870
Hart Montgomery: The conditions are like take the form of a binary circuit or something right with and.

104
00:10:50.130 --> 00:10:55.470
Michael Lodder: yeah I mean it's it's pretty when you say it doesn't scale it's pretty low it's just numbers.

105
00:10:55.530 --> 00:11:01.860
Hart Montgomery: or ids well, but you you just if you don't have like a threshold gate if I asked you to give me like.

106
00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:05.160
Michael Lodder: hey why, why are you thinking of binary circuit.

107
00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:07.170
Michael Lodder: This is not a binary circuit.

108
00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:09.690
Hart Montgomery: Well, you have and or is it not right.

109
00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:14.670
Michael Lodder: For conditions right.

110
00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:19.680
Michael Lodder: Yes, not this is not cryptographic circuits right, this is just.

111
00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:20.430
Hart Montgomery: say.

112
00:11:20.910 --> 00:11:25.650
Michael Lodder: So when we go on it and so like different statements like a Punch and will Sanders signature or a bbs.

113
00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:26.880
Michael Lodder: Plus signature right.

114
00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:27.990
Hart Montgomery: Okay uh huh.

115
00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:29.820
Michael Lodder: These are the types of proofs.

116
00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:32.040
Hart Montgomery: or statements, what about the conditions.

117
00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:40.050
Michael Lodder: yeah so the condition when say you need so say this was one and two and three and four, for example.

118
00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:42.150
Hart Montgomery: Is, which is a binary circuit right.

119
00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:45.420
binary longer.

120
00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:48.150
Hart Montgomery: But.

121
00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:59.040
Hart Montgomery: OK, so I guess what i'm recommending is that you define explicitly what the you just define the condition language structure, whatever more explicitly.

122
00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:00.720
Michael Lodder: Okay.

123
00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:01.830
Hart Montgomery: it's not.

124
00:12:01.890 --> 00:12:05.070
Hart Montgomery: it's not entirely clear to me what you're allowing me to do with this right.

125
00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:19.110
Michael Lodder: Well Okay, so a little more words around that but it's basically you just say and and then each statement has an ID so you'd say and and then all of a statement ids that that that condition requires you can do not you can do or.

126
00:12:19.410 --> 00:12:27.960
Hart Montgomery: The statue and not in orders are like binary are the classical binary circuit representation, Kate so that's why I said that right.

127
00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:28.710
yeah.

128
00:12:30.690 --> 00:12:36.990
Hart Montgomery: So, and it looks like your statements are binary right you're not interpreting them as anything where the true or false right.

129
00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:38.130
Michael Lodder: that's correct.

130
00:12:38.490 --> 00:12:43.500
Hart Montgomery: So this you're exactly doing your conditions are exactly doing a binary circuit right.

131
00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:44.130
Michael Lodder: yep.

132
00:12:44.190 --> 00:12:50.790
Hart Montgomery: Your statements are your input bits and your conditions are taking a circuit of those and checking if they're satisfied right.

133
00:12:51.210 --> 00:12:51.660
Michael Lodder: that's right.

134
00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:56.370
Hart Montgomery: yeah So if you like, if you spell that out, it will be much clear.

135
00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:57.210
Michael Lodder: Okay.

136
00:12:57.450 --> 00:13:00.270
Hart Montgomery: You won't have to have this conversation the next person who comes.

137
00:13:00.270 --> 00:13:10.260
Nathan George: yeah literature normalization we gather the circuits idea is really I think it would help us understand credentials to because there's a lot more momentum behind the crypto circuits, as fellow pencils even.

138
00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:14.130
Hart Montgomery: Though she's not a crypto circuit, this is just a standard.

139
00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:15.240
Michael Lodder: Just binary.

140
00:13:15.510 --> 00:13:17.190
Hart Montgomery: that existed long before.

141
00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:18.900
Hart Montgomery: Up otter in cryptography.

142
00:13:21.450 --> 00:13:29.070
Michael Lodder: Okay, so there's well I say all any and not because all is just and or is any it's just.

143
00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:30.090
Hart Montgomery: yeah so.

144
00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:31.260
Michael Lodder: You know.

145
00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:32.370
Hart Montgomery: And or not.

146
00:13:33.390 --> 00:13:37.530
Michael Lodder: Well, most most non technical people prefer all in any.

147
00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:40.650
Michael Lodder: My marketing perspective that's.

148
00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:42.690
Hart Montgomery: Good to get technical people reading this.

149
00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:45.030
Michael Lodder: Well, it.

150
00:13:46.530 --> 00:13:48.150
Michael Lodder: I think it's fine, to be honest.

151
00:13:49.770 --> 00:13:51.630
Michael Lodder: All in any year also understood.

152
00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:55.230
Michael Lodder: Okay.

153
00:13:56.970 --> 00:13:59.250
Michael Lodder: So I mean this is all that's in a credential.

154
00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:15.540
Michael Lodder: We put in like what schema its associated with the actual signature that represents this what public key can be used to verify it the claims that we're in and we just represent them as Bytes and.

155
00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:28.860
Michael Lodder: there's like flags that we say hey, this is actually printable or not so like say my first name that's principle but, like a binary file that might get signed as a claim is obviously not principal.

156
00:14:30.930 --> 00:14:34.500
Michael Lodder: revocation ideas like there's a revocation identifier.

157
00:14:36.420 --> 00:14:39.030
Michael Lodder: A revocation handle this is since we're using.

158
00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:56.010
Michael Lodder: accumulators, this is your witness we call the handle the revocation value is just the accumulator itself and then, if there is a public key associated with the accumulator that's in there to some like RSA key members don't have a public key but.

159
00:14:57.450 --> 00:15:04.470
Michael Lodder: Finally, in your map ones do and i'm pretty sure that the lattice based ones do, but you can correct me if i'm wrong cart.

160
00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:07.920
Michael Lodder: Do as well.

161
00:15:08.790 --> 00:15:11.400
Hart Montgomery: I didn't even know what the lattice base construction is.

162
00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:13.950
Michael Lodder: I thought that's what you are working on.

163
00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:16.650
Hart Montgomery: Oh, I have, I mean it's like.

164
00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:18.570
Hart Montgomery: So.

165
00:15:20.010 --> 00:15:21.990
Hart Montgomery: I wrote the paper on like.

166
00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:33.600
Hart Montgomery: About like to this sort of well, we tried this it's complicated, I guess, like.

167
00:15:35.670 --> 00:15:41.340
Hart Montgomery: You can do these from very like if you assume fit you can do this, but it's sort of.

168
00:15:42.930 --> 00:15:43.890
Hart Montgomery: It doesn't.

169
00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:47.400
Hart Montgomery: there's nothing remotely efficient anyway so.

170
00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:49.320
Michael Lodder: I see okay.

171
00:15:50.340 --> 00:15:52.590
Michael Lodder: Well then, I just dive into the protocols.

172
00:15:53.910 --> 00:15:57.120
Hart Montgomery: But yeah technically the RSA wants to have public keys.

173
00:15:58.980 --> 00:16:01.470
Michael Lodder: Well, they have public parameters and I usually public keys.

174
00:16:05.370 --> 00:16:06.300
Hart Montgomery: it's a fine line I.

175
00:16:08.430 --> 00:16:09.960
Michael Lodder: mean that's the same thing.

176
00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:15.720
Hart Montgomery: Well, public parameters usually like global that everybody uses in public keys are usually.

177
00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:16.860
Hart Montgomery: Specific user.

178
00:16:17.730 --> 00:16:23.010
Hart Montgomery: So I like pick a modulus that's not going to be necessarily a public parameter right.

179
00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:28.170
Michael Lodder: that's it yeah it's the public key all right, I just don't think of it is that way, but I guess it is.

180
00:16:29.610 --> 00:16:30.150
Michael Lodder: alrighty.

181
00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:38.970
Michael Lodder: So, then, I just described the actual protocols for credential issue with the exact algorithms will check out blow revocation.

182
00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:58.380
Michael Lodder: update and then I just walked through here's all the math for each step for each thing, how to do an ekg how to do commitments so if you want to bind to bulletproof snarks or starks you can do this out of the Vb accumulator works, how the.

183
00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:01.770
Michael Lodder: BF accumulator works.

184
00:17:04.290 --> 00:17:06.540
Michael Lodder: I do el-gamal verifiable and corruption.

185
00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:09.420
Hart Montgomery: And you have a plan to write a security proof for this.

186
00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:13.620
Michael Lodder: Yes, I do so.

187
00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:15.450
Hart Montgomery: How.

188
00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:19.050
Michael Lodder: I once I get it more drafted.

189
00:17:19.230 --> 00:17:20.400
Michael Lodder: than I have but.

190
00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:23.670
Hart Montgomery: More asking about like your framework or like.

191
00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:28.200
Michael Lodder: Oh, I haven't gotten there yet man I got to finalize some stuff first.

192
00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:29.640
Michael Lodder: So.

193
00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:39.390
Michael Lodder: But it's a bit we're being it's one of the reviewers will be analysts sense yeah so.

194
00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:41.190
Hart Montgomery: Yes, so.

195
00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:47.640
Hart Montgomery: Let me show you what people are going crazy about.

196
00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:56.790
How is this.

197
00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:01.260
Hart Montgomery: yeah.

198
00:18:14.670 --> 00:18:16.380
Hart Montgomery: So if you really want to do this right.

199
00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:23.640
Hart Montgomery: You want to write it in a uc style format.

200
00:18:32.910 --> 00:18:35.340
Michael Lodder: Oh okay yeah i've seen this.

201
00:18:39.570 --> 00:18:41.910
Hart Montgomery: So that's like.

202
00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:47.100
Michael Lodder: That.

203
00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:50.040
Hart Montgomery: yeah he will.

204
00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:58.530
Hart Montgomery: So, are you working with him on this.

205
00:19:00.540 --> 00:19:04.620
Michael Lodder: Well, when I presented it to him he's like this is not my area of expertise.

206
00:19:05.670 --> 00:19:08.730
Hart Montgomery: yeah but see like obligated to help you other stuff.

207
00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:11.250
Michael Lodder: yeah more or less.

208
00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:13.800
Hart Montgomery: than you could you should help him like.

209
00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:18.870
Hart Montgomery: he'll probably get excited if you ask him to help you write it in this like framework.

210
00:19:20.970 --> 00:19:25.620
Michael Lodder: Maybe he's he's tied up doing other stuff right now that the company.

211
00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:27.780
Hart Montgomery: Understand but.

212
00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:32.220
Hart Montgomery: This is like a research thing that he cares about.

213
00:19:33.450 --> 00:19:36.480
Michael Lodder: As you see, mm hmm okay.

214
00:19:36.570 --> 00:19:37.590
Hart Montgomery: he's on that paper right.

215
00:19:38.190 --> 00:19:38.460
yeah.

216
00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:40.080
Hart Montgomery: So.

217
00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:42.930
Hart Montgomery: You know.

218
00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:53.400
Hart Montgomery: You might be more willing to help them with like a random question I guess.

219
00:19:54.180 --> 00:20:03.330
Hart Montgomery: yeah but yeah this is this is kind of how you like, because you have like a wildly interactive system right.

220
00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:09.180
Hart Montgomery: And maybe you can't exactly use this framework.

221
00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:15.210
Hart Montgomery: Because like.

222
00:20:17.370 --> 00:20:22.230
Hart Montgomery: Some things are basically impossible to do efficiently in the uc model like commitments.

223
00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.900
Hart Montgomery: And you're you know, certainly implicitly doing commitments so maybe.

224
00:20:29.250 --> 00:20:30.120
Hart Montgomery: Maybe it doesn't work.

225
00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:34.290
Hart Montgomery: But you kind of want to write your definitions in this style.

226
00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:38.610
Michael Lodder: Okay.

227
00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:44.670
Hart Montgomery: in any way right like anonymous credentials have a really, really nice and simple ideal model.

228
00:20:47.070 --> 00:20:55.830
Michael Lodder: yeah well that's partially why i'm also reaching out to and I cuz she said she knows how to do do that very easily and she's done you see before but.

229
00:20:55.980 --> 00:20:57.330
Hart Montgomery: i'm sure she has some point.

230
00:20:57.510 --> 00:20:58.020
Michael Lodder: She has.

231
00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:14.700
Michael Lodder: No, but anyway, the anon credits to covers revocation where you have you can broken broken anytime or you can do revoked based on the timestamp or in times presentable anyway it's got a lot of that in there.

232
00:21:16.530 --> 00:21:16.860
Michael Lodder: So.

233
00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:17.640
yeah.

234
00:21:19.230 --> 00:21:19.620
Hart Montgomery: that's.

235
00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:24.660
Hart Montgomery: That sounds good you've got a lot of a lot of proof reading to do right.

236
00:21:25.950 --> 00:21:27.810
Michael Lodder: yeah don't remind me I know.

237
00:21:29.130 --> 00:21:39.030
Michael Lodder: The thing is, like i'm not inventing any of the primitives so individually, I can just reference those but as a whole yeah there's some work to do.

238
00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:41.400
Hart Montgomery: But you're reinventing the system right.

239
00:21:43.380 --> 00:21:44.430
Michael Lodder: reinventing.

240
00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:45.810
Hart Montgomery: guys you're inventing a system.

241
00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:49.050
Michael Lodder: Yes, yeah that's.

242
00:21:49.650 --> 00:21:50.940
Michael Lodder: The mission and all that stuff.

243
00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:53.400
Hart Montgomery: The primitives may not compose perfectly right.

244
00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:55.290
Michael Lodder: Right.

245
00:21:56.640 --> 00:22:06.480
Michael Lodder: Some of it, some of it run by yon mostly just kind of give it a headline so yeah looks good then like oh Okay, no, I was looking for more than that so.

246
00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:16.650
Hart Montgomery: yeah I mean if you like, if you like, put this together, this is enough for like an academic paper at a security conference, if you have like a proof and an implementation.

247
00:22:18.570 --> 00:22:20.460
Hart Montgomery: So you know.

248
00:22:24.570 --> 00:22:27.750
Hart Montgomery: Like if you submitted to like crypto they might say this, you know.

249
00:22:28.770 --> 00:22:32.850
Hart Montgomery: They might not be as interested, but if you submitted to like us to X or something right.

250
00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:39.630
Hart Montgomery: Then this is like you know, a system that they would appreciate right.

251
00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:42.150
Michael Lodder: Is next are real crypto.

252
00:22:43.380 --> 00:22:51.450
Hart Montgomery: us next for CCS or oakland or your real world crypto too, but that's like not a not technically a conference.

253
00:22:52.890 --> 00:22:55.440
Michael Lodder: Oh that's right because there's no real proceedings.

254
00:22:57.240 --> 00:22:57.690
So.

255
00:22:58.950 --> 00:22:59.520
Michael Lodder: Fair enough.

256
00:23:04.050 --> 00:23:06.300
Hart Montgomery: So anyway, just a thought.

257
00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:09.000
Michael Lodder: Okay.

258
00:23:10.410 --> 00:23:10.710
Hart Montgomery: But.

259
00:23:12.060 --> 00:23:12.480
Hart Montgomery: yeah.

260
00:23:13.890 --> 00:23:18.660
Hart Montgomery: I mean the the coinbase team ought to be able to help you with the proof, but.

261
00:23:21.090 --> 00:23:22.260
Hart Montgomery: If you need it, let me know.

262
00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:23.520
Michael Lodder: hey.

263
00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:30.900
Hart Montgomery: But like obviously they have enough people were like if you have their time you know you certainly don't need me.

264
00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:37.800
Michael Lodder: Well, I mean between us there's only four of them that are actual real researchers.

265
00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:38.790
So.

266
00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:42.570
Michael Lodder: Right now, is all in PC based stuff.

267
00:23:43.290 --> 00:23:44.910
Hart Montgomery: But any of them are capable right.

268
00:23:45.270 --> 00:23:46.710
Hart Montgomery: Oh yeah so.

269
00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:49.110
Hart Montgomery: yeah.

270
00:23:49.170 --> 00:23:49.470
yep.

271
00:23:51.540 --> 00:23:52.860
Hart Montgomery: So, technically, this is an.

272
00:23:52.860 --> 00:23:53.790
Hart Montgomery: mpc right.

273
00:23:55.410 --> 00:23:56.280
Michael Lodder: yeah there's yeah.

274
00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:57.720
Hart Montgomery: For the most part it's pretty thick is.

275
00:23:57.720 --> 00:23:58.440
Michael Lodder: REC.

276
00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:00.900
Michael Lodder: It for the most part it's a two party.

277
00:24:01.020 --> 00:24:01.380
Right.

278
00:24:03.030 --> 00:24:03.570
Hart Montgomery: Lisa.

279
00:24:03.660 --> 00:24:11.100
Hart Montgomery: party well it's a it's a many party right is that the issue you're going to have right is that you have multiple users right.

280
00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:17.010
Hart Montgomery: On your credential system and you need it so that like one user can't.

281
00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:25.260
Hart Montgomery: The activities of one user don't hurt the activities of another user right yes.

282
00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:27.360
Michael Lodder: Okay yeah when you.

283
00:24:27.930 --> 00:24:30.330
Hart Montgomery: This is going to be very tricky for you to define from a.

284
00:24:30.330 --> 00:24:31.710
Hart Montgomery: security perspective right.

285
00:24:31.980 --> 00:24:32.910
Yes.

286
00:24:34.770 --> 00:24:36.000
Hart Montgomery: Because like.

287
00:24:39.330 --> 00:24:43.710
Hart Montgomery: yeah Sam and I have been working a lot on this for the Blind accumulator discussion.

288
00:24:46.410 --> 00:24:47.880
Hart Montgomery: This is extremely tricky.

289
00:24:52.530 --> 00:24:54.960
Hart Montgomery: Particularly when you want anonymity so.

290
00:24:59.850 --> 00:25:01.830
Hart Montgomery: it's led to some like subtle.

291
00:25:03.090 --> 00:25:05.160
Hart Montgomery: We found some subtle mistakes that we made.

292
00:25:06.930 --> 00:25:09.840
Hart Montgomery: Like we wrote the protocol in a way that like.

293
00:25:11.220 --> 00:25:14.160
Hart Montgomery: A clever adversary, can you something to break out an empty.

294
00:25:15.150 --> 00:25:17.430
Hart Montgomery: that's okay well if you reorder this it's fine.

295
00:25:17.460 --> 00:25:21.360
Hart Montgomery: But you know it's not like a major thing, but you know.

296
00:25:24.780 --> 00:25:26.280
Hart Montgomery: Just worth considering so.

297
00:25:27.060 --> 00:25:27.540
yeah.

298
00:25:29.610 --> 00:25:36.060
Michael Lodder: Well, like I said, every time I keep writing it and going through they find little mistakes like from a practical perspective.

299
00:25:36.870 --> 00:25:38.370
Michael Lodder: And like yeah you know.

300
00:25:39.630 --> 00:25:39.960
Hart Montgomery: In the.

301
00:25:40.170 --> 00:25:53.010
Hart Montgomery: point is that if you write things out and these like uc frameworks or uc style protocol, the writing it out is like super time consuming and tedious, but it will force you to catch all of these little mistakes.

302
00:25:55.530 --> 00:25:56.670
Michael Lodder: yeah well.

303
00:25:58.020 --> 00:26:02.430
Michael Lodder: Also coding this you know feeling like Oh, what about this, what about that.

304
00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:07.170
Hart Montgomery: yeah so that's the other great thing about all the juicy stuff is, if you have the description.

305
00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:12.300
Hart Montgomery: It makes it super easy to code because they've they've literally defined all the interfaces.

306
00:26:14.970 --> 00:26:15.600
Michael Lodder: Oh, really.

307
00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:21.480
Hart Montgomery: So, like particularly something like this, where you have a lot of like network communication.

308
00:26:23.730 --> 00:26:33.990
Hart Montgomery: The uc stuff is fantastic because it describes like exactly how you should handle like messages of different types, you know if you need to throw something away, it will tell you right.

309
00:26:37.470 --> 00:26:47.940
Hart Montgomery: And these are like a lot of like border cases where you can get yourself in trouble if you're not you know if you haven't implemented like implementing a complicated crypto paper right.

310
00:26:49.740 --> 00:26:53.220
Michael Lodder: i'll have to take a look at this you see framework more in depth and if that's.

311
00:26:53.250 --> 00:26:53.400
Michael Lodder: The.

312
00:26:53.910 --> 00:26:55.140
Hart Montgomery: Case there's it's.

313
00:26:58.740 --> 00:27:00.930
Hart Montgomery: it's very useful for practical things.

314
00:27:02.730 --> 00:27:06.570
Hart Montgomery: Were there like lots of parties and chaotic systems.

315
00:27:08.790 --> 00:27:11.850
Hart Montgomery: Right or if there has to be like a lot of communication for a protocol.

316
00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:18.780
Hart Montgomery: So it's really commonly used for everything, like everything involved in like.

317
00:27:19.950 --> 00:27:25.230
Hart Montgomery: A distributed key generation, for instance it's like sort of the standard.

318
00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:31.440
Hart Montgomery: You know a lot of npc stuff.

319
00:27:33.090 --> 00:27:37.800
Hart Montgomery: A lot of like long lasting protocols, a lot of blockchain stuff so.

320
00:27:38.940 --> 00:27:42.060
Hart Montgomery: there's probably a softer introduction than the paper, I sent you.

321
00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:50.220
Hart Montgomery: Then, like there's some weird things about the uc framework but uh.

322
00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:55.350
Michael Lodder: Okay.

323
00:27:57.930 --> 00:27:58.710
Michael Lodder: sounds good.

324
00:28:00.900 --> 00:28:16.590
Michael Lodder: And then, as far as the non creds one fixing that proof i've got you know i've gotten one or two of them down but heart when you and I ran over like when over it doesn't seem like it's very really improves the security that much does it.

325
00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:17.970
Hart Montgomery: Sorry, say that again.

326
00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:23.130
Michael Lodder: So you do remember the non credit one proof that is needed to.

327
00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:29.940
Michael Lodder: fix some things right and add the assurance of the issuer's that.

328
00:28:29.940 --> 00:28:30.180
Did.

329
00:28:33.330 --> 00:28:38.640
Michael Lodder: When you and I, through the proofs they didn't seem to really add that much assurance, but maybe i'm wrong.

330
00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:40.770
Hart Montgomery: Well, what do you mean.

331
00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:46.860
Michael Lodder: Well, somewhat they just seemed really like fuzzy on their guarantees.

332
00:28:48.030 --> 00:28:48.780
Hart Montgomery: The proofs.

333
00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:49.320
yeah.

334
00:28:52.530 --> 00:28:56.370
Hart Montgomery: What do you mean by fuzzy I thought they weren't particularly fuzzy but.

335
00:28:58.380 --> 00:28:59.880
Michael Lodder: They didn't seem like they're very.

336
00:29:01.230 --> 00:29:06.750
Michael Lodder: well defined or they're just they were just very messy and I did think like they really did the job.

337
00:29:07.110 --> 00:29:09.210
Hart Montgomery: Oh yeah they're writing style was awful.

338
00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:11.520
Michael Lodder: yeah.

339
00:29:14.370 --> 00:29:16.590
Hart Montgomery: I mean, it was a theory paper.

340
00:29:19.260 --> 00:29:19.590
Hart Montgomery: You know.

341
00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:22.680
Hart Montgomery: There was not a.

342
00:29:27.330 --> 00:29:31.020
Hart Montgomery: It was not a practical paper right they left us out in this era constant.

343
00:29:34.230 --> 00:29:34.620
Hart Montgomery: Right.

344
00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:36.330
Michael Lodder: yeah yep.

345
00:29:37.890 --> 00:29:48.840
Hart Montgomery: Which is like fine technically technically they didn't say anything correct, but like you know someone's just going to implement that with constant sound as air.

346
00:29:50.820 --> 00:29:51.210
Michael Lodder: yeah.

347
00:29:51.690 --> 00:29:52.080
So.

348
00:29:55.890 --> 00:29:57.660
Michael Lodder: Actually, the easiest thing that we didn't.

349
00:29:57.660 --> 00:30:00.990
Michael Lodder: understand and then checking correct.

350
00:30:01.170 --> 00:30:03.000
Hart Montgomery: It was a nightmare if you're.

351
00:30:04.050 --> 00:30:06.540
Hart Montgomery: If you're mostly involved in implementation work.

352
00:30:06.930 --> 00:30:08.760
Hart Montgomery: yep yeah it was terrible.

353
00:30:09.270 --> 00:30:13.590
Michael Lodder: yeah so like I said i've got about two of them done, but not all four of them.

354
00:30:14.670 --> 00:30:14.970
Oh.

355
00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:18.000
Michael Lodder: it's it's a nightmare.

356
00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:24.540
Michael Lodder: So, because there's two of those proofs that you have to generate they're just super large.

357
00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:26.340
Hart Montgomery: yeah yeah.

358
00:30:28.290 --> 00:30:28.620
Michael Lodder: it's not.

359
00:30:28.950 --> 00:30:37.590
Hart Montgomery: Another great will like you should give a real world crypto talk about all of the like bad things you found it for many papers.

360
00:30:40.410 --> 00:30:50.310
Michael Lodder: yeah I could maybe they'll finally get the author's attention on some of these because some of them are like tell the author hey you're missing this information or that I don't hear back.

361
00:30:50.970 --> 00:30:56.070
Hart Montgomery: And I would be careful about explicitly calling people out, but if you do it like anonymously.

362
00:30:57.420 --> 00:30:57.900
Hart Montgomery: The.

363
00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:02.040
Michael Lodder: Just the i'm emailing them directly, I wouldn't do that at the conference.

364
00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:07.230
Hart Montgomery: Oh yeah but I mean you can say at the conference that like you know, the majority of people right.

365
00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:14.250
Hart Montgomery: You know didn't respond or something right.

366
00:31:15.990 --> 00:31:16.530
Michael Lodder: yeah.

367
00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:18.540
Hart Montgomery: So.

368
00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:21.720
Hart Montgomery: yeah.

369
00:31:23.220 --> 00:31:23.730
Hart Montgomery: anyway.

370
00:31:24.390 --> 00:31:39.090
Michael Lodder: yeah well like I said I wrote a blog once and then, finally, one of the author said oh that was just some little thing that we just assumed everybody knew blah blah blah, but I guess, we should address that and then they still haven't.

371
00:31:40.350 --> 00:31:42.420
Michael Lodder: So it's I don't know.

372
00:31:43.890 --> 00:31:46.260
Michael Lodder: it's kind of the one of the big frustrations as an implementing.

373
00:31:46.980 --> 00:31:47.340
Hart Montgomery: got.

374
00:31:47.430 --> 00:31:48.240
Their attention.

375
00:31:49.710 --> 00:31:54.060
Michael Lodder: it's on their radar as far as I can tell it's just i'm not they're all about publishing papers.

376
00:31:54.090 --> 00:31:56.940
Hart Montgomery: yeah they're researchers, they get graded on whether they publish right.

377
00:31:57.900 --> 00:31:59.430
Hart Montgomery: it's mostly like.

378
00:32:01.980 --> 00:32:17.430
Hart Montgomery: But conferences are they getting their papers into right and how much interest or their papers getting right so there's a lot of like gaming trying to essentially just game, the system right and just get papers into conferences and it doesn't matter what like nothing else matters.

379
00:32:19.260 --> 00:32:19.650
Hart Montgomery: So.

380
00:32:21.420 --> 00:32:25.770
Hart Montgomery: If you talk to a long time academics they'll get pretty fired up about this.

381
00:32:27.390 --> 00:32:27.870
Hart Montgomery: Like.

382
00:32:27.930 --> 00:32:31.050
Hart Montgomery: The PCs are failing the Community kind of talk, but.

383
00:32:35.940 --> 00:32:38.520
Hart Montgomery: You know, like, why are all these papers, you know.

384
00:32:39.630 --> 00:32:41.010
Hart Montgomery: So anyway.

385
00:32:42.750 --> 00:32:46.380
Hart Montgomery: But yeah it's a it's a legit problem, but I mean if you like.

386
00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:49.290
Hart Montgomery: yeah.

387
00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:55.110
Hart Montgomery: On the other hand, these ucs papers is great for implementation so.

388
00:32:56.100 --> 00:32:56.460
Okay.

389
00:32:57.630 --> 00:33:03.780
Michael Lodder: Well, thanks guys I gotta run, believe it or not, i'm getting roped into teaching a course this fall.

390
00:33:05.220 --> 00:33:06.810
Michael Lodder: it's called technical privacy.

391
00:33:07.860 --> 00:33:12.600
Michael Lodder: excited though it's it's more of like you know because everybody has governance.

392
00:33:14.010 --> 00:33:20.460
Michael Lodder: risk and compliance so everybody can do it all, in theory, but how do you actually technically do this type of stuff.

393
00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:22.050
Michael Lodder: So.

394
00:33:22.890 --> 00:33:23.280
they're.

395
00:33:25.230 --> 00:33:33.600
Michael Lodder: At the same university i'm finishing my PhD they want it, they they said hey we really want to because I when I did my dissertation proposal.

396
00:33:35.010 --> 00:33:39.300
Michael Lodder: They said hey This is great to we teach a course on this stuff and I said sure.

397
00:33:40.830 --> 00:33:51.300
Michael Lodder: here's how I would teach it they're like okay great now I didn't hear anything until like a week ago, and then and we got this approved by the Board of regents could you teach it this fall wait what.

398
00:33:52.470 --> 00:33:57.690
Michael Lodder: So we'll see how this goes, so I actually have to go meet with the border regions, right now, so.

399
00:33:58.440 --> 00:33:59.880
Hart Montgomery: All right, all right.

400
00:34:00.930 --> 00:34:02.700
Hart Montgomery: Talk to you later thanks so high.

401
00:34:03.300 --> 00:34:06.930
Michael Lodder: yeah so don't don't propose something I guess unless you actually want to do it.

402
00:34:10.170 --> 00:34:11.610
Michael Lodder: So alrighty.

403
00:34:12.300 --> 00:34:14.130
Hart Montgomery: email me if you need any help with that stuff.

404
00:34:14.520 --> 00:34:15.810
Michael Lodder: Okay sounds good, I.

405
00:34:15.810 --> 00:34:18.120
Hart Montgomery: should have plenty of people to help with.

406
00:34:18.420 --> 00:34:18.930
Michael Lodder: Oh yeah.

407
00:34:19.170 --> 00:34:23.040
Michael Lodder: yeah there's no shortage there, so I should be fine i'll let you know.

408
00:34:23.370 --> 00:34:26.250
Hart Montgomery: Alright, so have like the bye bye.

409
00:34:29.250 --> 00:34:39.120
Nathan George: And with that we are going to wrap up our meeting for this week we hope you can join us here in two weeks, and hopefully this recording makes it to where it needs to go, so thank you very much.
