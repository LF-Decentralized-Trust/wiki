00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:21.060
Nathan George: hello, I can report to the areas call just wrapped up, but also the reminders that I w is going on right now, so I don't know what our attendance will be like.

2
00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:23.160
Nathan George: anything.

3
00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.950
Camilo Parra: um yeah i'm just I think heart, said that he would be here and so as Mike.

4
00:04:59.340 --> 00:04:59.790
Michael Lodder: Hello.

5
00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:02.850
Nathan George: Hello.

6
00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:05.220
Michael Lodder: hey there.

7
00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:12.360
Nathan George: I think everyone's just kind of waiting to see if we get any more stragglers show up.

8
00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:16.890
Nathan George: we're hoping heart joins right.

9
00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:19.800
Michael Lodder: He won't he's an idea w SOS brand.

10
00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:26.610
Camilo Parra: yeah I thought hard, said that he was going to join today either way.

11
00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:31.680
Michael Lodder: Oh well, i'm not quite done yet.

12
00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:38.490
Michael Lodder: But this proof is incredibly huge.

13
00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:41.400
Nathan George: Ah.

14
00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:51.420
Michael Lodder: I mean it's it's a nightmare so i'm I can maybe we should discuss the ramifications of this.

15
00:05:55.590 --> 00:06:09.330
Camilo Parra: yeah that'd be good so Nathan um so with me and Mike kind of discussed offline this but um yeah the the size of this proof would mean that it wouldn't be able to fit into a normal credit def.

16
00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:13.470
Michael Lodder: Let me, let me show you what I mean.

17
00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:24.870
Michael Lodder: i'll try i'll try to just skip them like too much of the math but just know how many how many it is so after doing a deep dive of this.

18
00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:34.110
Michael Lodder: So there are two possible proofs one, is where the rsc modulus is secret, the other is where it is known, so initially I went down this path.

19
00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:46.110
Michael Lodder: And this parts, the same in both this part some similar to both but then this is what's different between the two Okay, when you go look at this paper.

20
00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:49.140
Michael Lodder: And I confirmed it with heart.

21
00:06:51.300 --> 00:07:05.760
Michael Lodder: The security guarantees are actually really crappy like really, really bad so it's not even worth doing it doesn't save you anything either, so the simpler protocol is actually this one.

22
00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:10.440
Michael Lodder: But here's here's where the proof gets nasty okay.

23
00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:19.860
Michael Lodder: In order to check that your RSA modules and, in our case, which is 2048 bits or two kilobits right.

24
00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:41.190
Michael Lodder: You have to generate and operate in something bigger than that which is this prime order queue so the smallest that I could go was three kilobits for this, which means every operation that you see down below is going to be in MOD Q.

25
00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:47.580
Michael Lodder: So, or three kilobits Okay, so if you come down here.

26
00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:55.680
Michael Lodder: here's one of them there's 12345.

27
00:07:56.850 --> 00:08:28.140
Michael Lodder: And then each of these represents ashore proof of that same size, so now we're up to 56789 and then it says, you have to do this so here's 10 1112 1314 1516 Okay, and then a sharper for each of these so that's 818 1920 2122 2320 420-526-2728 and then you have to run this.

28
00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:37.260
Michael Lodder: TEE times so in our case, since 48 That means that you have to run this 112 times.

29
00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:47.790
Michael Lodder: times for okay so we're up to about 30 right here, right 30 times three kilobits now this four times.

30
00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:51.060
Michael Lodder: So look what look at the size of this proof.

31
00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:54.600
Michael Lodder: Here we go again.

32
00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:59.580
Michael Lodder: This which is 248.

33
00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:03.840
Nathan George: To 50, such as the short are talking about a couple bag.

34
00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:08.070
Michael Lodder: it's its massive so you have 30 times.

35
00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:28.470
Michael Lodder: 384 which is 11 kilobytes and then this are so you have to pick 112 of these other 112 of these hundred and 12 of these which yields hundred and 12 and Z Q, which is 380 412 of these.

36
00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:30.600
Nathan George: All of those right yeah.

37
00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:31.650
Nathan George: Well, this is.

38
00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:32.490
Michael Lodder: All this.

39
00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:43.260
Nathan George: If it only has to be done once with a trusted authority probably not that big of deal if you have to do it every time a credential is issued, it starts to be a lot.

40
00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:57.000
Michael Lodder: No, I wouldn't say you have to do it every time a credential is issued, I would say, every time you, you are each time you like what's a way to describe it like you certify an issuer right.

41
00:09:58.050 --> 00:10:03.960
Michael Lodder: So maybe it's just the first time you get a credential from this public key.

42
00:10:06.270 --> 00:10:15.390
Camilo Parra: yeah and I think I don't think that would be a problem, I think it like we found out a sovereign was that people will rarely right pred depths to the ledger.

43
00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:38.730
Michael Lodder: yeah well i'm just telling you the size of this thing right before even running this four times i'm already up 12 kilobytes and now i've got to do this so 112 times to 56 times two that's 58 kilobytes plus the 12 I already had so now you're up to 80 kilobytes.

44
00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:58.590
Michael Lodder: And now you've got to do 112 of these that's 384 times 112 that's another 43 kilobytes so now you're up to 112 kilobytes or 120 23 and then all this stuff.

45
00:10:59.730 --> 00:11:09.360
Michael Lodder: So times to whoops so three four times to 24 year up to 86 plus 86 so I mean you're.

46
00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:17.790
Michael Lodder: By the time you're done you're at half a megabyte for this whole thing which is way too big to put on the ledger.

47
00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:22.170
Michael Lodder: Did you have to do this, four times.

48
00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:31.650
Michael Lodder: So.

49
00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:32.670
Michael Lodder: Actually yeah.

50
00:11:32.730 --> 00:11:38.760
Michael Lodder: So you're up you're up to 100 you're up to five about half a megabyte for this proof.

51
00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:43.110
Michael Lodder: So it's quite nasty.

52
00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:50.820
Michael Lodder: And I know sovereign that's bigger than the indie transaction limit.

53
00:11:52.290 --> 00:11:57.930
Michael Lodder: So the only way that you would store this on the ledger in my mind is to hash the proof.

54
00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:04.650
Michael Lodder: and have an address for it off chain like I pfs or something like that.

55
00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:17.160
Michael Lodder: So if you did it when you started off chain and I pfs, then you only have to store the hash on chain much because then the hash also functions as the address, and you have to do a double lookup.

56
00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:20.520
Michael Lodder: So.

57
00:12:22.170 --> 00:12:38.940
Michael Lodder: that's where it's at, but it is nasty the other one doesn't save you much in is actually has weaker security and then, if we up the cl signatures to be 128 bit versus 112 bit you're almost to a megabyte in size.

58
00:12:40.050 --> 00:12:44.970
Michael Lodder: In fact, you are over a megabyte in size, because remember that Q has to be bigger than the other one.

59
00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:51.450
Nathan George: Well, the megabyte itself doesn't concern me so much as how often do we have to transmit sick right right.

60
00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:54.210
Michael Lodder: Well yeah.

61
00:12:56.310 --> 00:13:02.580
Michael Lodder: My, mind you just do it whenever your youth, this is a brand new public key that you've never seen before.

62
00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:18.000
Camilo Parra: yeah and i'm not too concerned about how it will be implemented, I think, like the way will be implemented, would be like like Mike said, like something like a tail server or.

63
00:13:18.390 --> 00:13:20.190
Camilo Parra: You know you'd call this, whatever your.

64
00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:22.260
Camilo Parra: I guess your.

65
00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:27.330
Camilo Parra: security check server whatever you want to call it, and.

66
00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:30.780
Camilo Parra: yeah just be a new.

67
00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:35.400
Camilo Parra: A new thing that would accompany the indie ledger.

68
00:13:37.170 --> 00:13:44.310
Camilo Parra: And it wouldn't be that big of a you know wouldn't be costly to anybody because it just be a few Meg.

69
00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:45.270
Nathan George: Well, I played it.

70
00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:48.720
Camilo Parra: yeah go ahead and ethan.

71
00:13:50.340 --> 00:14:06.810
Nathan George: there's a few different aspects to talk about this with one is OK mechanically, how do we capture and distribute the bites right there that's where I think, can you just directly jumps to the second is what the perception danger of making it seem like the setup process is very expensive.

72
00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:08.700
Nathan George: Then.

73
00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:18.870
Nathan George: The third, the third one is is this check sufficient is there, another alternative check, we should be investigating and I think for the earth to call the third discussions, the one that's the most interesting.

74
00:14:20.370 --> 00:14:29.280
Nathan George: In terms of being able to capture the data, whether it's big or small, I think the rest of the community's gonna say go give me what I need to make the proof and then we'll decide how often and where to store it.

75
00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:51.960
Camilo Parra: Right and will, I think that there isn't a a simpler solution for cl signatures, I think the question is, do we want to can do you want to move forward with with recommending cl signatures and supporting sealed signatures if it's going to bring you know all this extra baggage with it.

76
00:14:57.360 --> 00:15:04.560
Nathan George: Well, I think all of us are of the opinion that, if we can get to the kp predicate proof some other way, we were happy to move.

77
00:15:05.130 --> 00:15:14.430
Nathan George: forward that that progress is progress right, so I don't I don't think that's that's I don't have any rebuttal for that, nor do I think we need to have are both for that.

78
00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:21.150
Nathan George: The question I was trying to ask Mike Is there something else we should be investigating before we move forward with just kind of you know.

79
00:15:22.410 --> 00:15:23.910
Nathan George: Putting a bandaid on it and.

80
00:15:25.470 --> 00:15:26.700
Nathan George: And figuring out what's next.

81
00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:30.900
Michael Lodder: well.

82
00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:38.670
Michael Lodder: I haven't given that much thought.

83
00:15:39.780 --> 00:15:41.970
Michael Lodder: Because this proof stuff is quite old.

84
00:15:49.650 --> 00:15:54.900
Michael Lodder: I mean, maybe there's some maybe we could reduce some of the proof stuff like.

85
00:15:56.790 --> 00:16:06.840
Michael Lodder: You could do a square free proof, which is substantially smaller and some of the other proofs to maybe just enhance the security without doing this whole thing.

86
00:16:11.850 --> 00:16:15.060
Michael Lodder: I mean there's there's like four different things you could do.

87
00:16:16.170 --> 00:16:20.790
Michael Lodder: I mean, this is probably why young Commission the first place just to just abandon to this.

88
00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:23.040
Michael Lodder: Proof all together right.

89
00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:26.640
Michael Lodder: That makes sense.

90
00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:29.970
Michael Lodder: I.

91
00:16:30.870 --> 00:16:34.260
Michael Lodder: mean it just depends what's the risk we're willing to take here.

92
00:16:34.410 --> 00:16:42.960
Nathan George: So I remember conversations about whether we these checks were worthwhile or not occurring really early on, because probably.

93
00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:50.790
Nathan George: Oh gosh That was a long time ago, but I don't remember what the conclusions of those discussions, where.

94
00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:53.520
Nathan George: If someone is here.

95
00:16:54.630 --> 00:17:03.900
Nathan George: If someone has a direct line to heart, we might want to ask heart to go bother Jason because Jason is there a w two and a Jason might remember more.

96
00:17:06.270 --> 00:17:14.940
Michael Lodder: Well, so there's like two other proofs that I think we could add that they're pretty decent one is called square free.

97
00:17:17.490 --> 00:17:20.430
Michael Lodder: What that means is it proves that the.

98
00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:30.240
Michael Lodder: what's the best way to describe this is a hard time this morning it's too early.

99
00:17:32.790 --> 00:17:41.550
Michael Lodder: it's basically saying that, like the the two prime numbers are not equal to each other, so it doesn't produce a squared number a squared product.

100
00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:54.750
Michael Lodder: So that's one thing and then the other is what's called a destroyer prime product, which means they have no odd common factors.

101
00:17:57.150 --> 00:17:57.810
Michael Lodder: So.

102
00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:10.350
Michael Lodder: that's so that kind of like I said Those are two relatively small proofs that you could add to it that maybe enhance that does enhance maybe the.

103
00:18:12.690 --> 00:18:13.860
Michael Lodder: The guarantees.

104
00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:24.390
Michael Lodder: But i'm not entirely sure well The thing is, in the original ID mix paper this proof is completely left out right.

105
00:18:26.190 --> 00:18:26.670
Camilo Parra: Right.

106
00:18:27.810 --> 00:18:36.330
Michael Lodder: Probably intentionally for this very reason, the other two that you that are problematic is it was called the prime power product.

107
00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:53.040
Michael Lodder: This is, and this is the one that doesn't give you very much, security that when the heart and I investigated right you basically have to prove that the modulus can't be divided by any prime factors.

108
00:18:54.840 --> 00:19:03.180
Michael Lodder: So that's that's the other one, and then the other one is that the set of the two PRIMES that make up the modulus.

109
00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:16.530
Michael Lodder: it's another huge proof and it proves that they are distinct and they're not can grow into certain factors which makes them safe they're not small so.

110
00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:34.170
Camilo Parra: Right I just don't see how they are would be I guess like I haven't looked to the proofs that you're mentioning but I don't see like how it would be easy, how it could be done, you know, safer and you an easier way.

111
00:19:36.210 --> 00:19:38.790
Michael Lodder: I I don't know like.

112
00:19:39.510 --> 00:19:45.930
Michael Lodder: When i've done threshold signing algorithms where they use pyre encryption, where we have the similar.

113
00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:49.350
Michael Lodder: problem here, where you have to do a product of two PRIMES right.

114
00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:54.780
Michael Lodder: They the only proof that they do is proof of square free.

115
00:19:55.950 --> 00:19:58.230
Michael Lodder: that's literally, the only profile ever see them do.

116
00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:05.370
Michael Lodder: which basically means the two PRIMES are not equal to each other.

117
00:20:06.570 --> 00:20:10.980
Michael Lodder: Among and they're big enough that's pretty much all day guarantee with that point.

118
00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:17.280
Michael Lodder: i'm trying to remember how big that one is.

119
00:20:19.410 --> 00:20:27.030
Camilo Parra: yeah and that and that one doesn't it doesn't solve the problem of what of what these a of this vulnerability is reporting because they're saying.

120
00:20:27.870 --> 00:20:48.270
Camilo Parra: You know I can get away with a pseudo or like a pseudo or unsafe prime I guess or an unsafe prime and it's not going to be one of them, you know could pass off, but the other one couldn't and so you I guess you could fake you can fake that you know that that wouldn't.

121
00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:52.920
Camilo Parra: Your the square free proof wouldn't wouldn't be able to capture that.

122
00:20:54.180 --> 00:21:01.020
Michael Lodder: Well, what the square pre proof does is it proves that the parameters were created honestly right.

123
00:21:01.590 --> 00:21:02.070
Camilo Parra: mm hmm.

124
00:21:05.610 --> 00:21:16.650
Michael Lodder: So it's still fairly large, but then, like you, all i'm saying is you could just replace the I wonder if you could just replace it with that instead.

125
00:21:20.490 --> 00:21:23.970
Camilo Parra: And I can do the research on that, like that that's not a problem.

126
00:21:26.220 --> 00:21:29.520
Michael Lodder: Let me know your time is limited Mike so so.

127
00:21:30.090 --> 00:21:32.280
Camilo Parra: So we could do the we could do the.

128
00:21:32.310 --> 00:21:39.930
Michael Lodder: Whole here's the paper that has that has that proof like i've already i've already implemented this not for sale signatures, but for other stuff.

129
00:21:41.550 --> 00:21:46.890
Michael Lodder: Those are the two papers have the proof of square free and the guarantees that they provide i'm wondering if that would be good enough.

130
00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:55.140
Michael Lodder: Art will probably disagree and say well depends on what guarantees you want, you know, this is where he's going to say, if you want to.

131
00:21:55.230 --> 00:21:59.220
Michael Lodder: guarantee everything, then you should do this massive proof.

132
00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:10.800
Michael Lodder: But if you are acceptable if it's acceptable to not be quite a secure, maybe we do the current sorry proof of correctness setup plus the square free proof and call it good.

133
00:22:16.380 --> 00:22:18.450
Camilo Parra: yeah I don't know what do you think Nathan.

134
00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:24.120
Nathan George: well.

135
00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:37.290
Nathan George: part of what we're after is a rebuttal to the security paper and we understand the the security vulnerability is very limited in scope and i'm Okay, if the fix is limited in scope.

136
00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:45.150
Nathan George: Now it feels like the right due diligence, to see if one of these other techniques works in a way that's a little bit better.

137
00:22:46.410 --> 00:22:57.420
Nathan George: But you know I don't really have the wherewithal to evaluate, you know how much time it's worth to do that investigation versus to just implement the thing is already in the literature and say, if you want to use it.

138
00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:06.420
Nathan George: It feels like a bit of a sloppy fix to just implement this really large group if we know that there's a better option.

139
00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:17.370
Nathan George: But I know i'm not hearing a lot of confidence that we know that there's a better option just that there's probably a few things we should check on Mike is that that fair I don't want to sign you up for work, as was part of what i'm trying to say here.

140
00:23:17.730 --> 00:23:19.290
Michael Lodder: That that's accurate yes.

141
00:23:23.610 --> 00:23:33.960
Nathan George: So Mike what I don't think anyone else could really say what we should do I think it's kind of a deal, well, I would go with your recommendation here.

142
00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:43.170
Michael Lodder: My yeah my recommendation is can we, is it like is the Community okay with going well, can we get.

143
00:23:45.270 --> 00:23:54.330
Michael Lodder: better guarantees than what we have now, but not quite as good as the full blown one but close enough right such that the risk is more mitigated.

144
00:23:55.350 --> 00:23:57.210
Michael Lodder: By doing one of these other techniques.

145
00:23:57.600 --> 00:24:03.660
Nathan George: It feels to me like the answer that question is yes, and because we're really just trying to catch the malicious cheater.

146
00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:13.710
Nathan George: If you can cheat in a way that's more obscure than what that proof would catch my guess is that the proof that cheating is too expensive practical, but again.

147
00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:24.060
Nathan George: It unless we had a dialogue with the vulnerability writer, where we say here's our check, can you try it again, to see if it breaks i'm not sure how how how how strong my confidence is there.

148
00:24:24.750 --> 00:24:29.850
Nathan George: anytime you presented proof of P Q there's a lot of risk of revealing more than you expect right.

149
00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:43.020
Michael Lodder: kind of yeah the other here's the other thought is to just keep going with what we have and and say here's the proof of step correctness that goes on the ledger.

150
00:24:44.340 --> 00:24:45.480
Michael Lodder: This other proof.

151
00:24:46.890 --> 00:24:51.960
Michael Lodder: You should ask you could ask it from the issuer at any time, but they don't have to publish it.

152
00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:55.050
Michael Lodder: So it's kind of like a sanity check.

153
00:24:58.200 --> 00:24:59.190
Michael Lodder: Does that make sense.

154
00:25:02.340 --> 00:25:09.270
Michael Lodder: Like you just petitioned the issuer to say you have to give me this proof before i'll even accept the credential from you at all.

155
00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:14.430
Michael Lodder: Because you know what the modulus is so Therefore, you can check it.

156
00:25:21.210 --> 00:25:27.000
Camilo Parra: Well, we don't need to know the module is right for the proof that the proof that you're implementing right now.

157
00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:34.410
Nathan George: yeah but the idea here is by putting evidence of the proof that is too large for the ledger in the credential definition, then.

158
00:25:35.310 --> 00:25:44.940
Nathan George: verify can say oh yeah, this is the same credential definition, I saw before i've already looked at that evidence, I agree with it right it's kind of like a it's a route hash kind of a thing.

159
00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:48.750
Nathan George: I know that's an abusive determined.

160
00:25:50.250 --> 00:25:55.950
Nathan George: But I like the idea that, even if the proofs too big, we could still put something in but let the.

161
00:25:57.270 --> 00:26:00.780
Nathan George: folder on the verify or no Yes, this is the same evidence i've seen before.

162
00:26:12.150 --> 00:26:12.990
Michael Lodder: cuz I mean.

163
00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:17.880
Michael Lodder: My guess is the other guy that recommended this he's gonna you know.

164
00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:21.270
Michael Lodder: This proof in my mind is not practical.

165
00:26:23.070 --> 00:26:23.460
Michael Lodder: Right.

166
00:26:24.570 --> 00:26:30.660
Michael Lodder: We encounter this a lot from the theoreticians they say oh just do this and then you go that's not practical right.

167
00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:33.630
Michael Lodder: You know, come up with something that is practical.

168
00:26:35.700 --> 00:26:36.210
Michael Lodder: So.

169
00:26:37.380 --> 00:26:40.470
Michael Lodder: In my mind if there's a way that the you would just.

170
00:26:41.490 --> 00:26:51.720
Michael Lodder: not do this proof, but you do something sufficient or you have them do the proof, but it doesn't go on the ledger but you could ask them for it at any time might be a better idea.

171
00:26:53.370 --> 00:26:54.600
Michael Lodder: i'm open to suggestions.

172
00:26:56.820 --> 00:27:10.980
Camilo Parra: I guess My biggest concern here is is that while there couldn't be better solutions we don't have the time to find better solutions like we're pretty constrained on the top, I guess, like.

173
00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:14.340
Michael Lodder: The best solution is to not use cl signatures at all.

174
00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:17.010
Camilo Parra: Right right right right right yeah I agree with that.

175
00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:19.440
Michael Lodder: Not in the cards yet so.

176
00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:27.120
Camilo Parra: yeah so so there's there's a couple trains that are moving that I can't stop and that's why I suggested this proof.

177
00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:45.510
Camilo Parra: Was that I can't stop I can't stop this being presented at or this one or be ability being revealed at hyper ledger global forum and I can't stop the non credit working group from.

178
00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:47.370
Camilo Parra: From.

179
00:27:48.390 --> 00:28:05.880
Camilo Parra: You know standardizing a non creds that that will be discredited soon after by this by this by this vulnerability, so that those are those are the two time constraints, both of those trains are going faster than I thought they would be and so that's I agree there could be a better solution.

180
00:28:07.230 --> 00:28:16.230
Camilo Parra: it's it's I would hope yeah this is, I like i've read this proof like hundreds of times now and it's huge like it's.

181
00:28:16.710 --> 00:28:28.860
Camilo Parra: it's obviously archaic, but I don't see like a easier quicker solution like are an easier to implement and quicker solutions that are to implement that than this right now that's that those are my concerns.

182
00:28:33.420 --> 00:28:39.330
Michael Lodder: mean the only other solution, I can think of was this one, when I looked around was this one from.

183
00:28:58.230 --> 00:29:11.880
Michael Lodder: Because basically this proof says P, and then are the same size and they're distinct that's what this proof is I think it's smaller they do site, the commit this very this very paper from 99.

184
00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:12.750
Camilo Parra: You know.

185
00:29:13.230 --> 00:29:16.410
Michael Lodder: A guy recommended that's quite gnarly.

186
00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:18.450
Michael Lodder: So.

187
00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:22.440
Michael Lodder: anyway.

188
00:29:28.230 --> 00:29:29.070
Michael Lodder: His his.

189
00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:34.560
Michael Lodder: His proof is substantially smaller but i'm not quite sure if it accomplishes the same thing, yet.

190
00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:40.020
Michael Lodder: Having just kind of briefly glanced at it and giving it a brief read.

191
00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:41.550
Camilo Parra: mm hmm.

192
00:29:44.130 --> 00:29:49.050
Michael Lodder: I mean the output of the proof is, you know that P amp Q, are the same size and they are distinct.

193
00:29:52.140 --> 00:29:52.530
Michael Lodder: yeah.

194
00:29:56.100 --> 00:30:08.310
Camilo Parra: yeah basically the requirements is even if I we can even if we can one of the PRIMES like it would it would be caught in this in this proof, you know.

195
00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:12.420
Michael Lodder: yeah.

196
00:30:13.380 --> 00:30:24.150
Camilo Parra: And that's that's basically the requirement I I think like what we're looking for is being able to run whatever code these the people at.

197
00:30:25.380 --> 00:30:31.620
Camilo Parra: irma have and like them, not being able to to.

198
00:30:32.820 --> 00:30:39.480
Camilo Parra: to correlate me one in the credit Aaron and the credential presentations I guess.

199
00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:42.750
Michael Lodder: yeah.

200
00:30:52.440 --> 00:31:03.030
Camilo Parra: I guess next steps for me would be or for the group and not you don't dig any of this work on Mike I can look papers and.

201
00:31:04.590 --> 00:31:17.310
Camilo Parra: and start talking to heart and and asked him if If those are you know if any of these solutions would guarantee you know get bring the guarantees that we want to fix an ursa.

202
00:31:19.110 --> 00:31:20.370
Michael Lodder: yeah I mean.

203
00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:25.320
Michael Lodder: Just between the three of us wait, this is being recorded right.

204
00:31:26.100 --> 00:31:27.480
Camilo Parra: yeah I don't know how to turn that off.

205
00:31:28.230 --> 00:31:30.360
Michael Lodder: Oh well, maybe I won't say it then.

206
00:31:33.060 --> 00:31:36.750
Michael Lodder: But we can hop on a separate call, if you want to discuss it where it's not recorded.

207
00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:40.470
Camilo Parra: Nathan, what do you think.

208
00:31:43.350 --> 00:31:49.650
Nathan George: um well as long as it's not something that's IP encumbered i'm happy to have an offline.

209
00:31:51.630 --> 00:32:08.970
Nathan George: Not obviously the call today is mostly about the security related issues, so I don't know you can you need to do something to to put the recording in a different category there's nothing on supporting that I think too much trouble as long as papers, already been made public, but particular.

210
00:32:09.780 --> 00:32:15.060
Michael Lodder: papers, the approach that i'm going to talk about all the papers or public there's.

211
00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:29.100
Camilo Parra: yeah and now and then in this and the vulnerability is it, we can talk about it there's no we we've discussed already that it's something that is so, like it's not it would there wouldn't be any.

212
00:32:30.390 --> 00:32:32.190
Camilo Parra: threat if someone found out about it.

213
00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:40.620
Nathan George: Like well immediately my vote here is, I think we know, the next step is we've got to investigate a couple more techniques and.

214
00:32:41.100 --> 00:32:57.480
Nathan George: It sounds like we all want to go off and work on that, so I think with that we probably ought to call this particular discussion over yes Mike and Kim you have any objection to that approach and Mike are you okay to come back with the next round of what you think about to happen here.

215
00:32:57.810 --> 00:32:58.950
Michael Lodder: Sure yeah.

216
00:33:00.030 --> 00:33:04.620
Nathan George: Okay, with that I think so i'm gonna fail off the call and.

217
00:33:05.790 --> 00:33:06.690
Nathan George: we'll talk to you about soon.

218
00:33:07.740 --> 00:33:08.160
Camilo Parra: All right.

219
00:33:08.490 --> 00:33:11.550
Michael Lodder: You can I can give you a zoom meeting, if you want to hop on the BAT.

220
00:33:12.210 --> 00:33:13.020
Camilo Parra: yeah I can do that.

221
00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:21.240
Camilo Parra: yeah thanks everybody or going to just call this this it for today, but thanks and then y'all wait for that link.

222
00:33:21.780 --> 00:33:22.920
Michael Lodder: Jay all right.

223
00:33:23.220 --> 00:33:24.060
Camilo Parra: All right, bye bye.
