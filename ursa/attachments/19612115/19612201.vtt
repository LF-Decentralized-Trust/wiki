00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.060
Nathan George: Hello.

2
00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.930
Jim St. Clair: hi everybody.

3
00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.150
Cam Parra | kiva.org: hey i'm glad if anyone has questions.

4
00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.440
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Even if it's in the beginning.

5
00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:20.490
Nathan George: we're not showing Muhammad as having joined the audio so Muhammad if you could I don't know if you can hear us or not.

6
00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.410
Nathan George: Maybe we should post something like that on chat instead.

7
00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:04.890
Cam Parra | kiva.org: i'm just giving people a couple of minutes to join her to trickle in I know that the areas call kind of went over it's time so.

8
00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:09.210
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Just letting that.

9
00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.660
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Giving those are those folks a chance to jump on the call.

10
00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:27.870
Nathan George: But for those who are not on that call hall a bastion proposed to some device finding stuff thats related to to ease and a few other things that have been very interesting to this.

11
00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:41.250
Nathan George: subset of community in the past, so if you're not if you're not on the discord server yet you might want to make sure you're on there and check out some of the things he posted in the various channels around device Monday.

12
00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:51.180
Jim St. Clair: yeah I haven't gotten to this board, yet I don't know if anybody else has this problem, and I know it's not really a Ram memory.

13
00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:57.330
Muhammad Muhasin: Oh no.

14
00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:11.100
Nathan George: I have not paid much attention to how much memory discord is using I do know that the mobile APP for discord is much better than the mobile APP from rocket chat.

15
00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.620
Jim St. Clair: yeah that's cool I have not run the mobile APP.

16
00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:41.430
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Alright, it looks like.

17
00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:48.330
Cam Parra | kiva.org: It looks like it's been five minutes, so I think we can get started.

18
00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:54.510
Cam Parra | kiva.org: yeah so this might be, I was, I think.

19
00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:56.370
Cam Parra | kiva.org: We have.

20
00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:06.600
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Everyone here has been on this call before or if you haven't if you'd like to introduce yourself, please go ahead and unmute yourself and introduce yourself.

21
00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:26.250
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Alright cool well yeah everyone, welcome to the ursa bi weekly meeting, my name is cam parra.

22
00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:45.660
Cam Parra | kiva.org: I am an engineer@kiva.org and i'm going to be leading this meeting today and yeah we just have some items to go over so just remember that this is a hyper ledger meeting and and trust policy is enforced.

23
00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:47.340
Cam Parra | kiva.org: here.

24
00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:54.870
Cam Parra | kiva.org: And we'll begin with announcements I don't think we have any particular ursa announcements.

25
00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:00.390
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Unless anyone else has an announcement in here that they would like to.

26
00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:03.150
Cam Parra | kiva.org: like to announce.

27
00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:34.710
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Alright cool no announcements then alright so we'll go to our current pull requests and we are still pending on the are wants yes select a pull request I have spoken to Mike he doesn't have the time currently to fix what the main trainers are asking for here.

28
00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:36.960
Cam Parra | kiva.org: So what.

29
00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:55.110
Cam Parra | kiva.org: We propose is that I help out Mike to write some of those tests, I haven't been able to get to that yet, but it is, in my queue of things to do and yeah that's the only part that we have left for this are once yes.

30
00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:57.600
Cam Parra | kiva.org: pull request.

31
00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:03.810
Cam Parra | kiva.org: And yeah I think everyone here is familiar more at this pull request is about just.

32
00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:12.570
Cam Parra | kiva.org: A way to build Z kp circuits and cool stuff there.

33
00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:24.480
Cam Parra | kiva.org: yeah we should we should eventually change this up to have better examples, and not just to be a command line interface, but that will go.

34
00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:27.060
Cam Parra | kiva.org: That will come with time.

35
00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:35.280
Nathan George: And, is this the kind of thing that someone else could jump in and help you with, or is this kind of thing the summary is we're still waiting.

36
00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:40.230
Cam Parra | kiva.org: No, this is something that anyone could jump in and make these tests.

37
00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:47.850
Nathan George: And what would be the benefits to ursa or the benefits of the person who did these tests So what did they get they don't have now.

38
00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:57.600
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Well, if you are wanting to build our quickly set up a as a tip circuit, or you have any.

39
00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:10.380
Cam Parra | kiva.org: yeah you want to work with GPS easily then using this are ones, yes language would would make it easier and you would benefit from from that by getting this pull request and.

40
00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:18.930
Nathan George: So that that's the best sales pitch we have for the recording hopefully someone will will come up and say there's something they might want to do to help.

41
00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:22.560
Cam Parra | kiva.org: yep um.

42
00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:24.630
Cam Parra | kiva.org: So yeah so.

43
00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:40.440
Cam Parra | kiva.org: yeah this is this is something that that might not seem like it's that big of a deal but yeah a lot of people who come to these meetings, want to just start working with GPS that's like their first.

44
00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:45.600
Cam Parra | kiva.org: that's like their first question that they have in mind, and so this would be this would really help them out.

45
00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:49.500
Cam Parra | kiva.org: cool.

46
00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:52.500
Cam Parra | kiva.org: So we'll move on from that.

47
00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:57.510
Cam Parra | kiva.org: yeah so today, I wanted to just go over operation also.

48
00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:13.860
Cam Parra | kiva.org: I think everyone in here has also heard about that, but I was trying let's see I was trying to get a little bit more of the Aries crowd in this in this call, because it's important to them as well as everyone on the call.

49
00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:33.150
Cam Parra | kiva.org: But um yeah so let's just go over operation also, and this is something that was proposed a long time ago and a little bit of history ursa code base is that there's a code base was made to unify the.

50
00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:37.920
Cam Parra | kiva.org: hyper ledger products to use the same.

51
00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:50.070
Cam Parra | kiva.org: crypto primitives or crypto solutions in their in their repos so that people wouldn't be rolling their own crypto, and so this was created.

52
00:09:51.120 --> 00:10:04.020
Cam Parra | kiva.org: A lot of indie a lot of the indie crypto was brought in, and a lot of stuff was rewritten, but it was all done at a pace that was pretty fast, because we needed a solution for Aries and for indie.

53
00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:24.180
Cam Parra | kiva.org: And for other for other repos to start using a a crypto library that had been looked over by crypto experts, and so the way the code was written it was it it you could see a lot of patterns being reused and a lot of.

54
00:10:26.130 --> 00:10:35.580
Cam Parra | kiva.org: You know overcomplicated code that makes it unfriendly to a lot of newcomers and yeah overall it's just.

55
00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:57.810
Cam Parra | kiva.org: A huge library, that you have to that you can't pick stuff apart from so so there's just a lot of things that do benefit did have a lot of benefits but there but it's not easy to use or implement and we'd like to change that so that you know people are not.

56
00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:18.930
Cam Parra | kiva.org: You know, getting frustrated and then you know decided just to go with solutions that even have not been had a proper security check or haven't been verified by cryptographers or crypto engineers and so yeah.

57
00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:26.220
Nathan George: Just just to add a little bit of the history here from from being on the security list early on, it hyper ledger and kind of where.

58
00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:33.750
Nathan George: ursa came from this isn't a theoretical concern, we had a bunch of projects and labs that had rolled their own.

59
00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:49.560
Nathan George: pieces of implementation and many cases they didn't consider it rolling their own crypto but they had enough uniquely combined components that it created a unique protocol or a combination of cryptography that turned out to have some funny problems are not be safe in one way or another.

60
00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:56.130
Nathan George: And it was the kind of thing that it just had a few more eyes on when it was put together would have been fine.

61
00:11:56.910 --> 00:12:05.880
Nathan George: But they were all operating pretty much in isolation from one another, so the thought was by bringing the folks who are working on these parts of the system together underneath ursa.

62
00:12:06.810 --> 00:12:15.540
Nathan George: and getting more eyes on them we would catch those issues earlier on, and but they would be able to find implementations that were already in existence that were better audited.

63
00:12:16.710 --> 00:12:22.500
Nathan George: from both the academic standpoint, in terms of the cryptography that they were building on but also with the implementation side so.

64
00:12:23.250 --> 00:12:27.990
Nathan George: It was the idea of calling the code together, so we have this reusable library was.

65
00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:36.390
Nathan George: With both to get to an implementation that you could just pick up and use that had an ease of use that was easier than going off and trying to roll your own.

66
00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:50.490
Nathan George: But also, this kind of bring people together so they would talk about what it is they were trying to get out of it and find and converge on safer implementations more quickly, and I know heart will have more he could add to that as it as we need to.

67
00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:54.900
Hart Montgomery: I think you guys are doing a great job of explaining the story.

68
00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:58.140
Hart Montgomery: And why we have her set and why we need herself.

69
00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:15.810
Hart Montgomery: So I don't have too much to add it was just a realization of the fact that early on in hyper ledger we had you know a lot of need for new cryptographic code and not a lot of people who are you know able to review it.

70
00:13:17.460 --> 00:13:21.210
Hart Montgomery: So you guys did a great job of summarizing everything already so thanks.

71
00:13:24.390 --> 00:13:33.660
Cam Parra | kiva.org: cool things are anything so yeah So if you so yeah if you've been paying attention, then you clearly can tell that there's.

72
00:13:34.170 --> 00:13:49.560
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Some arm, while all intentions were good we we wanted to get something out there and sometimes that's just part of the development process, you have to get something out there, and you make some mistakes or you make things.

73
00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:54.810
Cam Parra | kiva.org: The way you know it, and so that's what happened to ursa oh go ahead.

74
00:13:57.060 --> 00:14:03.870
Hart Montgomery: I should also say that this is, you know organizational rather than a matter of security.

75
00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:09.480
Hart Montgomery: Right, as some people in this group may know there's a security audit finishing up.

76
00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:16.350
Hart Montgomery: For certain parts of ursa that will we expect to have a generally positive.

77
00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:30.180
Hart Montgomery: outcome, and if anyone in this group wants to be more closely involved in that please feel free to reach out cam and Nathan you've already been volunteered.

78
00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:34.830
Hart Montgomery: But anybody else that's interested, please feel free to reach out.

79
00:14:38.850 --> 00:14:39.270
Hart Montgomery: yep.

80
00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:51.720
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Things are yeah so again urine we're not where where the the code is the code, it might be difficult, but that doesn't mean it's not useful more secure so.

81
00:14:53.520 --> 00:15:06.900
Cam Parra | kiva.org: But one thing that we have seen is that a lot of developers are that the mission that we set out to do was to for set to be that crypto or that crypto library that would unify a lot of.

82
00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:24.840
Cam Parra | kiva.org: A lot of groups, but with a difficult of the difficulty of implementing the code you've seen we've recently seen splintering of those of the group some groups again and what we want to accomplish with operation also is to make.

83
00:15:25.890 --> 00:15:37.110
Cam Parra | kiva.org: This or to fix this problem, so if you don't know operation also is simply the refactoring of the ursa code base.

84
00:15:40.620 --> 00:16:01.020
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Well there's a lot of reasons of why the refactoring is really important, but again, that ease of use and the ability to drive newer newer developers into into ursa is a big deal to us, because we want the ursa project to continue to do what it set out to do have.

85
00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:13.440
Cam Parra | kiva.org: of being that library that can be dependent on for all the hyper ledger projects and external projects that are looking for solid crypto solutions.

86
00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:20.400
Cam Parra | kiva.org: let's see so yeah so there's a lot of things we want you know this will bring in.

87
00:16:21.570 --> 00:16:28.560
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Common crypto primitives and reusable data types into into ursa.

88
00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:42.120
Cam Parra | kiva.org: you'll See also with the with this refactoring you'll see a increase of security, because when ursa was written, it was not that long ago, but it was long enough.

89
00:16:43.320 --> 00:17:01.380
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Time long enough that rust has improved and and security and its implementation so some of the some some of the way a the the code is written will be written in a safer way because those the the rust has those abilities now.

90
00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:07.530
Cam Parra | kiva.org: yeah and just this will make it so that.

91
00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:12.000
Cam Parra | kiva.org: ursa components are chopped up into individual.

92
00:17:13.020 --> 00:17:20.970
Cam Parra | kiva.org: into individual creates an individual yeah so there's gonna be drill crates will be able to be implemented into other crypto solutions.

93
00:17:21.930 --> 00:17:33.570
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Not just ours are or implementation and that's really cool that'll make it so that, if even if someone else's depends on it, we can they can easily just pull down a single create.

94
00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:47.040
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Or if they have an idea, it will just make this it will just make it they'll give the ability to for our normal engineer or someone with a little bit of knowledge about crypto to get really creative and try out.

95
00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:51.270
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Solid you know solid solid crypto solutions.

96
00:17:53.850 --> 00:18:04.830
Cam Parra | kiva.org: yeah and a big thing that that will also come from this is that it will allow people to add their own solutions into ursa and stay in ursa so that.

97
00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:17.580
Cam Parra | kiva.org: We can maintain this code, so that we don't have to we don't have 50 different implementations scattered everywhere, and we have to you know maintain all of those 50 solutions.

98
00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:22.230
Cam Parra | kiva.org: um so how is this going to go on.

99
00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:36.510
Cam Parra | kiva.org: And if anyone has questions I know i'm probably preaching to the choir here but um yeah if anyone has any questions or we should do this differently, please go ahead and raise your hand, and let me know.

100
00:18:37.650 --> 00:18:48.210
Cam Parra | kiva.org: i'm open to all solutions here, this is just something that I personally am going to be doing in my in some of my work time and some of my spare time and I just feel like the.

101
00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:57.150
Cam Parra | kiva.org: The Community could really benefit from it um but yeah so go if you have any concerns questions, please pause me and and let me know.

102
00:18:59.610 --> 00:19:14.970
Cam Parra | kiva.org: cool so yeah, so this is, I should have hyperlink this but, if we go to this link you'll see that this is the issue that was created by Mike lauder, who is the creator of operation also and.

103
00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:23.580
Cam Parra | kiva.org: One of the one of the main contributors to the code base and he he was the one who who thought of this refactoring at first.

104
00:19:24.150 --> 00:19:35.940
Cam Parra | kiva.org: But yeah so how this this refactoring will go, is that we will create that will split apart, or so in a way that it won't currently the code base is not affected by.

105
00:19:36.990 --> 00:19:55.140
Cam Parra | kiva.org: By this splitting up the the core or I mean the the legacy code will still be there until we reach a certain point in in the refactoring where we say you know we the the legacy code is no longer needed and we can get rid of.

106
00:19:56.460 --> 00:20:16.050
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Of this of this CRATE so how it will do it is we will we'll split apart, or so, which was already done by Mike and thanks for Mike for doing that he's not here but i'll think for you guys when I when I get in contact with them, hopefully he'll be at our next meeting, but um.

107
00:20:17.670 --> 00:20:26.130
Cam Parra | kiva.org: yeah but so so everything has been split up, we have ursa core as being.

108
00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:41.400
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Probably the main repo which will will be its own CRATE and all of these ursa underscore directories here will be their own CRATE and will be able to be implemented on their own.

109
00:20:43.530 --> 00:20:54.540
Cam Parra | kiva.org: yeah so so that's already done that's how the organization of the refactoring will be done to the first step that we see here in operation also is to.

110
00:20:55.620 --> 00:21:18.750
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Do the core components and if we take a look at the core components will see that, basically, what it is, is is refactoring the tools that Mike used and other developers who contributed to Ursula used to write the to write the legacy code or what will be the legacy code.

111
00:21:19.830 --> 00:21:29.940
Cam Parra | kiva.org: and make those tools better and easier to implement in in the refactoring so one of the biggest things is that.

112
00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:39.930
Cam Parra | kiva.org: That, for example, we had this key gen option, with which was a generic, which is a generic.

113
00:21:40.950 --> 00:21:45.870
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Macro that was written in raw in in this in our sign rust.

114
00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:53.820
Cam Parra | kiva.org: That was very that wasn't the most modular or the most.

115
00:21:55.770 --> 00:22:04.800
Cam Parra | kiva.org: yeah I guess it didn't have much inheritance to it, it just kind of did things for you and you didn't get to choose, of how your solutions would be implemented.

116
00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:11.160
Cam Parra | kiva.org: which can be kind of detrimental to certain key types and certain.

117
00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:24.780
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Just implementations of a in a inertia and so so yeah so that's what we're setting out to do in this.

118
00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:37.890
Cam Parra | kiva.org: In this first step to creating the core projects is just we're going to simplify things, make it reusable and make it so that when people who are using, for example.

119
00:22:38.520 --> 00:23:00.960
Cam Parra | kiva.org: A certainty type like bls and they have certain a certain way or there's a better way to handle bls than you know any other type of of key, then they can implement it on on the bls key and not apply it to everything all other keys so yeah, so this is, this is the first step here.

120
00:23:03.180 --> 00:23:24.330
Cam Parra | kiva.org: And then, once this is complete we'll go ahead and use all those classes and all the those structures to create the signatures key agreements encryption secret sharing and all these other things that that can be done after we have reflected that the core the core components of versa.

121
00:23:27.540 --> 00:23:30.450
Cam Parra | kiva.org: yeah any questions that's a lot of stuff that I just went over.

122
00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:48.900
Nathan George: So if you're trying to figure out how you can help with the code here what's the right thing to do next, and there's a list there's a ticket.

123
00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:51.930
Nathan George: You know.

124
00:23:52.950 --> 00:23:55.920
Nathan George: Can you step us through a couple of things we should go poking at.

125
00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:02.520
Cam Parra | kiva.org: yeah for sure um so.

126
00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:09.330
Cam Parra | kiva.org: um so yeah So if you so if you want to see you what i'm working on, you can go to.

127
00:24:10.590 --> 00:24:12.570
Cam Parra | kiva.org: You can go to my fork.

128
00:24:15.540 --> 00:24:25.560
Cam Parra | kiva.org: And this is just my name backwards and that's my github username and if you go into my ursa core branch.

129
00:24:26.790 --> 00:24:44.340
Cam Parra | kiva.org: And I haven't updated this, but if you go to ursa core and, if you want to look at what i'm doing you can go and look at some of this stuff and see how I am implementing.

130
00:24:45.780 --> 00:24:59.550
Cam Parra | kiva.org: These new trades and how i'm working on that on those on those tests, I i'll update this probably this week, so if you want to jump in on to my into my fork and just look at what i'm working on.

131
00:25:00.390 --> 00:25:09.270
Cam Parra | kiva.org: that's just some of the work that's going on, but also, if you want to go into these issues, then.

132
00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:22.290
Cam Parra | kiva.org: You can feel free to message me, and you have you have any questions or concerns, and if you want to start get started on working on something just let me know and we can partner up and and you know and and add.

133
00:25:23.820 --> 00:25:25.980
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Whatever you want to contribute.

134
00:25:36.030 --> 00:25:40.920
Cam Parra | kiva.org: cool yeah so uh basically we need volunteers here.

135
00:25:42.630 --> 00:25:49.080
Cam Parra | kiva.org: This is open to anyone who wants to just use their rascals I know a lot of developers.

136
00:25:51.660 --> 00:26:01.800
Cam Parra | kiva.org: that are in the Community don't get are no rust but don't get to use it all the time and sometimes as developers just want to kind of you know stretch our wings and.

137
00:26:03.150 --> 00:26:11.340
Cam Parra | kiva.org: and be able to practice some language that we enjoy, so this is perfect for anyone that's doing that let's see.

138
00:26:16.620 --> 00:26:34.500
Cam Parra | kiva.org: yeah Jim so so that that's correct, so this will be so this will be easier to implement into devices, since it will be smaller So if you need core core components, you know smaller chunks of ursa you will be able to you, we will be able to have that.

139
00:26:36.810 --> 00:26:41.460
Jim St. Clair: Great perfect thanks very much i'm sorry to throw the rhythm off for your present presenting there but.

140
00:26:42.180 --> 00:26:50.490
Jim St. Clair: yeah, so I am part of a sovereign group SSI and iot and we're starting to move into playing around with raspberry pi's is a test bed.

141
00:26:51.660 --> 00:26:58.200
Jim St. Clair: And then i'm also starting some conversations with some device manufacturers and vmware and a few others.

142
00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:12.600
Jim St. Clair: And the SSI and iot group it's got a couple folks and I apologize for forgetting the names, because I think of them a couple of them might be with our work and and there are so workgroup four areas work group who have been doing work on 42 rust as well.

143
00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:16.950
Jim St. Clair: So maybe comparison notes there I can grab your email camp.

144
00:27:17.610 --> 00:27:26.190
Cam Parra | kiva.org: yeah go ahead yeah and it's it's right uh right there um but yeah this will be great for iot I think go ahead.

145
00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:30.210
Hart Montgomery: Sorry, I was just gonna say I unfortunately have to.

146
00:27:30.210 --> 00:27:31.710
Hart Montgomery: drop at 830.

147
00:27:33.780 --> 00:27:46.080
Hart Montgomery: For mandatory meeting, but thank you for organizing cam this is fantastic and if anyone here has any like cryptography questions where you need someone who can you know dig into the math.

148
00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:50.610
Hart Montgomery: Please, please feel free to reach out to me, and let me know.

149
00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:58.410
Hart Montgomery: I have explicitly gotten permission that I can spend time on this when necessary and appropriate.

150
00:27:59.730 --> 00:28:03.420
Hart Montgomery: So so make sure to to ask if you have questions.

151
00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:22.230
Cam Parra | kiva.org: yeah before you leave her um one question to those who are here for the part of the cryptography part is do you have any papers that you would like to discuss in two weeks or any you know any crypto that you want to discuss into.

152
00:28:22.350 --> 00:28:30.810
Hart Montgomery: that's a great question but maybe the thing to do is for other people to pick an area or a topic, and then I can pick a paper.

153
00:28:32.580 --> 00:28:33.120
Cam Parra | kiva.org: yeah.

154
00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:41.850
Hart Montgomery: So you guys can discuss that now or later on the mailing list and i'm always happy to recommend papers.

155
00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:45.990
Hart Montgomery: So there you know I just don't know like what.

156
00:28:47.220 --> 00:28:52.950
Hart Montgomery: You know you guys have a better pulse on sort of what people are interested in at the market level.

157
00:28:55.500 --> 00:29:01.410
Nathan George: i'll propose something right now the areas were group just prior to us just just talking about back to restore.

158
00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:02.340
Hart Montgomery: about what.

159
00:29:03.090 --> 00:29:06.510
Nathan George: They a lot of questions about how you can securely backup and restore.

160
00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:08.670
Nathan George: secrets.

161
00:29:10.170 --> 00:29:13.050
Hart Montgomery: Okay, so like what kind of.

162
00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:31.470
Hart Montgomery: What this see this can go to a lot of different directions right, we could discuss like threshold sizing backups we could discuss like secure storage in the cloud is there any particular aspect that.

163
00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:38.430
Nathan George: I think all of those would be fair game effects surveying some of those topics, along with how backup restore functions as a key rotation.

164
00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:45.150
Nathan George: It could be very interesting to those to that group and pull this more in our direction.

165
00:29:48.180 --> 00:29:54.150
Hart Montgomery: Okay yeah i'll probably reach out to you with some more questions about the specifics behind that.

166
00:29:57.180 --> 00:30:04.980
Hart Montgomery: But yeah i'm i'm happy to do this and I will definitely recommend some stuff for for next week or two weeks.

167
00:30:09.930 --> 00:30:10.560
Cam Parra | kiva.org: cool thanks.

168
00:30:10.980 --> 00:30:14.760
Hart Montgomery: And I do have to drop now so but thank you so much for organizing camp.

169
00:30:14.970 --> 00:30:15.930
Cam Parra | kiva.org: And no worries.

170
00:30:16.650 --> 00:30:17.460
Hart Montgomery: i'll be in touch.

171
00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:20.010
Hart Montgomery: And everyone else, please feel free to reach out as well.

172
00:30:20.310 --> 00:30:20.790
Hart Montgomery: Thank you.

173
00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:30.360
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Thanks her um yeah So if you if you guys don't know who are his heart is the new.

174
00:30:31.980 --> 00:30:33.300
Cam Parra | kiva.org: I believe cto.

175
00:30:35.250 --> 00:30:47.730
Cam Parra | kiva.org: At hyper ledger he is a cryptographer and has helped us out a lot if you ever have any crypto questions he's the guy to go to and not bitcoin.

176
00:30:48.300 --> 00:31:00.390
Cam Parra | kiva.org: or any of the other cryptocurrencies but he's a cryptographer so he's a mathematician So if you have any questions on the math he's probably the guy to go to a lot of us are just implementing others and.

177
00:31:01.410 --> 00:31:04.800
Cam Parra | kiva.org: know some of the math but can't explain it, as well as he, as he can.

178
00:31:06.570 --> 00:31:08.790
Cam Parra | kiva.org: yeah so feel free to reach out the heart.

179
00:31:09.930 --> 00:31:13.980
Cam Parra | kiva.org: But we'll get back to that topic of of what we want to discuss next.

180
00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:35.160
Cam Parra | kiva.org: yep so cool So if you have any if you have any if you need any if you have any volunteers, or if you are a volunteer please feel free to reach out to me on my email and again you don't need a crypto degree to be in on this call, or to participate in ursa.

181
00:31:36.570 --> 00:31:44.160
Cam Parra | kiva.org: And you might if any of you might might might freak out by this and say Oh, you know well that's scary using a crypto library.

182
00:31:44.550 --> 00:31:57.420
Cam Parra | kiva.org: And that's not true, we have about 10 people who are have crypto backgrounds reviewing your code or making sure that what goes into the code base is properly reviewed, as well as.

183
00:31:59.430 --> 00:32:01.650
Cam Parra | kiva.org: As well as various other.

184
00:32:03.990 --> 00:32:07.800
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Institutions doing security reviews on the code base so.

185
00:32:08.820 --> 00:32:10.980
Cam Parra | kiva.org: don't be afraid well the.

186
00:32:11.130 --> 00:32:13.470
Cam Parra | kiva.org: The the code process.

187
00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:14.850
Muhammad Muhasin: is pretty solid here.

188
00:32:14.850 --> 00:32:18.660
Cam Parra | kiva.org: That we have worked on this from since day one.

189
00:32:19.740 --> 00:32:21.030
Nathan George: came oh yeah thanks Bobby.

190
00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:23.400
Cam Parra | kiva.org: i'm.

191
00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:25.260
Cam Parra | kiva.org: sweet so.

192
00:32:27.570 --> 00:32:29.730
Cam Parra | kiva.org: that's my call to all of you.

193
00:32:31.110 --> 00:32:31.710
Cam Parra | kiva.org: um.

194
00:32:33.420 --> 00:32:36.690
Cam Parra | kiva.org: I guess we don't have.

195
00:32:38.490 --> 00:32:55.710
Cam Parra | kiva.org: The areas folks to do this open discussion time of what we want to see change in ursa I can move this over to next in two weeks to try to write to try to get more people from areas and other projects in here to discuss this.

196
00:32:57.630 --> 00:33:11.100
Cam Parra | kiva.org: I guess as a as a small group, since a lot of us have the same things in mind, you know we probably would agree here so i'd like to have a little bit more of a diverse group in order to discuss this.

197
00:33:13.830 --> 00:33:15.300
Cam Parra | kiva.org: But yeah let's see we have.

198
00:33:22.140 --> 00:33:26.250
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Everyone oh yeah I can I can share this I can share this link.

199
00:33:28.860 --> 00:33:32.580
Nathan George: Will you will you will you be putting these slides in the meeting notes of wiki.

200
00:33:33.030 --> 00:33:49.530
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Yes, i'll be I don't I haven't poked around too much on how to do the wiki so that's why I didn't prepare a wiki there there yet, but I will poke around a little bit in that today and add these notes and i'll i'll be posting those notes, also in the.

201
00:33:50.550 --> 00:34:05.460
Cam Parra | kiva.org: In the discord channel, I am very active there, so, if any, if you have any questions, please go ahead and and join that and let's make that are so channel just that main source of communication, but I can drop this link real quick right here.

202
00:34:08.310 --> 00:34:16.500
Nathan George: So basically the idea here is, we have as much time as much time as 20 minutes or 25 minutes as little time as.

203
00:34:16.980 --> 00:34:27.000
Nathan George: As we can just call it to talk about what it what what we might want to have happen either two weeks or what we want to see out ursa or what we think we could contribute to us over the course next little while.

204
00:34:29.250 --> 00:34:43.980
Cam Parra | kiva.org: um yeah so so yeah so we have an open open discussion on on what what we want to do here on what will you'd like to see out of the out of this meeting and yeah if you have any topics that you want to discuss everything is open here.

205
00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:54.450
Cam Parra | kiva.org: It doesn't have to be an intimidating call like if you just want to know more about zero knowledge proofs you know if you want to discuss bb bb s plus.

206
00:34:54.990 --> 00:35:07.800
Cam Parra | kiva.org: If you want to know, like hey I have no idea what you know cryptographic keys, are we can go as basic as that or we can even go back to what is cryptography like anything is open here.

207
00:35:10.140 --> 00:35:15.210
Nathan George: Okay, so we're just the open discussion time anybody can ask whatever they want so who wants to talk about something.

208
00:35:33.990 --> 00:35:46.860
Aruna S M: Since we are open discussion period right, I wanted to bring up this topic so I present i'm not sure how many of you are already know about this, there is a hyper ledger security process Task Force going on.

209
00:35:47.970 --> 00:35:50.640
Aruna S M: And recently in these discussions.

210
00:35:50.730 --> 00:35:53.760
Aruna S M: Like the task force there have been multiple conversations and.

211
00:35:54.030 --> 00:36:11.040
Aruna S M: Security being one of the topic that has to be looked at across the layers now there are plans to create multiple work streams within the task force, each of which will focus on one area and we target to address concerns and proceed to the next one right.

212
00:36:12.150 --> 00:36:17.820
Aruna S M: So it could be interesting to the Community over here if you identify.

213
00:36:23.310 --> 00:36:23.880
Aruna S M: site.

214
00:36:25.350 --> 00:36:37.080
Aruna S M: So if you if you identify an area that you think we need to look at in terms of security processes from the cryptography standpoint, I think our cell community.

215
00:36:37.710 --> 00:36:49.680
Aruna S M: is really big value add for it for us and as part of that tribe, so I would also encourage you to join the task force meetings, if possible, and any inputs from from this community is highly value.

216
00:36:50.700 --> 00:36:52.080
Aruna S M: So we are looking into.

217
00:36:53.100 --> 00:36:56.700
Aruna S M: Security, being a cross domain and cross.

218
00:36:58.230 --> 00:37:01.080
Aruna S M: stack concern techniques to be addressed.

219
00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:10.140
Nathan George: Or what would you say, are the action items, or like in the past, the Security Committee was really more kind of a.

220
00:37:11.190 --> 00:37:19.320
Nathan George: response to issues that come in the door, it sounds like you're you're building kind of sort of work streams What would you say, are the work streams I.

221
00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:34.500
Aruna S M: Right, I guess, know the task force itself for set up, initially, as you know, from the tsa things like there were a few concerns related or maybe it needed revisit and.

222
00:37:35.010 --> 00:37:54.510
Aruna S M: really look into what we follow currently right the process that we follow but it turns out that during this discussions, there are multiple areas like we can focus on, for instance, we can look into the software distribution aspect and the build out of recycled, making sure the the.

223
00:37:56.790 --> 00:37:57.570
Aruna S M: We have.

224
00:37:58.650 --> 00:38:02.730
Aruna S M: What we call it as a way to prove that this build is.

225
00:38:03.180 --> 00:38:03.960
Aruna S M: a valid one.

226
00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:10.650
Aruna S M: Like we did under this this this this particular distribution is a valid one probably signing those binaries right so.

227
00:38:11.580 --> 00:38:19.380
Aruna S M: We started with those kind of discussions, and then we started discussing on hey How do we make sure when a security concern is raised.

228
00:38:19.860 --> 00:38:26.940
Aruna S M: Be score it and how do we escalate such scoring, for instance, if somebody is course if if an issue scores high we.

229
00:38:27.570 --> 00:38:34.800
Aruna S M: need to have a mechanism that it gets fixed and then, how do we communicate it to the rest of the Community over the period of time.

230
00:38:35.730 --> 00:38:45.450
Aruna S M: And then we started discussing around and when we looked into the current scoring islands for CBS CBS there were no points that were relating to a blockchain technology.

231
00:38:46.620 --> 00:38:53.700
Aruna S M: They were very generic in nature, by the scoring for block chain itself could demand additional elements in it.

232
00:38:54.750 --> 00:38:57.600
Aruna S M: Well, and when that topic was being discussed, sorry go ahead.

233
00:38:58.830 --> 00:39:00.330
Nathan George: that's that's interesting.

234
00:39:02.490 --> 00:39:20.400
Aruna S M: Right, so when we started discussing on those terms in this in the task force meetings it the scope kept expanding and we realized that it's time for us to break the task force into multiple work streams then considering it at a larger scope.

235
00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:22.080
Aruna S M: and

236
00:39:23.790 --> 00:39:38.100
Aruna S M: You know that that's that's where we currently stand, and that's where my request is towards the Community if you if you can join in and your input on I live at you know cryptography using cryptography.

237
00:39:39.180 --> 00:39:45.690
Aruna S M: Especially in blockchain technology if we can come up with certain recommendations.

238
00:39:47.310 --> 00:39:49.830
Aruna S M: or even a way to evaluate or validate.

239
00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:55.770
Aruna S M: Have a way to prove the claims right so let's say some of the projects, they say.

240
00:39:56.790 --> 00:40:00.030
Aruna S M: They make certain claims in the documentation, or they make certain.

241
00:40:01.650 --> 00:40:18.810
Aruna S M: assumptions, how do we prove those so I feel, these are the areas where our community can can join in and give inputs, but again it's just my thoughts, but i'm very sure are so communities makes much more than and like i'm being very abstract you.

242
00:40:20.640 --> 00:40:29.940
Nathan George: know in fact with any of these types of groups, they tend to expand to include all possible exploration and one of the challenges is trying to corral everyone.

243
00:40:29.940 --> 00:40:34.110
Nathan George: into the smaller scope of work that will actually make a difference in the.

244
00:40:34.110 --> 00:40:43.620
Nathan George: short term and so, hopefully, one of the things we have that can continue to happen is overlap between the ursa group and the Security Task forces that ursa is.

245
00:40:44.190 --> 00:40:59.190
Nathan George: And was designed coming out of the folks who are working on security to help make it so cryptography at hyper ledger stayed safe and was stayed reliable in a way that helped our Community expand, so you know, hopefully, that that overlap continues to be something that's helpful to you.

246
00:41:01.260 --> 00:41:01.860
Cam Parra | kiva.org: yeah and I think.

247
00:41:02.220 --> 00:41:06.510
Cam Parra | kiva.org: I think we share the same concerns at least I think for me and for.

248
00:41:06.510 --> 00:41:10.710
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Other members of this group, a lot of us are handed the security.

249
00:41:11.730 --> 00:41:27.930
Cam Parra | kiva.org: The security aspects of our projects like we're the ones reporting security concerns to to hyper ledger, so I think we have various opinions of how that process should should go.

250
00:41:29.190 --> 00:41:39.870
Cam Parra | kiva.org: If needed, and I think we were last time we were reporting stuff was from one of our code audits and the process just wasn't very clear and I think that's why that.

251
00:41:41.070 --> 00:41:51.300
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Well, I think, from a long time, like just the security process hasn't been clear and so that it sounds like that's why they they're making this task force.

252
00:41:51.630 --> 00:41:57.510
Nathan George: Well that's not surprised right because they've used to be handled a lot of that stuff as full time staff for hyper ledger for a while.

253
00:41:57.810 --> 00:42:07.080
Nathan George: And he was able to put a lot of stuff in place that has since gone a little bit stale just because Community members have moved on and done gone on to do other things, and so a ruse work to.

254
00:42:07.770 --> 00:42:20.970
Nathan George: reorganize all that and get everybody back to the same page is really important there i'm Brent and Adam we haven't heard much from you have a holiday, you have anything you want to talk about or anything you want to say you know come up you just throw it in.

255
00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:24.780
Brent Zundel: I do want to say i'm thrilled about operation also.

256
00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:27.330
Brent Zundel: You know, having lift off apparently.

257
00:42:28.620 --> 00:42:35.880
Brent Zundel: I was thrilled when it was first suggested by Mike and you know, have been hammering against.

258
00:42:38.430 --> 00:42:43.080
Brent Zundel: The available resources trying to actually be able to contribute still hammering.

259
00:42:44.610 --> 00:42:44.850
Brent Zundel: But.

260
00:42:46.110 --> 00:42:46.950
Brent Zundel: yeah love to see you.

261
00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:58.500
Cam Parra | kiva.org: yeah it's exciting I I don't know how much I still have to see, I have a lot of things going on in my personal and my and my work time right now, but I have to see.

262
00:42:59.070 --> 00:43:06.960
Cam Parra | kiva.org: What i'm what we can do, but even hyper ledger wants to or heart mentioned a hyper ledger wanting to throw interns.

263
00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:15.630
Cam Parra | kiva.org: And hyper ledger interns into this project, so it could be, it could be something that gets a lot of momentum i'm hoping that it gets a lot of momentum, but.

264
00:43:15.960 --> 00:43:38.700
Cam Parra | kiva.org: If if anyone wants to mentor if anyone wants to go into this project and mentor a Internet hyper ledger that's available, we can discuss on how that process goes and and yeah and writing it and you're doing a write up on on on just project or an operation also and requesting an intern.

265
00:43:39.270 --> 00:43:44.130
Nathan George: Well, plus is the joy and frustration of photographs traits so come on it doesn't want to try to do that.

266
00:43:45.450 --> 00:43:54.570
Cam Parra | kiva.org: And it's also if you have worked with Mike and you look up to him as a crypto engineer you you, you will be able to learn some of his.

267
00:43:55.380 --> 00:44:10.680
Cam Parra | kiva.org: ways of thinking, because it's very clear in the code once you start once you start reading it so pretty cool um but yeah i'm excited about it as well, I hope that I hope to get a I hope to get ursa core.

268
00:44:12.870 --> 00:44:29.160
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Running I can't commit to any timeline but, but I hope that that's something that this this year will bring us is just at least or sick or and getting some people hyped about it and contribute contributing to the other components of versa.

269
00:44:33.900 --> 00:44:38.130
Cam Parra | kiva.org: What about Adam do you have any topics that you'd like to discuss, I know that you.

270
00:44:38.130 --> 00:44:52.050
Cam Parra | kiva.org: haven't been in the speeding attend before, but if you have any any topics, you want to talk about if you have any if you have any suggestions of what we should do next you're welcome to share that with us.

271
00:44:52.500 --> 00:45:00.090
Adam Burdett: yeah, of course, thanks for hosting cam, this is a great meeting um have you guys had discussions on how this.

272
00:45:01.260 --> 00:45:05.940
Adam Burdett: might affect the areas as car project.

273
00:45:10.740 --> 00:45:13.860
Cam Parra | kiva.org: What do you mean on what what what what would be affected.

274
00:45:16.380 --> 00:45:22.590
Nathan George: I can take it to things off the top of my head one was asked her use some code out of ursa early on.

275
00:45:23.010 --> 00:45:35.250
Nathan George: And refactor it and use it in a little bit of a different way, I think my understanding is most that duplication has since been consolidated back down into ursa cam is that is that true that they've been able to get back on the line.

276
00:45:36.300 --> 00:45:41.940
Cam Parra | kiva.org: um no that was Aries Aries Aries is Aries and Aries.

277
00:45:42.120 --> 00:45:45.570
Nathan George: It was the area's asked our library REX that's thing or we're talking about right now.

278
00:45:45.840 --> 00:45:47.610
Cam Parra | kiva.org: yeah but but.

279
00:45:48.810 --> 00:45:54.300
Cam Parra | kiva.org: We were concerned, you know we're concerned about a bunch of people who were implementing bbs plus.

280
00:45:55.980 --> 00:46:04.530
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Just copying and pasting bbs plus Code into different repos that's been confirmed that it's not true for.

281
00:46:05.790 --> 00:46:08.460
Cam Parra | kiva.org: occupy and.

282
00:46:09.510 --> 00:46:11.850
Cam Parra | kiva.org: I believe yeah the the main.

283
00:46:14.220 --> 00:46:23.610
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Though I shouldn't say the main but like.net and javascript areas javascript but I can't confirm that for asked card from the last time I saw it.

284
00:46:23.970 --> 00:46:34.140
Cam Parra | kiva.org: It was still using a copy and paste code from from bbs plus I don't I haven't asked about that, but I can ask if if that's a concern.

285
00:46:34.860 --> 00:46:44.940
Cam Parra | kiva.org: And I yeah I don't I don't want to be insensitive to anybody and I don't want to be accusatory of asking that so I.

286
00:46:45.510 --> 00:46:57.660
Cam Parra | kiva.org: I don't want to push that too far, but um but yeah that's something that we can talk about then maybe we can bring in some of the some of the implementations there and and see what what we can do to help them to.

287
00:46:58.200 --> 00:47:01.890
Nathan George: So, so we see Andrew, we should not tell him that cams out for his blood.

288
00:47:02.250 --> 00:47:02.610
yep.

289
00:47:04.470 --> 00:47:08.040
Adam Burdett: yeah I was gonna say we're among friends there's yeah.

290
00:47:09.750 --> 00:47:11.580
Adam Burdett: No worries I.

291
00:47:13.320 --> 00:47:26.580
Adam Burdett: i'm not deep in the code on ursa or asked are currently I was hoping that, as far was consuming more features of versa, and I think the refactored you would.

292
00:47:27.150 --> 00:47:44.820
Adam Burdett: Talk that we've talked about is the great direction for all the repos and yeah I was just curious if if ups, is a downstream is started to see the action items you're pointing out, but.

293
00:47:46.170 --> 00:47:49.080
Adam Burdett: um yeah really interested interesting.

294
00:47:51.030 --> 00:48:02.250
Cam Parra | kiva.org: yeah well we'll have to work with that we, we want to bring everybody back to the fold of ursa because, just because of the value that it has we don't want anyone to recreate.

295
00:48:03.600 --> 00:48:08.850
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Especially something like bbs plus where it's, something that would be.

296
00:48:09.780 --> 00:48:17.340
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Well, so you have to realize I guess the the history of bbs plus and realize that a lot of this code is coming from the same person.

297
00:48:17.850 --> 00:48:31.080
Cam Parra | kiva.org: And the same if the if that same person makes an update and ursa and it doesn't trickle down to ask our or anyone else, then you know that could bring in big security vulnerabilities.

298
00:48:32.250 --> 00:48:51.150
Cam Parra | kiva.org: So yeah so just if we can avoid that at all costs to it'll be good I yeah I I, I wonder if there's more projects that like asked card, but if but yeah I guess asked her success would be if we had this project also succeed as well, because we have those crypto.

299
00:48:52.200 --> 00:48:59.100
Cam Parra | kiva.org: We have those core crypto components available for them to use and not feel frustrated that they.

300
00:49:00.120 --> 00:49:04.890
Cam Parra | kiva.org: have to basically rip whole sections of ursa in order to get one thing to work for them.

301
00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:06.360
Nathan George: um.

302
00:49:07.620 --> 00:49:25.830
Nathan George: Has anyone talk to her looked at the sequel interface issues, I know that we've had that conversation maybe every prompt six six months or 12 months or so around you know, whereas go added terms being consumed see callable library have there been any breakthroughs for improvements there.

303
00:49:27.360 --> 00:49:43.380
Cam Parra | kiva.org: No, but that's interesting because also Aries go does not consumer Sir, and it also because of that and also has rewritten, a lot of this bbs plus and a lot of its own cryptography.

304
00:49:51.420 --> 00:49:59.310
Cam Parra | kiva.org: But I don't have a clue I haven't looked into, integral and to see if it can consume see call will rot libraries last time.

305
00:50:00.510 --> 00:50:11.790
Cam Parra | kiva.org: I talked about that, with people about why it had an herbicide and implemented to go, they just said that they did their own thing but it wasn't about the sega libraries.

306
00:50:46.200 --> 00:50:58.710
Cam Parra | kiva.org: cool well um does anyone have any other questions or concerns or does that answer your question Nathan that doesn't really answer your question, but I don't have any other comments I don't know if anyone else has any other comments on that.

307
00:51:01.170 --> 00:51:06.390
Jim St. Clair: I had a new issue or excuse me, I had a new question if we're trending topics.

308
00:51:08.820 --> 00:51:09.780
Cam Parra | kiva.org: Are you okay with that anything.

309
00:51:12.300 --> 00:51:16.050
Nathan George: Oh i'm just trying to bring up topics to get other people to talk so Jim by all means.

310
00:51:16.470 --> 00:51:26.790
Jim St. Clair: haha thanks buddy hey I, and I apologize if you've covered this previously, this was the first ursa meeting I can make, but for those who who didn't see it.

311
00:51:29.880 --> 00:51:34.560
Jim St. Clair: A neo john had a report that he Commission from a.

312
00:51:35.700 --> 00:51:38.490
Jim St. Clair: Security consultancy with regards to.

313
00:51:40.380 --> 00:51:50.670
Jim St. Clair: crypto and cma with the vc crypto specifically and the report was we put the report online on his linkedin page.

314
00:51:51.330 --> 00:51:58.740
Jim St. Clair: I can download it share it if you haven't seen it, but it includes a number of recommendations, while he's not explicit about it.

315
00:51:59.370 --> 00:52:10.530
Jim St. Clair: I understand neil's interests in having the vc crypto framework align with more of a physical compliant phipps 140 dash to.

316
00:52:11.430 --> 00:52:19.410
Jim St. Clair: sort of framework, and there are a number of recommendations which he's going to turn over to this ECG to see whether they bothered to do them or not.

317
00:52:19.650 --> 00:52:28.530
Jim St. Clair: But I wasn't sure if there are crypto dependencies between the BC framework and ursa enough to bring this up for consideration, and if there were i'd be happy to share the Info.

318
00:52:29.610 --> 00:52:34.380
Nathan George: it'd be cool to see the report, so I think we should definitely get the link into the notes the very least.

319
00:52:34.830 --> 00:52:35.220
Okay.

320
00:52:37.680 --> 00:52:48.060
Nathan George: I still want to have kind of a fisticuffs over how identifiers were bound in the core vc spec and i'm curious to see what their security, out of this did with that part of the audit.

321
00:52:49.260 --> 00:53:00.360
Jim St. Clair: Well, and i'm starting to get into a number of initiatives, where these things may be specifically customized or we work through the issues or fork it or whatever to get into.

322
00:53:01.650 --> 00:53:11.790
Jim St. Clair: Physical compliant framework because i'm having more serious conversations in a federal identity management work group around decentralized identity and Indian areas, and I think with work like.

323
00:53:12.180 --> 00:53:22.680
Jim St. Clair: PC tf and the identity wallets and stuff like that, the more we can approve, you know physical federal compliance side configurations for the indie Aries specie stack.

324
00:53:23.580 --> 00:53:33.420
Jim St. Clair: And the to IP stack Overall, the better we are and i've been kind of waving my arms around about this for about 18 months, but of course haven't had something substantive to start looking at, and I think we're getting there.

325
00:53:34.050 --> 00:53:44.700
Nathan George: Well, and professionally kiva where we've been doing federal ID card implementations around the world, so we're very interested in that So if you have something you want to gang up on be happy to help.

326
00:53:45.180 --> 00:53:46.020
Jim St. Clair: yeah sounds good.

327
00:53:47.880 --> 00:53:54.900
Jim St. Clair: yeah i'll probably email it back out to the list will take me a few minutes to dig it up on linkedin and i'm not on the discord but but i'll send it out that way.

328
00:53:54.900 --> 00:53:55.500
Jim St. Clair: If that helps.

329
00:53:59.010 --> 00:54:00.060
Cam Parra | kiva.org: works Jim Thank you.

330
00:54:02.220 --> 00:54:03.000
Cam Parra | kiva.org: um.

331
00:54:04.020 --> 00:54:09.570
Cam Parra | kiva.org: yeah uh I was hoping Brent would answer some of the phipps compliance stuff but.

332
00:54:10.620 --> 00:54:11.730
Cam Parra | kiva.org: He had to drop.

333
00:54:13.950 --> 00:54:14.730
Cam Parra | kiva.org: um.

334
00:54:14.850 --> 00:54:23.010
Jim St. Clair: that's okay Kim because, as I recall, it was about six or seven months ago, or something I was on, and I know that Brett was on and Nathan was on and we had a good.

335
00:54:23.400 --> 00:54:38.010
Jim St. Clair: 45 minute discussion about the challenges of fits but, but I did think that since there were discrete recommendations that came out of this report on the vc specification, there may be, you know implications down to earth and it wasn't even.

336
00:54:39.060 --> 00:54:48.540
Jim St. Clair: Specific so much is just certain refinements to the shot 256 and a few other things you know upgrade changing things to as a few others, that that would be you know a good idea.

337
00:54:52.800 --> 00:54:56.280
