Victor Gridnevsky: Okay.

8
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.899
Victor Gridnevsky: I don't think anyone is here. We can wait for ten minutes or so. But yeah,

9
00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:19.399
Victor Gridnevsky: I'm going to forward to you some messages, and i'm going to command from the happening. But it's something to.

10
00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:25.720
Victor Gridnevsky: So

11
00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:28.460
I will be talking with you guys.

12
00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:43.219
Victor Gridnevsky: It's It's Also, it's. I don't like telegram very much.

13
00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:46.790
Victor Gridnevsky: I don't care about it.

14
00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:05.120
Victor Gridnevsky: Look

15
00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:24.860
Victor Gridnevsky: so.

16
00:08:28.690 --> 00:08:30.440
Victor Gridnevsky: Yeah,

17
00:08:34.289 --> 00:08:35.740
Victor Gridnevsky: that's all good.

18
00:08:37.289 --> 00:08:38.450
Victor Gridnevsky: Hmm.

19
00:08:39.409 --> 00:08:45.590
Victor Gridnevsky: Yes, uh, so a little bit like a little guy. Um!

20
00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:03.190
Victor Gridnevsky: And

21
00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:26.180
Victor Gridnevsky: you know, with all this time I was absent. I am really really to fix it so I will be helping this guy

22
00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:28.149
Victor Gridnevsky: with Oh, my goodness,

23
00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:31.850
Victor Gridnevsky: with all his questions! But

24
00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:36.480
Victor Gridnevsky: i'm not so. He's this

25
00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:39.410
Victor Gridnevsky: mhm

26
00:10:05.410 --> 00:10:10.250
Victor Gridnevsky: so, and she doesn't uh have questions yet,

27
00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:16.540
Victor Gridnevsky: so I think I have been designing a

28
00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:18.710
Victor Gridnevsky: but not really

29
00:10:19.610 --> 00:10:23.810
Victor Gridnevsky: uh. It's better if i'll answer all his questions.

30
00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:55.710
By the way it's I realize it, and i'm gonna send the but still.

31
00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:17.739
Victor Gridnevsky: So I wonder. Yeah, he is not here anymore.

32
00:11:20.910 --> 00:11:28.520
Victor Gridnevsky: Um, by the way, it's about this week. It's not about this week. We are present at the middle of the next week. Right?

33
00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:31.549
Victor Gridnevsky: We like Florida.

34
00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:36.160
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Um! The sooner we do it the better.

35
00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:38.649
Victor Gridnevsky: Okay,

36
00:11:39.130 --> 00:11:40.570
Aleksandr Petrosyan: I'd like to.

37
00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:48.750
Victor Gridnevsky: Well, and the way at least, I want to feel the left side. So there are less questions about its contents

38
00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:52.049
Victor Gridnevsky: because it looks silly right now.

39
00:11:55.290 --> 00:11:56.190
Hmm.

40
00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:01.240
Victor Gridnevsky: Hmm!

41
00:12:04.010 --> 00:12:12.319
Victor Gridnevsky: And they have a chair. Now, i'm not a line on a

42
00:12:26.090 --> 00:12:26.940
Aleksandr Petrosyan: all right,

43
00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:46.430
Victor Gridnevsky: so I guess the the plan about us is

44
00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:48.510
Victor Gridnevsky: not aing them today.

45
00:12:53.730 --> 00:12:54.980
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Uh,

46
00:13:54.050 --> 00:13:57.039
Victor Gridnevsky: let's check as a type of lunch that we can. Maybe

47
00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:18.310
that's

48
00:14:22.750 --> 00:14:23.940
Victor Gridnevsky: yeah.

49
00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:26.050
Victor Gridnevsky: So

50
00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:29.649
Victor Gridnevsky: there is ten. Notice about it to be an active,

51
00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:34.760
Victor Gridnevsky: but not really.

52
00:14:36.170 --> 00:14:39.249
Victor Gridnevsky: I guess it's an automatic one.

53
00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.700
How is Israel?

54
00:14:50.610 --> 00:14:54.599
Victor Gridnevsky: I'm. Usual very similar to Russia,

55
00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:59.299
Victor Gridnevsky: actually very similar to Russia, because

56
00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:01.090
Victor Gridnevsky: quite well,

57
00:15:08.790 --> 00:15:16.800
Victor Gridnevsky: if i'm being honest, um, I don't know which is better, because here it's very warm,

58
00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:18.870
Victor Gridnevsky: and it's another on this

59
00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:20.780
Victor Gridnevsky: for me, please,

60
00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:23.289
Victor Gridnevsky: because it's good for health,

61
00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:27.689
Victor Gridnevsky: but i'm not sure it is uh the same

62
00:15:27.750 --> 00:15:31.549
Victor Gridnevsky: fresh, and that's it. So

63
00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:34.139
Victor Gridnevsky: it's not as clean

64
00:15:34.810 --> 00:15:36.520
Victor Gridnevsky: and three so

65
00:15:36.810 --> 00:15:40.060
Victor Gridnevsky: well, it's

66
00:15:40.210 --> 00:15:43.520
Victor Gridnevsky: because it's hot outside. And

67
00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:44.840
Victor Gridnevsky: yeah,

68
00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:47.480
Victor Gridnevsky: um,

69
00:15:50.690 --> 00:15:58.470
Victor Gridnevsky: so it's surprising. So presently in normal, if things are stable. As for me, if um

70
00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:01.029
i'm allowed to stay here,

71
00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:03.479
Victor Gridnevsky: I guess this is good,

72
00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:08.289
Victor Gridnevsky: but when I I will travel

73
00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:09.610
Victor Gridnevsky: because

74
00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:13.050
Victor Gridnevsky: it's just right in our

75
00:16:13.690 --> 00:16:16.649
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Where will you travel?

76
00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:19.770
Victor Gridnevsky: Um,

77
00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:24.190
Victor Gridnevsky: I want to do it again.

78
00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:30.020
Victor Gridnevsky: What if there is a remain here?

79
00:16:32.950 --> 00:16:35.329
Aleksandr Petrosyan: The reason I mean here.

80
00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:38.079
Victor Gridnevsky: Yes, yes, if there is

81
00:16:40.390 --> 00:16:41.430
Victor Gridnevsky: uh

82
00:16:44.130 --> 00:16:47.129
Victor Gridnevsky: a description of the police.

83
00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:58.290
Aleksandr Petrosyan: George is very nice.

84
00:16:59.050 --> 00:17:03.030
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Georgia is nice. It's? Actually, it's It's actually extremely nice.

85
00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:04.530
Victor Gridnevsky: Oh,

86
00:17:05.030 --> 00:17:05.950
Aleksandr Petrosyan: yeah,

87
00:17:07.230 --> 00:17:09.909
Aleksandr Petrosyan: um, believe it or not. I actually,

88
00:17:10.210 --> 00:17:12.820
Aleksandr Petrosyan: in most cases I would prefer to go there.

89
00:17:14.550 --> 00:17:16.510
Victor Gridnevsky: Hmm. Interesting?

90
00:17:17.130 --> 00:17:18.130
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Yeah,

91
00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:27.829
Aleksandr Petrosyan: yeah, yeah.

92
00:17:27.930 --> 00:17:31.080
Victor Gridnevsky: What's emirates?

93
00:17:31.460 --> 00:17:34.000
Victor Gridnevsky: Because the whole airport was

94
00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:35.690
Victor Gridnevsky: I'm! There

95
00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:39.710
Victor Gridnevsky: it's like Moscow, but more high tech,

96
00:17:39.930 --> 00:17:45.030
Victor Gridnevsky: and that it's old enough, was scraped completely,

97
00:17:45.730 --> 00:17:48.820
Victor Gridnevsky: and this is a bit second.

98
00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:55.099
Victor Gridnevsky: Nothing is old. Well, lesson is old enough.

99
00:17:55.670 --> 00:17:59.370
Victor Gridnevsky: Um! Everything is expensive

100
00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:05.990
Victor Gridnevsky: and just airport terminals uh massive structures that

101
00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:09.029
I focused about that on some markets.

102
00:18:09.550 --> 00:18:12.379
Victor Gridnevsky: So I was very confused,

103
00:18:13.730 --> 00:18:28.279
Victor Gridnevsky: and it's a place of transition. So um! Nobody was asking much, But then I was asked for my documents for reputation, and so on, because I was not a tourist,

104
00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:34.970
Victor Gridnevsky: otherwise no control whatsoever. So my name just just show their tickets.

105
00:18:36.630 --> 00:18:38.389
Victor Gridnevsky: Very confusing place.

106
00:18:47.030 --> 00:18:49.150
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Sounds like you had. It covered.

107
00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:50.920
Victor Gridnevsky: What

108
00:18:51.150 --> 00:18:53.199
Aleksandr Petrosyan: sounds like you had it covered.

109
00:18:53.930 --> 00:18:55.180
Victor Gridnevsky: Yep,

110
00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:01.600
Victor Gridnevsky: thanks for that. Uh,

111
00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:22.859
Victor Gridnevsky: It's very confusing, because I don't have one document that that's good. Confirm the link

112
00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:28.090
Victor Gridnevsky: about my grandmother, so they could ask it, they could be ignore it.

113
00:19:29.030 --> 00:19:35.330
Victor Gridnevsky: Uh, It's all about time and time. Here is confusion, the interfaces

114
00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:38.160
Victor Gridnevsky: I want

115
00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:42.490
Victor Gridnevsky: because um,

116
00:19:42.770 --> 00:19:45.690
Victor Gridnevsky: every time you try to do something. It's like

117
00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:48.219
Victor Gridnevsky: It's like when

118
00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:50.220
Aleksandr Petrosyan: mhm

119
00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:54.630
Victor Gridnevsky: and

120
00:19:55.780 --> 00:19:57.450
Victor Gridnevsky: I don't know why

121
00:19:57.940 --> 00:19:59.560
Victor Gridnevsky: I don't know the reason,

122
00:20:00.610 --> 00:20:06.380
Victor Gridnevsky: but it's a good um motivation to get outside and do something outside.

123
00:20:06.450 --> 00:20:08.070
Victor Gridnevsky: So that sounds great

124
00:20:08.090 --> 00:20:13.089
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Christmas the whole Christmas season. Now, please don't ask why? No one quite knows the reason.

125
00:20:13.490 --> 00:20:14.710
Victor Gridnevsky: Yeah,

126
00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:18.400
Victor Gridnevsky: like after Russia.

127
00:20:21.050 --> 00:20:29.889
Victor Gridnevsky: I did not understand why people were telling. We have a very good program in school, and so on and so forth. But

128
00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:34.240
Victor Gridnevsky: here, with all these interfaces. Yeah, I understand.

129
00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:38.390
Victor Gridnevsky: Some people just gave up on some parts, and

130
00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:43.120
Victor Gridnevsky: it's the it's got to them

131
00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:46.470
Victor Gridnevsky: and it's here the same

132
00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:52.560
Aleksandr Petrosyan: makes sense.

133
00:20:54.330 --> 00:20:56.559
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Did you think Well,

134
00:20:57.340 --> 00:20:59.930
Victor Gridnevsky: I don't know. I don't know It's like

135
00:21:01.410 --> 00:21:02.550
Victor Gridnevsky: um.

136
00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:12.099
Victor Gridnevsky: I don't think I don't think I will see much of this side of tech anymore, as you might imagine

137
00:21:12.910 --> 00:21:14.950
I mean the old national tech.

138
00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:17.330
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Um,

139
00:21:18.190 --> 00:21:19.549
Aleksandr Petrosyan: don't be so sure of it.

140
00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:26.159
Aleksandr Petrosyan: It's not about Russian. Um! It's not specifically Russian text that you are worried about right.

141
00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:29.140
Aleksandr Petrosyan: You're mostly actually worried about.

142
00:21:29.300 --> 00:21:30.770
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Shall we say

143
00:21:31.330 --> 00:21:33.560
Aleksandr Petrosyan: a specific persuasion?

144
00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:37.169
Um tech that behaves a certain way,

145
00:21:38.010 --> 00:21:39.330
Victor Gridnevsky: Mhm,

146
00:21:39.930 --> 00:21:42.669
Victor Gridnevsky: not really, for example, of the bank.

147
00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:47.010
Victor Gridnevsky: It was uh we at last

148
00:21:47.550 --> 00:21:49.300
Victor Gridnevsky: All this Ai stuff.

149
00:21:49.430 --> 00:21:51.330
Victor Gridnevsky: This is the computer, but

150
00:21:51.890 --> 00:21:56.820
Victor Gridnevsky: um! The piles of money they used for each of the sides of their projects,

151
00:21:58.270 --> 00:22:02.090
Victor Gridnevsky: everything working smoothly mostly, and

152
00:22:02.130 --> 00:22:05.909
Victor Gridnevsky: people who can help you. Well, since uh normal,

153
00:22:05.990 --> 00:22:12.299
Victor Gridnevsky: well, since uh, not normal, yeah, it's completely shut down and everything is broken. But

154
00:22:12.910 --> 00:22:16.450
Victor Gridnevsky: when people uh

155
00:22:16.740 --> 00:22:22.939
Victor Gridnevsky: it's a very oil question, and it's a good one.

156
00:22:25.310 --> 00:22:28.950
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Uh yeah uh, sorry. I didn't mean to disrupt

157
00:22:28.970 --> 00:22:30.170
Victor Gridnevsky: It's all good,

158
00:22:42.930 --> 00:22:45.620
Aleksandr Petrosyan: because it's more convenient to use on,

159
00:22:46.370 --> 00:22:48.399
Victor Gridnevsky: and that's not working

160
00:22:48.510 --> 00:22:49.720
Victor Gridnevsky: up there

161
00:22:52.550 --> 00:22:53.930
Victor Gridnevsky: after twelve,

162
00:22:56.990 --> 00:22:58.380
Victor Gridnevsky: because of what

163
00:22:58.520 --> 00:23:01.020
Victor Gridnevsky: my bank for the work of the well.

164
00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:06.549
Victor Gridnevsky: So. Yeah. And then once the morning

165
00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:19.810
Victor Gridnevsky: number this here still,

166
00:23:21.110 --> 00:23:22.810
Victor Gridnevsky: and it's twelve minutes

167
00:23:22.940 --> 00:23:30.820
Aleksandr Petrosyan: they they won't be they won't be for a while. We should probably wait for another few minutes, and then

168
00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:34.060
Victor Gridnevsky: so you

169
00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:37.020
Victor Gridnevsky: Not that I mean anything.

170
00:23:38.130 --> 00:23:39.170
Victor Gridnevsky: It's just

171
00:23:39.510 --> 00:23:46.090
Victor Gridnevsky: love surprising. I will be, I think, of a better way of storing my documents.

172
00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:49.190
Victor Gridnevsky: I don't know, because

173
00:23:54.820 --> 00:23:57.169
Victor Gridnevsky: some parts uh

174
00:23:57.270 --> 00:23:59.439
Victor Gridnevsky: why don't, some parts are shortened.

175
00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:01.470
Victor Gridnevsky: It's not the big one.

176
00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:05.170
Victor Gridnevsky: Your text

177
00:24:06.850 --> 00:24:09.979
Aleksandr Petrosyan: giving the uh, what are you referring to

178
00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:11.750
Victor Gridnevsky: if you calling

179
00:24:13.490 --> 00:24:16.110
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Uh: Well, okay. Um.

180
00:24:16.530 --> 00:24:23.460
Aleksandr Petrosyan: So regarding that one um, they wanted me to give them content. I gave them content. Um, what

181
00:24:23.510 --> 00:24:25.890
Aleksandr Petrosyan: what they want to do with it is up to them,

182
00:24:26.130 --> 00:24:30.089
Aleksandr Petrosyan: in my opinion. They uh

183
00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:33.630
Aleksandr Petrosyan: they've already asked me for uh a lot

184
00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:35.779
Aleksandr Petrosyan: instead of them,

185
00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:41.429
Aleksandr Petrosyan: so if they still can't figure out what to do. Um! They should probably do it on their own.

186
00:24:42.370 --> 00:24:43.530
Victor Gridnevsky: That's something.

187
00:24:43.810 --> 00:24:46.119
Victor Gridnevsky: But the description was

188
00:24:51.710 --> 00:24:55.749
Victor Gridnevsky: so. Here is this guy and hef all over the glance.

189
00:24:57.470 --> 00:24:58.840
Victor Gridnevsky: There you go,

190
00:25:00.970 --> 00:25:03.190
Victor Gridnevsky: I hope he at least say something.

191
00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:09.069
Victor Gridnevsky: So far it's done, and I have to talk about weeks again,

192
00:25:26.790 --> 00:25:27.640
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Mhm?

193
00:25:31.620 --> 00:25:35.240
Aleksandr Petrosyan: And i'm taking the opportunity to. You know,

194
00:25:36.210 --> 00:25:37.800
Aleksandr Petrosyan: consolidate my

195
00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:39.620
Aleksandr Petrosyan: everything. Really,

196
00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:45.040
Aleksandr Petrosyan: it looks like I can.

197
00:25:48.810 --> 00:25:49.949
You can freeze everything.

198
00:25:52.270 --> 00:25:53.489
Victor Gridnevsky: What do you mean?

199
00:25:54.760 --> 00:25:55.970
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Okay, I hope.

200
00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:57.720
Victor Gridnevsky: Hmm.

201
00:25:57.750 --> 00:25:59.780
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Basically, Um.

202
00:26:01.370 --> 00:26:07.880
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Yeah. Let's wait for another ten minutes, and then we probably should just call each other directly.

203
00:26:07.950 --> 00:26:08.950
Yes,

204
00:26:11.210 --> 00:26:14.070
Aleksandr Petrosyan: maybe talk. We Haven't talked in a while, have we?

205
00:26:14.850 --> 00:26:21.959
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Okay? I know that this sounds silly. Given that you were you were here yesterday. But yeah

206
00:26:22.530 --> 00:26:26.670
Aleksandr Petrosyan: it it. It was a way along the it felt like

207
00:26:26.870 --> 00:26:28.270
Victor Gridnevsky: quite a while.

208
00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:44.080
Victor Gridnevsky: Hmm.

209
00:26:50.350 --> 00:26:51.820
Victor Gridnevsky: I'm surprised.

210
00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:56.420
Victor Gridnevsky: I'm surprised about it.

211
00:27:00.620 --> 00:27:01.809
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Not really.

212
00:27:02.660 --> 00:27:05.320
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Let let's call it this way. Um.

213
00:27:05.850 --> 00:27:08.389
Aleksandr Petrosyan: I think that as a habit

214
00:27:08.590 --> 00:27:10.710
Aleksandr Petrosyan: done precisely what they should have.

215
00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:13.909
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Um! Which is yours completely.

216
00:27:17.270 --> 00:27:25.759
Aleksandr Petrosyan: There's just There's just no way around this. Really, it's the way it's this: the the way that we have these by weekly meeting is

217
00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:30.539
Aleksandr Petrosyan: on the one hand, it is conducive to exchange of information. On the other hand,

218
00:27:31.410 --> 00:27:39.829
Aleksandr Petrosyan: we haven't had anything useful to share for a while, so them not showing up is actually beneficial. We're not wasting their time.

219
00:27:40.340 --> 00:27:41.330
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Um,

220
00:27:41.660 --> 00:27:45.709
Aleksandr Petrosyan: it. It's a different question whether or not. We're wasting our time, but I didn't think I am.

221
00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:52.850
Aleksandr Petrosyan: I would argue that i'm actually doing something completely. Um, actually perfectly useful in the context.

222
00:27:57.760 --> 00:28:01.069
Victor Gridnevsky: Well, I was looking for the text, but

223
00:28:01.420 --> 00:28:05.209
Victor Gridnevsky: with complete, awkward silence. It's not really possible

224
00:28:08.330 --> 00:28:09.380
Aleksandr Petrosyan: that's true.

225
00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:12.410
Victor Gridnevsky: Mhm

226
00:28:17.310 --> 00:28:18.379
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Then again,

227
00:28:19.540 --> 00:28:22.880
Aleksandr Petrosyan: we've done the backups. It's like a nice idea.

228
00:28:23.590 --> 00:28:24.830
Victor Gridnevsky: Yeah.

229
00:28:25.900 --> 00:28:27.150
Aleksandr Petrosyan: And now the

230
00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:28.890
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Cloud Providers.

231
00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:31.240
Aleksandr Petrosyan: I'm sure that you can't trust them.

232
00:28:34.210 --> 00:28:36.339
Aleksandr Petrosyan: I really don't know what i'm gonna do.

233
00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:40.880
Aleksandr Petrosyan: I mean, previously

234
00:28:41.430 --> 00:28:47.100
Aleksandr Petrosyan: my approach to this was um keep uh something on an external drive, just in case,

235
00:28:47.970 --> 00:28:49.320
Victor Gridnevsky: Mhm

236
00:28:49.540 --> 00:28:53.959
Aleksandr Petrosyan: and then keep some things on the flash drive

237
00:28:53.980 --> 00:28:55.740
Aleksandr Petrosyan: also, just in case

238
00:28:56.780 --> 00:29:04.480
Aleksandr Petrosyan: now, I probably need to buy another last drive, because um! The one I buy I bought for the archive purposes

239
00:29:04.670 --> 00:29:09.930
Aleksandr Petrosyan: is no longer used for archival purposes, because it's one gigabytes in size,

240
00:29:10.850 --> 00:29:12.819
Aleksandr Petrosyan: and I have a lot more than that.

241
00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:33.409
Aleksandr Petrosyan: There's an unreliable. Usb flash drive, which i'm afraid of using for archival purposes. Um! There's a hard disk drive which I external hard describe which I use for these purposes. But then, again, it can just get damaged along the way. And What do I do? And then the there's the question that we're using cloud providers, which,

242
00:29:33.650 --> 00:29:37.359
Aleksandr Petrosyan: as I have demonstrated, was completely stupid,

243
00:29:37.930 --> 00:29:50.809
Aleksandr Petrosyan: and I have no idea How am I gonna? How, how i'm gonna do it? I I really don't. It seems to me that I should probably set up our things scripts, which will, uh, you know, synchronize things to several

244
00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:53.300
Aleksandr Petrosyan: hosts,

245
00:29:53.660 --> 00:29:54.850
Victor Gridnevsky: you know

246
00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:58.119
Aleksandr Petrosyan: I should. I should definitely get a Ub key,

247
00:29:58.510 --> 00:29:59.700
Victor Gridnevsky: Mhm

248
00:30:00.270 --> 00:30:01.520
Aleksandr Petrosyan: probably two,

249
00:30:02.030 --> 00:30:03.700
Aleksandr Petrosyan: just in case I lose one.

250
00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:12.230
Victor Gridnevsky: What about what about?

251
00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:14.820
Aleksandr Petrosyan: So

252
00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:15.830
Aleksandr Petrosyan: okay?

253
00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:23.889
Aleksandr Petrosyan: My logic about this is as follows: Um, There are a few accounts which I can use to recover the rest.

254
00:30:24.590 --> 00:30:30.370
Aleksandr Petrosyan: So things where I've used my main email in case my email doesn't cost

255
00:30:30.820 --> 00:30:32.269
Aleksandr Petrosyan: um are gonna be fine.

256
00:30:33.930 --> 00:30:38.009
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Problem is that email is a Russian email and it will go bust.

257
00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:41.729
Aleksandr Petrosyan: It will go last time, and there's no doubt about it.

258
00:30:43.180 --> 00:30:47.900
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Um, in that case, having direct access to the passwords is good,

259
00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:50.840
Aleksandr Petrosyan: although not perfect.

260
00:30:50.890 --> 00:30:53.529
Aleksandr Petrosyan: I will also need icloud access,

261
00:30:54.300 --> 00:31:01.290
Aleksandr Petrosyan: which you can probably tell Isn't going to be simple. Given that it's reserved for icloud enabled devices

262
00:31:01.590 --> 00:31:05.710
Aleksandr Petrosyan: They're very expensive, and I own plan

263
00:31:05.750 --> 00:31:07.470
Aleksandr Petrosyan: an apple devices like everyone.

264
00:31:10.060 --> 00:31:22.420
Aleksandr Petrosyan: So the bigger question is, Can we come up with extremely reliable storage, which is going to be written to infrequently does not have any speed requirements, can be read from

265
00:31:22.460 --> 00:31:23.890
Aleksandr Petrosyan: very quickly,

266
00:31:24.050 --> 00:31:29.199
Aleksandr Petrosyan: and is reliable enough so that you don't need to um do it on back ups.

267
00:31:29.910 --> 00:31:37.249
Aleksandr Petrosyan: We answer, Yes, but it would require me to. Uh, actually, everybody stop me from

268
00:31:37.370 --> 00:31:38.390
um.

269
00:31:44.190 --> 00:31:47.529
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Actually, what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna order a Usb: flash drive.

270
00:31:47.690 --> 00:31:48.560
Victor Gridnevsky: Hmm.

271
00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:54.630
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Just another one, just in case this is a redundancy.

272
00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:55.950
Victor Gridnevsky: Mhm

273
00:31:57.680 --> 00:32:00.789
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Um, i'm going to be burning the roubles

274
00:32:02.650 --> 00:32:07.340
Aleksandr Petrosyan: and probably get something with a dual Usb. A Usbc.

275
00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:19.069
Aleksandr Petrosyan: There we go, flash still rich,

276
00:32:21.910 --> 00:32:23.950
Aleksandr Petrosyan: one hundred and twenty gigabytes.

277
00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:27.849
Aleksandr Petrosyan: That's good

278
00:32:28.520 --> 00:32:29.730
Victor Gridnevsky: Mhm.

279
00:32:30.860 --> 00:32:32.339
Aleksandr Petrosyan: It's really really good.

280
00:32:39.740 --> 00:32:42.029
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Get here by nineteenth of October.

281
00:32:42.520 --> 00:32:44.530
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Thirty megabytes a second.

282
00:32:46.420 --> 00:32:47.930
Aleksandr Petrosyan: You'll be to by now

283
00:32:52.180 --> 00:32:54.710
Aleksandr Petrosyan: not perfect. But what can you do?

284
00:33:12.630 --> 00:33:13.740
Victor Gridnevsky: So?

285
00:33:14.930 --> 00:33:24.340
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Yeah, let's let's just adjourn this meeting. Um. We have decided that they're not going to be doing any, So let's go. Let's

286
00:33:25.070 --> 00:33:27.609
right. Yep. Let's go to now.

287
00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:31.030
Victor Gridnevsky: Good. Now it is

288
00:33:49.210 --> 00:33:50.610
Victor Gridnevsky: Well,

289
00:34:07.060 --> 00:34:08.319
Victor Gridnevsky: i'm sure

290
00:34:13.580 --> 00:34:16.760
Victor Gridnevsky: you all know,

291
00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:21.389
Victor Gridnevsky: and

292
00:34:37.949 --> 00:34:39.130
Victor Gridnevsky: a lot

293
00:34:52.100 --> 00:34:53.040
Victor Gridnevsky: Okay,

294
00:35:06.830 --> 00:35:10.750
Victor Gridnevsky: um

295
00:35:16.860 --> 00:35:26.640
Victor Gridnevsky: lang.

296
00:35:34.430 --> 00:35:35.529
Victor Gridnevsky: Um,

297
00:35:35.620 --> 00:35:37.859
Victor Gridnevsky: what it costs

298
00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:45.169
