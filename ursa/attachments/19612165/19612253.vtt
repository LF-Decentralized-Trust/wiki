00:12:56.690 --> 00:12:58.100
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Now grew for me.

2
00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:04.150
Victor Gridnevsky: Hello!

3
00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:15.720
Dmitri Venger: Same same period

4
00:13:19.250 --> 00:13:21.359
Dmitri Venger: Aktoto's

5
00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:22.690
Dmitri Venger: invite

6
00:13:35.930 --> 00:13:37.070
Dmitri Venger: the voyager.

7
00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:38.320
Dmitri Venger: Hey, guys!

8
00:13:39.730 --> 00:13:40.820
Victor Gridnevsky: Hello,

9
00:13:44.070 --> 00:13:45.210
Dmitri Venger: Hello,

10
00:13:45.490 --> 00:13:46.840
Dmitri Venger: Hey, guys!

11
00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:50.200
Cam Parra: Hey, everyone!

12
00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:55.120
Cam Parra: We have a lot of people here today.

13
00:14:03.430 --> 00:14:06.499
Aleksandr Petrosyan: I kind of thought it was a good idea to bring

14
00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:11.049
Aleksandr Petrosyan: all three relevant people from our project.

15
00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:13.090
Cam Parra: Boom!

16
00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:15.690
Cam Parra: So we'll just give it a second, and we'll get started

17
00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:41.289
Cam Parra: all right um hard. Do you know, if Brent's coming? I do not.

18
00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:43.950
Hart Montgomery: I thought he was. But ah!

19
00:14:44.090 --> 00:14:46.680
Hart Montgomery: He said that like a week and a half ago.

20
00:14:47.810 --> 00:14:51.140
Cam Parra: Okay, so well, I have occurred like

21
00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:53.880
Hart Montgomery: very recently.

22
00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:57.060
Cam Parra: Well, if he comes in he comes in

23
00:14:58.330 --> 00:15:14.079
Cam Parra: all right. Well, yeah, everyone. Welcome to um the ersa uh by weekly meeting. Um, I'm Kampara, and uh, there's really run these meetings. Thank you. Everyone using you uh

24
00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:20.860
Cam Parra: we're showing up. Let's see. So does anyone want to introduce themselves, or

25
00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:23.629
Cam Parra: Ah, and tell us what they're working on?

26
00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:40.710
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Nice? I guess you should start with me. Hi, I'm. Alexander I'm. The technique of the second needle Hub and I also volunteered my help to improve hypologic also,

27
00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:45.760
Aleksandr Petrosyan: particularly to bring it up to a better standard of last code.

28
00:15:49.940 --> 00:16:00.150
Dmitri Venger: I believe it's my turn. Hi, everybody! My name is Dmitri, and i'm a project manager over Hattu, so i'm closely work with Alexander and Victor,

29
00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:14.669
Dmitri Venger: and it's my turn now. Hello! So i'm Victor. I'm a community manager. It's a mezzo and i'm monitoring this.

30
00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.719
Victor Gridnevsky: I really hope we can improve it.

31
00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:25.500
Aleksandr Petrosyan: But i'm on. He's one of our meeting developers,

32
00:16:28.890 --> 00:16:30.089
Cam Parra: it's it's it's it's, it's, it's, it's, it's it's, it's, it's it's, it's, it's, it's it's it's, it's, it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's It's it's

33
00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:32.520
Cam Parra: Well, thank you guys. Um,

34
00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:35.289
Cam Parra: i'm very excited to have you here

35
00:16:35.550 --> 00:16:46.899
Cam Parra: Um! So what it what so may I ask what exactly your company is using for? Are you guys using Indie with it? Um! What what do you? What are your plans with?

36
00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:06.349
Aleksandr Petrosyan: We are also using it directly as a static library inside of you know our version. Two

37
00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:09.710
Um. We have identified several,

38
00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:13.429
Aleksandr Petrosyan: and we are trying to resolve them.

39
00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:16.070
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Currently, we're using it for

40
00:17:16.190 --> 00:17:20.429
Aleksandr Petrosyan: from various state mandated encryption standards,

41
00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:30.970
Aleksandr Petrosyan: but also for all of our encryption needs and decryption needs basically everything related to S. A. Cp. To fifty, six K. One:

42
00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:35.080
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Well, as a address scheme,

43
00:17:38.430 --> 00:17:39.650
Cam Parra: cool

44
00:17:39.810 --> 00:17:45.790
Cam Parra: way cool. Yeah. Yeah. Sorry. I didn't catch that the first time. But you guys, are we in the middle of our team Wait: cool.

45
00:17:45.800 --> 00:18:04.089
Cam Parra: Yeah. And I saw an email from you guys that Um, you guys mentioned that there was some uh bug issues with or so that you'd like to fix. So wait cool. We can discuss it in a bit. Um. But yeah, um. So for the first item. We usually go over any pull requests

46
00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:20.769
Cam Parra: that are outstanding um currently. My uh pull request for um, for oso, or the first refactoring step is still on hold on my part, because I haven't been able to

47
00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:28.829
Cam Parra: ah solve those merge conflicts yet, but that's on my to do list. Um! Does anyone else have any other cool requests they would like to bring up.

48
00:18:29.710 --> 00:18:32.969
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Not at this time, and we won't have for a while.

49
00:18:33.310 --> 00:18:34.470
Cam Parra: Okay?

50
00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:35.890
Cam Parra: Ah, what about you, Brent?

51
00:18:37.540 --> 00:18:40.679
Brent Zundel: Ah, no, nothing for me. I've just been ah

52
00:18:41.490 --> 00:18:49.359
Brent Zundel: walked through with Mike last week. How to do how to do the release process. It's pretty straightforward,

53
00:18:49.390 --> 00:18:52.439
Brent Zundel: but was waiting for your Pr. To be in

54
00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:59.020
Brent Zundel: before initiating that. So just let me know when it's ready to hurt and we can move forward.

55
00:18:59.310 --> 00:19:00.969
Cam Parra: Okay, well do.

56
00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:17.979
Cam Parra: And yeah, just to note, we we do plan on releasing a newer version of ersa, that um may include some bug fixes. I'm not sure everything that's going to be ah released. I I'll have to probably note that down before we do the release.

57
00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:34.360
Cam Parra: Um. But yeah, that is coming down the pipeline. So if any one has anything that they need to get in, or um would want to see in this next version, that's definitely something that um you can speak to me about, and we'll try to get. We'll try to get that in

58
00:19:35.770 --> 00:19:37.190
Aleksandr Petrosyan: all right.

59
00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:39.960
I think trade-off version bumps would be a good start.

60
00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:53.249
Cam Parra: Cool. Um, Yeah. And so let's see what other some agenda items here. Um,

61
00:19:53.690 --> 00:20:01.770
Cam Parra: we're still we still Haven't. Oh, actually, we're you, Brent. We're able to talk to Mike about the

62
00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:07.470
the fix for the current security issue that we have.

63
00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:12.470
Brent Zundel: Ah, just briefly, he's

64
00:20:13.030 --> 00:20:14.690
Brent Zundel: hoping that

65
00:20:14.790 --> 00:20:17.410
Brent Zundel: he'll have time and the ability to

66
00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:18.879
Brent Zundel: to put it in.

67
00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:20.889
Brent Zundel: But I have to

68
00:20:21.190 --> 00:20:24.440
Brent Zundel: to talk with them some more about that, because they didn't get

69
00:20:24.450 --> 00:20:26.110
Brent Zundel: a firm resolution.

70
00:20:26.690 --> 00:20:27.990
Cam Parra: Okay, cool.

71
00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:43.800
Cam Parra: And for everyone who's here. There's a current ah security issue that we have been working on on ersa um having to do with. I guess we we've already published this. So all right. We haven't put published the the security. Um, sa, but we have

72
00:20:43.810 --> 00:20:50.279
Cam Parra: talked about it with other groups. But um, yeah, the security issue here

73
00:20:50.390 --> 00:21:10.029
Cam Parra: uh has to do with how we generate primes in, and how we um, and to check if those primes are safe crimes or not. And so we are currently working on a solution. We have a solution. We're currently working on the code. We're trying to get that released as soon as possible.

74
00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:18.679
Cam Parra: I don't know, and I. Roha, you guys do more of iot or more things on on mobile right?

75
00:21:19.610 --> 00:21:22.230
Aleksandr Petrosyan: No, we're actually doing crypto.

76
00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:29.390
Cam Parra: So yeah, just just to be clear, though the vulnerability is just with the cl signature

77
00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:35.230
Cam Parra: scheme, it's not a Okay, Yeah, nothing beyond that.

78
00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:39.390
Hart Montgomery: Yeah, it's not going to be anything you're using for a roha, and it's

79
00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:41.529
Hart Montgomery: uh it's a

80
00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:47.590
Hart Montgomery: it's not a it's it's not especially severe in what

81
00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:50.179
Hart Montgomery: it enables an adversary to do

82
00:21:50.420 --> 00:21:51.780
Aleksandr Petrosyan: um,

83
00:21:52.420 --> 00:21:54.010
Hart Montgomery: but it

84
00:21:54.660 --> 00:21:59.849
Hart Montgomery: we can go through it if you want, but it doesn't. It shouldn't affect what you're doing.

85
00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:05.049
Hart Montgomery: It's not in a part of the library you're using for A.

86
00:22:06.230 --> 00:22:09.189
Aleksandr Petrosyan: We might eventually start using it.

87
00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:11.480
Aleksandr Petrosyan: I would.

88
00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:15.769
Hart Montgomery: I would encourage you to use Nancy. Hell signatures.

89
00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:17.080
Hart Montgomery: Ah,

90
00:22:17.540 --> 00:22:22.739
Hart Montgomery: like bbs plus is a much better choice these days for just about anything.

91
00:22:23.350 --> 00:22:29.070
Hart Montgomery: But if you want, if you want to use these kinds of things, we should have a longer chat at some point

92
00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:33.330
Aleksandr Petrosyan: all right. That makes a bit of sense.

93
00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:41.740
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Um: yeah, Come to think that there was a small let's just say inconvenience. We noticed that one of the functions which

94
00:22:41.950 --> 00:22:46.590
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Okay? Well, when we're trying to generate a new public private keeper.

95
00:22:46.780 --> 00:22:48.110
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Um!

96
00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:52.240
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Almost all the algorithms except for one

97
00:22:52.590 --> 00:22:53.680
Aleksandr Petrosyan: um

98
00:22:53.910 --> 00:23:03.629
Aleksandr Petrosyan: use the seed and then hash it and then return that, except for one which actually requires the C. To be an exact set number of bites, and then more and no less,

99
00:23:04.050 --> 00:23:11.280
Aleksandr Petrosyan: I think Victor identified it. And then Roman pointed at the piece of code in the

100
00:23:12.270 --> 00:23:14.840
and we've changed and fixed.

101
00:23:17.180 --> 00:23:20.369
Aleksandr Petrosyan: So whenever you do release the um

102
00:23:20.750 --> 00:23:26.329
Aleksandr Petrosyan: call request. Can you just ping me personally and get to them to the chat

103
00:23:26.690 --> 00:23:29.390
Aleksandr Petrosyan: so we could add the actual things as well.

104
00:23:36.390 --> 00:23:45.800
Cam Parra: Great? Does anyone else have any comments on that. Um, I personally wasn't aware of that. But that's something that's great to keep on the radar.

105
00:23:45.810 --> 00:23:54.420
Cam Parra: And yeah, if you guys have the fix and have the code if you want to do A. Pr: That's that's great. I'm glad to merge that.

106
00:23:56.030 --> 00:23:57.330
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Thank you.

107
00:23:59.190 --> 00:24:00.780
Cam Parra: How about the energy?

108
00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:02.460
Cam Parra: So you go ahead, Jim,

109
00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:07.939
Cam Parra: you can go ahead, or I was just gonna ask Alexander if you had any roadmap issues you want to bring up

110
00:24:09.740 --> 00:24:15.850
Aleksandr Petrosyan: in terms of. Do you want me to give you the full road map or just a few suggestions.

111
00:24:16.010 --> 00:24:18.279
Hart Montgomery: What's up to you?

112
00:24:18.430 --> 00:24:19.560
Hart Montgomery: Um,

113
00:24:19.740 --> 00:24:22.520
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Um, right. So um!

114
00:24:23.060 --> 00:24:28.410
Aleksandr Petrosyan: And unfortunately our last meeting was without pros of Mr. Para, the

115
00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:33.189
Aleksandr Petrosyan: so we did not have a chance to.

116
00:24:37.860 --> 00:24:40.809
Aleksandr Petrosyan: So from now on i'm, thankfully, this is not the case.

117
00:24:41.660 --> 00:24:42.860
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Um!

118
00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:44.590
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Um!

119
00:24:44.630 --> 00:24:49.589
Aleksandr Petrosyan: There were a few suggestions as to how we could make us a better in terms of

120
00:24:49.750 --> 00:24:53.059
Aleksandr Petrosyan: not just being a cryptographic library, but also good rust library. So

121
00:24:53.830 --> 00:24:59.450
Aleksandr Petrosyan: there were a few suggestions that we made, particularly in terms of how to modularize it,

122
00:25:04.950 --> 00:25:06.690
Aleksandr Petrosyan: which,

123
00:25:08.020 --> 00:25:13.999
Aleksandr Petrosyan: in terms of being functional in the rickety way it does the job, but it's

124
00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:19.030
Aleksandr Petrosyan: it doesn't blend itself easy to tr your fixes.

125
00:25:21.170 --> 00:25:29.280
Aleksandr Petrosyan: It's rather difficult to figure out. Where and how do you track in new version of an all dependency.

126
00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:33.870
Aleksandr Petrosyan: But most of these dependencies are optional, and so on and so forth.

127
00:25:42.390 --> 00:25:45.999
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Avoid recompilation of Ursa, and make it

128
00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:54.240
Aleksandr Petrosyan: consist of a few pluggable modules. It will also allow you to extract the common code and not have it be

129
00:25:55.820 --> 00:25:59.099
Aleksandr Petrosyan: so. The problem that we talked about in terms of the seed

130
00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:03.929
arises from the that, but each library has its own implementation of

131
00:26:03.940 --> 00:26:05.450
Aleksandr Petrosyan: how to accept the seat.

132
00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:09.920
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Doesn't. Follow a common interface, and it can't follow a common interface, because

133
00:26:09.950 --> 00:26:13.169
Aleksandr Petrosyan: the configuration directives might disable all of them.

134
00:26:13.570 --> 00:26:16.539
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Um! In that case it becomes unusable, and so on, and so forth.

135
00:26:17.130 --> 00:26:26.089
Aleksandr Petrosyan: A few suggestions for how to improve the testing, particularly the usage of all features, to test different feature combinations.

136
00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:29.260
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Ideally, they wouldn't be necessary because

137
00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:36.300
Aleksandr Petrosyan: because of a new modular design. It would be trivial. It would not require testing, would just work.

138
00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:38.020
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Um! But again

139
00:26:38.670 --> 00:26:41.460
Aleksandr Petrosyan: depends on what you want to do.

140
00:26:42.280 --> 00:26:51.060
Aleksandr Petrosyan: We also had a few ideas about regular testing of particularly i'm introducing property-based testing,

141
00:26:52.680 --> 00:27:02.759
Aleksandr Petrosyan: considering that person does not involve any multi-process and multi-threaded applications, and is a collection of algorithms

142
00:27:03.390 --> 00:27:15.650
Aleksandr Petrosyan: it lends itself perfectly to property-based testing In general, it will allow you to improve the coverage quite significantly. More importantly, it would allow you to identify bugs before they happen

143
00:27:15.950 --> 00:27:18.070
Aleksandr Petrosyan: property-based testing as a habits of the

144
00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:21.539
Aleksandr Petrosyan: identifying bugs, which you wouldn't even think to test for

145
00:27:22.810 --> 00:27:24.060
Aleksandr Petrosyan: um

146
00:27:24.110 --> 00:27:32.409
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Aside from that, we have a few other ideas for how to we organize those. I have to wait until after the remodelization.

147
00:27:33.610 --> 00:27:41.290
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Of course we we assume that we are the only ones carrying this out, we would be happy to share the precise roadmap.

148
00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:49.309
Aleksandr Petrosyan: There's also a few small questions about dependencies which

149
00:27:51.590 --> 00:27:55.969
Aleksandr Petrosyan: one of the reasons why we got in touch with Rye, who got in touch with

150
00:27:56.100 --> 00:27:57.879
Aleksandr Petrosyan: um heart. And Brent

151
00:27:58.420 --> 00:28:04.080
Aleksandr Petrosyan: was because we identified a problem with Ae.

152
00:28:04.470 --> 00:28:09.359
Aleksandr Petrosyan: The fact that, as I was using a very old version of it a semantically incompatible one

153
00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:17.550
Aleksandr Petrosyan: we wanted to just limit ourselves to was a trivial version, but it was not easy to do

154
00:28:19.110 --> 00:28:27.829
Aleksandr Petrosyan: um. I'm guessing that if um Devops engineers gave you a hand with setting up automatic dependency updating,

155
00:28:28.060 --> 00:28:29.830
Aleksandr Petrosyan: that would also be ample.

156
00:28:34.730 --> 00:28:53.899
Cam Parra: Yeah, Um. So yeah. So let me tell you. Uh, Alexander. Um. So basically the current state what we have is that most of us here are volunteers are: Um, So i'm personally a volunteer. Um, and I don't get paid for. Uh, you know the the work that I do.

157
00:28:53.910 --> 00:29:13.590
Cam Parra: Um. So basically we're all limited here for a couple of hours a week or every two weeks to to work on this. So I would say that if you have a roadmap, if you have a plan for modularity that is different from the ticket that's on the repo. Then project also

158
00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:17.249
Cam Parra: would welcome that. I just. Yeah, I think we should.

159
00:29:17.260 --> 00:29:36.590
Cam Parra: I think you should just bring it up as you um like. Let's say, in two weeks, or whenever we have our next ah meeting, we like every all the members are presented with it. We agree with it on it, and we carry it out, and then you guys are free to carry it out.

160
00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:52.640
Cam Parra: Yeah, I don't. I don't see an issue with that. I Yeah, I think it's very welcomed. Um, We do understand that the code is old. The rust is very old. I I was there when it was written. I I didn't personally write it, but it was um

161
00:29:52.650 --> 00:30:05.140
Cam Parra: Ah, but it is very early. Rust and rust has grown a lot. So we understand that it it does need an update so totally. Get all those all those points. And

162
00:30:05.310 --> 00:30:17.540
Cam Parra: um, yeah, if you want, if this is Ah, if if if your modularity changes are to benefit I, Roha first, we totally understand and

163
00:30:17.550 --> 00:30:31.890
Cam Parra: welcome that. And I Yeah, we have been looking at changing everything to be into a common library and breaking it up into individual libraries, so that we don't have these dependency issues for a while. But we just Haven't had the bandwidth to do it,

164
00:30:35.940 --> 00:30:37.140
Aleksandr Petrosyan: so I

165
00:30:37.540 --> 00:30:44.370
Hart Montgomery: So maybe the thing to do is if Alexander, if you could post this like detailed roadmap as an issue.

166
00:30:46.190 --> 00:30:47.270
Hart Montgomery: Um,

167
00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:54.090
Aleksandr Petrosyan: right. Does that make sense to everybody that way like I know we we talked earlier about not

168
00:30:54.440 --> 00:31:03.759
Hart Montgomery: wanting to unnecessarily inconvenience people that were using the library. And I think just you know, if we just post that is

169
00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:11.540
Hart Montgomery: an issue, and we just socialize that and say, Hey, this is what's gonna happen, you know, like

170
00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:18.810
Hart Montgomery: you have a problem, or if this is like breaking something in some non-obvious way, please let us know you.

171
00:31:18.940 --> 00:31:20.900
Hart Montgomery: And then you know

172
00:31:22.620 --> 00:31:26.490
Hart Montgomery: you know, short review period, You know, we we assume we're good to go.

173
00:31:26.550 --> 00:31:28.270
Hart Montgomery: Does Does that seem reasonable?

174
00:31:30.900 --> 00:31:44.279
Cam Parra: Yeah, that seems reasonable to me. Um. Another thing that that I thought a while while we were sitting. That hard is that we can have a Development branch that I don't think we currently have in ersa and start

175
00:31:44.290 --> 00:32:00.469
Cam Parra: pushing those changes to that development branch, release, development. Ah, development! Ah artifacts, and then marge those into Maine so that people will have at least a a bit of a buffering time, but that's not exactly necessary. That's just a I just suggestion. There.

176
00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:12.479
Aleksandr Petrosyan: I'm. I'm pleasing this night. It might be a good idea,

177
00:32:13.330 --> 00:32:17.930
Aleksandr Petrosyan: so that we're not stepping on each other's toes, for example, and not breaking the code

178
00:32:21.510 --> 00:32:36.680
Cam Parra: right, I think right now the biggest users they have to worry about is is Indie and Aries that that depend on these libraries. And of course, you guys that that So those are like the three groups that that currently use it that we're aware of.

179
00:32:43.270 --> 00:33:01.019
Cam Parra: So maybe uh, maybe I I can take that down as a note. Maybe in two weeks I can bring in some Aries uh and Indie representatives that can hear about this roadmap and be aware of it. I don't know if that sounds like a good idea to you guys.

180
00:33:01.030 --> 00:33:06.469
Hart Montgomery: Can Can we do this as offline as possible? So i'd prefer, like, you know, we don't want to

181
00:33:07.350 --> 00:33:12.619
Hart Montgomery: to to to move more quickly. I'd prefer if we had Alexander like

182
00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:15.719
Hart Montgomery: or someone post the issues,

183
00:33:16.010 --> 00:33:22.179
Hart Montgomery: then, you know, we can have a meeting where we bring up everything. But I would. I'd prefer to do this like

184
00:33:22.370 --> 00:33:27.589
Hart Montgomery: as asynchronously as possible. So they're not seeing the stuff for the first time in the meeting.

185
00:33:28.820 --> 00:33:41.689
Cam Parra: Okay, Great: Yeah. So if you want to post that issue, I will, and if you can post it in the discord on the hash ersa discord whenever you get that done.

186
00:33:41.700 --> 00:33:52.529
Cam Parra: Um. Then I can just tag some Indie folks, or maybe Thendy folks will see it themselves, and if a meeting is necessary, then we'll. We'll bring it to the next meeting.

187
00:33:53.170 --> 00:33:58.919
Hart Montgomery: Yeah, I mean, if we do need to talk about it, I we can. But I mean, I highly doubt we will.

188
00:33:58.990 --> 00:34:16.589
Cam Parra: Yeah, I I I don't know if people if if people like Stephen Koran or others, I I just haven't been in in that community for a while, so I don't know if anyone has. If Ah concerns or or or well, they'll probably just be happy about it. But I don't, I think. Yeah,

189
00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:19.090
Hart Montgomery: I think they'll be very happy and grateful.

190
00:34:19.100 --> 00:34:21.909
Cam Parra: Yeah, I'm sure that that's the case. So

191
00:34:21.969 --> 00:34:35.859
Cam Parra: So yeah, if if if needed, we can bring those people in like eventually. But right now we can do as a asynchronous as possible. So that's what i'm saying. Yeah, I would. They may have minor suggestions, but I wouldn't expect any show stoppers.

192
00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:43.790
Cam Parra: Yeah. Well, if you're not writing the code, then I guess you don't have that much to say. That's how we usually treat things here.

193
00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:46.269
Cam Parra: Absolutely. It's a dualocracy.

194
00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:47.179
Yeah,

195
00:34:47.190 --> 00:34:54.659
Brent Zundel: some folks are where I did ping the identity channel in the discord as well to let them know that they should anticipate some

196
00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:57.509
Brent Zundel: potentially major changes over the next few months.

197
00:34:59.470 --> 00:35:15.790
Cam Parra: Yeah. And if they want to keep, if they want to work with you guys, yeah, they'll they'll probably contact you. Um: because yeah, I I don't again. I don't know the state, but they were working on the A non-cred stuff. And then they um

198
00:35:15.890 --> 00:35:19.929
Cam Parra: yeah. They still depend heavily on cl signatures, As I'm aware,

199
00:35:26.020 --> 00:35:28.699
Hart Montgomery: you're right. They do still use cl signatures.

200
00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:36.089
Cam Parra: I should probably go to some of those meetings sometimes, and then catch up. But

201
00:35:36.100 --> 00:35:52.520
Cam Parra: yeah, any questions, any concerns. I think you guys are free to do as much work as you want. We're definitely not going to hold you back. Ah, me! And Brent and I don't know if our actually is able to any more since he works at Hyper Ledger. But we are,

202
00:35:52.530 --> 00:36:03.269
Cam Parra: uh we? We were always checking. Ah, Prs Brend gets to them faster than I do. So Yeah. But we're there to help you merge, and

203
00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:13.979
Cam Parra: we can. Yeah, once we see some pull requests, I'm: sure we can talk about also getting you some someone on your team that can review and merge things on as well,

204
00:36:14.270 --> 00:36:17.960
Hart Montgomery: we should add some of the these folks as maintainers. Yeah,

205
00:36:17.970 --> 00:36:32.249
Cam Parra: right? Um, That's something that we could probably. Yeah, as as as we go along we can, We can do. Ah, probably next meeting. I don't know if that's too long of a weight. But or if you would like to do that faster, hard.

206
00:36:33.070 --> 00:36:34.879
Hart Montgomery: Well, it's up to these guys.

207
00:36:36.380 --> 00:36:43.390
Aleksandr Petrosyan: We wouldn't be able to do much with the containership. Anyway, we are in the middle of a large release

208
00:36:44.070 --> 00:36:49.949
Aleksandr Petrosyan: next week. I think we'll have something to do, so there's no need to Russia,

209
00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:04.090
Cam Parra: maybe A. Pr. About it and let the other maintainers know the ones who don't come to the

210
00:37:04.270 --> 00:37:16.849
Cam Parra: to the calls, and let them give them a little bit of a of of time to not a lot of time, but like just had heads up that we're going to be adding new people. So they don't freak out

211
00:37:17.640 --> 00:37:20.859
Cam Parra: uh they shouldn't because they they're not very active. So.

212
00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:22.940
Cam Parra: Um. But yeah,

213
00:37:25.100 --> 00:37:27.299
Cam Parra: any other questions or concerns

214
00:37:30.510 --> 00:37:32.080
Aleksandr Petrosyan: none from our side.

215
00:37:37.470 --> 00:37:48.749
Cam Parra: Well, are there any topics that anyone would like to bring up any crypto that they would like to discuss heart. Do you have anything that you'd like to bring up from your crypto? Two thousand and twenty-two.

216
00:37:50.070 --> 00:37:52.229
Hart Montgomery: Ah, I don't know I've

217
00:37:54.570 --> 00:37:58.569
Hart Montgomery: uh what? What's interesting uh isogeny, Scott broke in.

218
00:37:58.870 --> 00:38:00.080
Hart Montgomery: He's,

219
00:38:00.190 --> 00:38:02.190
and not just a little broken like

220
00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:03.700
Brent Zundel: completely broken.

221
00:38:03.710 --> 00:38:05.710
Hart Montgomery: Yeah, Basically,

222
00:38:08.780 --> 00:38:11.669
Hart Montgomery: at least the efficient versions of the scheme did.

223
00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:19.350
Hart Montgomery: There's a lot of work on the sort of simpler Pdfs the Rf's: I talked to the

224
00:38:19.910 --> 00:38:25.419
Hart Montgomery: I talked to. Yeah. I talked. I gave like a short rum session talk about the

225
00:38:26.830 --> 00:38:33.960
Hart Montgomery: the need for solving more practical problems, and i'm hoping to get some people interested in designing

226
00:38:34.190 --> 00:38:37.250
Hart Montgomery: verifiable and anonymous credential schemes.

227
00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:41.449
Hart Montgomery: I had a long talk with Anna. License Gaia

228
00:38:42.030 --> 00:38:45.539
Hart Montgomery: um! I've already introduced her to Kalia

229
00:38:46.990 --> 00:38:51.789
Hart Montgomery: and some other people so so hopefully. This will will lead to some interesting stuff.

230
00:38:52.130 --> 00:38:53.250
Hart Montgomery: Um!

231
00:38:54.970 --> 00:38:59.500
Hart Montgomery: What else? Uh, Brent, you? You'll be amused to know that the uh,

232
00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:05.490
Hart Montgomery: the best rum session talk which you have won before at an Icr conference.

233
00:39:07.420 --> 00:39:21.860
Brent Zundel: It was won by a man who got Ah, who was attempting to give a a serious talk, but Ah had too much to drink beforehand. It gave an unintentionally hilarious talk i'd recommend i'd highly recommend watching it.

234
00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:23.290
Brent Zundel: I

235
00:39:23.450 --> 00:39:25.029
Brent Zundel: character

236
00:39:25.040 --> 00:39:27.089
i'm regretting visiting the conferences here.

237
00:39:27.100 --> 00:39:29.089
Hart Montgomery: Yeah, there was a

238
00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:35.270
Hart Montgomery: Um, and it was, I guess Nadia and Paul grabs who

239
00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:39.889
Hart Montgomery: I watch it online, if you can. It's really funny.

240
00:39:41.250 --> 00:39:43.739
Cam Parra: I didn't think Crypto got this crazy.

241
00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:56.529
Hart Montgomery: Ah, well, you know, in the Eightys it was wild enough that they had it. They had to institute a rule, saying that you were only allowed to throw empty beer cans at the speakers, not full ones.

242
00:39:57.290 --> 00:39:59.040
That's fine.

243
00:39:59.340 --> 00:40:02.149
Hart Montgomery: That happened that if you talk to like,

244
00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:09.139
Hart Montgomery: if you talk to like Whit Diffey or Chaffee Goldwater, or all these old people. They'll They'll tell you about it.

245
00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:14.240
Cam Parra: I'm not so sad that I missed it.

246
00:40:15.610 --> 00:40:22.100
Hart Montgomery: Yeah, it's good to have everybody back. My back hurts from sleeping in the Ucsb dorms. But

247
00:40:24.330 --> 00:40:27.819
Cam Parra: those dorms don't accommodate for tall people.

248
00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:34.109
Hart Montgomery: Yeah, I'm. I'm too old, and my body's too, broken for the

249
00:40:34.810 --> 00:40:37.180
Hart Montgomery: of life.

250
00:40:39.850 --> 00:40:46.370
Hart Montgomery: But the Brent is this something you're going to get to? Are you going to have the opportunity in the future to do these kind of things.

251
00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:52.699
Brent Zundel: I it's definitely on my list to do. Real-world crypto

252
00:40:52.890 --> 00:40:55.590
Brent Zundel: Gotcha awesome. Where is this here?

253
00:40:55.750 --> 00:40:59.939
Brent Zundel: It's gonna be in Tokyo? Oh, interesting.

254
00:41:00.110 --> 00:41:01.600
Yeah, The next works,

255
00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:03.270
Brent Zundel: madam,

256
00:41:03.450 --> 00:41:04.640
Brent Zundel: hey?

257
00:41:04.710 --> 00:41:09.109
Brent Zundel: I honestly don't know, because in by the end of September,

258
00:41:09.270 --> 00:41:20.090

Cam Parra: Gotcha, Thank you. So we we need to move it earlier, Let us know. And we we did used to meet an hour earlier, so I think most of us can make it. I don't know if heart will be too happy or or Brent.

282
00:43:44.700 --> 00:43:54.039
Brent Zundel: I can probably make it. My schedule is always a mess these days. Anyway, I could never be sure I can make anything an hour earlier would be fine for me

283
00:43:54.090 --> 00:44:04.250
Brent Zundel: exactly. It still throws me off the Abbrey on Wednesday to go. Oh, wait! It's at nine now, so I still have it in that i'm supposed to be,

284
00:44:04.440 --> 00:44:17.790
Brent Zundel: and i'll be at T-pac um if we move in an hour earlier, then I might be able to come. If not, I mean it's going to be if you either way, whether i'll be able to show up next week. But

285
00:44:17.800 --> 00:44:25.590
Cam Parra: and two weeks is the global forum. So i'm not going to be able to come for sure. Okay, yes, I will have the cancel. I'll probably cancel it for next week.

286
00:44:25.600 --> 00:44:35.299
Brent Zundel: Well, if if we have stuff we can have, We We can work asynchronously, and if we, you know, if you want to have a meeting like, have a meeting.

287
00:44:36.050 --> 00:44:54.150
Brent Zundel: But there's stuff you can get done, and there are people there like, by all means, and we need to inform someone from Ursa about some issue we found. Where do we

288
00:44:54.160 --> 00:45:10.989
Brent Zundel: A discord is probably the best. Ah, so yeah, it cam and bread. What do you think discords? Okay, if it's, if if there's any way to do it is there's an existing issue, or Pr. And it comes through Github, then, that

289
00:45:11.120 --> 00:45:15.010
Brent Zundel: that reaches me sooner than discord does, because

290
00:45:15.130 --> 00:45:17.259
Brent Zundel: I can't mute any

291
00:45:17.820 --> 00:45:33.280
Brent Zundel: channels in discord, so everything shows up as I need to read it, and it's impossible for me to sort through. So um if i'm pinged directly in discord. I'll probably see it. I'm also happy to receive emails directly.

292
00:45:33.990 --> 00:45:36.369
Brent Zundel: But my yeah,

293
00:45:36.580 --> 00:45:44.410
Hart Montgomery: Victor, if you want speed, if you want speed email people directly or tag them in Github.

294
00:45:45.140 --> 00:45:46.869
Victor Gridnevsky: Okay, Thank you.

295
00:45:49.110 --> 00:46:00.960
Cam Parra: Yeah, that thing for me, I would, I would say email and uh Github are the fastest ways. Uh we'll send me an email. So that's how you I usually see it quicker than discord.

296
00:46:01.400 --> 00:46:06.830
Victor Gridnevsky: Yeah, I yeah email is the fastest for me. I am tagged on like,

297
00:46:07.530 --> 00:46:11.039
Hart Montgomery: probably literally thousands of github things

298
00:46:11.300 --> 00:46:12.550
Cam Parra: a day.

299
00:46:12.970 --> 00:46:14.049

303
00:46:23.700 --> 00:46:24.689
Victor Gridnevsky: here. Um,

Hart Montgomery: And like I'm going to be most useful about like

305
00:46:29.780 --> 00:46:32.319
Hart Montgomery: cryptography questions themselves. The

306
00:46:33.110 --> 00:46:37.930
Hart Montgomery: Cam and Brent are going to be better with the coding and the interface questions.
