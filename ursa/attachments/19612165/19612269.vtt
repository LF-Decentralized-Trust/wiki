00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:34.969
Nathan George: Oh, hello.

2
00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:39.110
Bhaskar Ram: hey! Hello!

3
00:00:42.930 --> 00:01:02.550
Nathan George: Welcome to the we usually wait a couple of minutes to see who else is is on their way. I don't know if we have a current call leader right now. But Brent is here, so at least there are some community members here to talk to. So if you have any ideas on what you'd like to talk about now, it's the time to kind of think about them. so we can see what topics we have to discuss.

4
00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:04.750
Bhaskar Ram: Okay.

5
00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.550
Bhaskar Ram: Hey, Nathan? Hey, George?

6
00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:54.220
Bhaskar Ram: Hello!

7
00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.040
Nathan George: Hello! Hello!

8
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.749
Nathan George: Well, it looks like it's probably just the 3 of us for today.

9
00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:28.629
Nathan George: We actually don't have a pre prepared agenda for the call today, as far as I know, i'm looking on discord. Now, just to make sure that that's actually the case.

10
00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.330
Nathan George: if you are on hyper ledger discord.

11
00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:43.560
Nathan George: there is an Ursa channel there on hyper ledger discord that we can use to discuss anything related to the code base and what's going on in the project, or in some cases, what's not going on in the project.

12
00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:45.990
Bhaskar Ram: Okay.

13
00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.060
Bhaskar Ram: I'm: actually

14
00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.040
Bhaskar Ram: working on

15
00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.930
Bhaskar Ram: cactus.

16
00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:54.360
Nathan George: Excellent!

17
00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.909
Bhaskar Ram: Just learning about the all the projects. Now.

18
00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:15.540
Nathan George: well, with Ersa is a shared cryptography library that was intended originally to be used very heavily in both saw tooth and in

19
00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:34.600
Nathan George: hyper ledger. Indie it's a Since then some of the the constructs inside it have grown to be able to support other systems as well, though I don't know how well it was adopted in Saw Tooth code base. It's very extensively used by the hyper ledger Indie community to build both hyper ledger indie, and later Hyper ledger aries

20
00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:39.930
Nathan George: and also we hope is a continued component of the new Hyper ledger, non-cret initiatives.

21
00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:46.380
Nathan George: And so there's a lot of anonymous credentials implementation inside of ersa. There's also a lot

22
00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:52.209
Nathan George: primitives for signing and encryption and decryption that are useful for various blockchain applications.

23
00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:58.360
Nathan George: it has suffered recently from the lack of a lot of active contribution.

24
00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:04.520
Nathan George: largely because, most of the code that's being actually used in other projects is fairly stable, and

25
00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:08.079
Nathan George: the contributors to those projects have been focused on other areas

26
00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:09.260
Nathan George: their tech stack.

27
00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:16.500
Nathan George: So one of the things we've been looking for is more contributors to help update the rust packaging code organization, the unit testing

28
00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:36.079
Nathan George: and then get into what the next future enhancements are that the community would like to see so this call has been actually rather poorly attended. The last 3 or 4 times that it's occurred since cam needed to step down the company i'm with keep it. Microphones Used to be very heavily involved in

29
00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:37.170
Nathan George: global

30
00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:46.679
Nathan George: national Id cards and development of Id cards that could be used for financial inclusion around the world. And since my company has stepped away from a direct Content

31
00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:52.490
Nathan George: Hyper ledger, there's been a lot of contribution from Kam and myself in particular.

32
00:04:52.510 --> 00:05:08.979
Nathan George: and a couple of other contributors had similar situations come up. So we're happy to have everyone who's here on the call here today. and the the time is essentially Q. A. to talk about whatever we would like to talk about, so I I turn it over to you.

33
00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:12.160
Nathan George: Oh, Brent, is it? Is it? Pascar?

34
00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:13.640
Bhaskar Ram: Yeah.

35
00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:18.040
Bhaskar Ram: Hello.

36
00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:21.750
Bhaskar Ram: Hey, George!

37
00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:26.579
Nathan George: Oh, my! My last name is George. I usually go by Nathan.

38
00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:33.600
Bhaskar Ram: Yeah, I actually contributed to some security issues and cactus on fabric

39
00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:34.680
Bhaskar Ram: that way.

40
00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:38.220
Nathan George: Excellent!

41
00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:42.940
Bhaskar Ram: I would like to interested in researching on also

42
00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:51.659
Nathan George: the folks on Ursa tend to come from a lot of different companies. We haven't had a

43
00:05:51.730 --> 00:06:09.209
Nathan George: one unified corporate effort on Ursa for a while. We tend to have more kind of freelance developers. In the past this meeting has been a really good source of advice around cryptography and the design of crypto systems. It's one of the things we've always used. The the zoom call for and then

44
00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:22.859
Nathan George: Most of the coding effort has happened on Github through Github issues. in terms of the coordination and there's been a lot of full request review on the various 4 requests that have happened. The the team that has been working on Hero Ha

45
00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:27.169
Nathan George: has recently tried to get more involved with ersa and has been

46
00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:31.109
Nathan George: we're hoping putting themselves in a position to take over as primary maintainer.

47
00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:34.529
Bhaskar Ram: Yeah, I would like to also contribute to the

48
00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:39.350
Bhaskar Ram: Yeah. Yeah, I'm: a freelance developer at.

49
00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:44.569
Nathan George: So do you work with

50
00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:51.909
Nathan George: Which teams have you been working with on cactus

51
00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:54.280
Bhaskar Ram: like security?

52
00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:56.180
Nathan George: Excellent.

53
00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:57.230
Yeah.

54
00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:03.159
Bhaskar Ram: We can continue this meeting.

55
00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:11.149
Nathan George: Well, do you have any particular questions in particular about Ursa, or what you would like to do to

56
00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:16.999
Bhaskar Ram: Oh, no, nothing. I will check it out. Letter from Docs, or something like

57
00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:29.889
Nathan George: the the Docs folder has some description of what's going on there's actually a current issue in it's kind of a master ticket for what we call operation oso

58
00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:39.309
Nathan George: that has a bunch of smaller refactoring tasks in it. So if you're looking for an easy way to kind of get a full request in and get a kind of a tour of the code base. That's probably where I would start.

59
00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:42.190
Bhaskar Ram: Yeah, that seems to be good

60
00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:48.079
Nathan George: branch. Do you have anything else to add or anything you'd like to talk about today.

61
00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:49.670
Bhaskar Ram: No, nothing.

62
00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:52.760
Brent Zundel: I don't have anything either.

63
00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:58.280
Nathan George: Well, then, I guess this is going to be a really short meeting.

64
00:07:58.720 --> 00:07:59.849
Brent Zundel: Those are my favorite.

65
00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:06.559
Brent Zundel: all right. I'll see everybody in January.

66
00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:12.540
Nathan George: Excellent! We'll. We'll see everybody at the next call, which, like Brent said should be in January, will likely

67
00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:22.430
Nathan George: have canceled the the calls during the holiday season, and if that call doesn't get officially canceled, at least in this recording we can say on the record that it's unofficially canceled at the very least.

68
00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:25.350
Nathan George: Thank you.

69
00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:27.370
Bhaskar Ram: Thank you, Brandon. Not on.

70
00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:31.760
Bhaskar Ram: thank you. Guys. Bye.

71
00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:33.310
Nathan George: bye, bye.

72
00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:34.740
Bhaskar Ram: all right.

73
00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:35.580
Bhaskar Ram: Good morning.

74
00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:37.010
Bhaskar Ram: I mean.
