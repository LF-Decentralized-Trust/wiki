00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.260
Brent Zundel: hey heart, I just saw that cam canceled the meeting.

2
00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.510
Hart Montgomery: Okay.

3
00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:40.140
Brent Zundel: there's a PR I don't know if you've had a chance to look at it, I don't know that it's anything you're going to care too much about but.

4
00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.460
Brent Zundel: If you get a chance to review it I think that'd be valuable.

5
00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:50.790
Hart Montgomery: This is the which one.

6
00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.250
Hart Montgomery: To 10 or two or three.

7
00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.130
Brent Zundel: Think it's to can.

8
00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.170
Hart Montgomery: To the credential values.

9
00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:02.430
Brent Zundel: Let me open it up here there's a SEC.

10
00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:06.510
Hart Montgomery: Is this the camera or the other guy.

11
00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.280
Brent Zundel: The other guy.

12
00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.270
Hart Montgomery: constitute okay.

13
00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:14.940
Brent Zundel: yeah the potential values json serialized be serialized it basically just adds.

14
00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.870
Brent Zundel: Some more it exposes more serialization options at the f5 layer

15
00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.610
Brent Zundel: In order to make changes work.

16
00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.680
Brent Zundel: That they want to expose in the earth ago rapper.

17
00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.580
Hart Montgomery: Okay, that seems fine.

18
00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.660
Brent Zundel: yeah I mean I think it's it's fine we've had.

19
00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.290
Brent Zundel: I don't know who Baron sleep direct is, but he also reviewed it.

20
00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:48.930
Brent Zundel: which was nice.

21
00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.760
Brent Zundel: And so I don't know if we need at least one more maintainer.

22
00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.680
Brent Zundel: to review it and approve it before.

23
00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.070
Hart Montgomery: So i'm tempted, I cannot technically be a maintainer.

24
00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:06.420
Brent Zundel: Oh right.

25
00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:08.370
Hart Montgomery: So I can like.

26
00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:14.370
Hart Montgomery: I can tell you what I think, but I can't count us an official review.

27
00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:29.580
Brent Zundel: yeah no problem I just i'm also fuzzy on how it works to have a new version of ursus show up is that does that kind of happen automatically as we build things, or is it a process that we need.

28
00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:31.650
Hart Montgomery: To cut a release right.

29
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.230
Brent Zundel: I sure.

30
00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.730
Hart Montgomery: So historically Mike has done releases.

31
00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.200
Brent Zundel: yeah historically Mike has been very distant another ball.

32
00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.760
Hart Montgomery: So yeah you just need to do like it's.

33
00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:54.570
Hart Montgomery: yeah you just it's like it's pretty it's not too bad for just doing it with rest right.

34
00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:00.810
Hart Montgomery: Like the rest processes not too too difficult well.

35
00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.470
Brent Zundel: Maybe I need to King Mike and have them give me a tutorial.

36
00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:10.680
Hart Montgomery: yeah it would be like 15 minutes I think i'm sure you could get it fast what's your email, by the way.

37
00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:15.120
Brent Zundel: i'm rent dot sundial at a vast.

38
00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:17.580
Hart Montgomery: See you empty l.

39
00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:19.080
Brent Zundel: Z UN.

Hart Montgomery: de la a vast AV St.

41
00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.600
Hart Montgomery: yeah COM yep.

42
00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.270
Hart Montgomery: Oh yeah are you have the security mailing list.

43
00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:34.650
Brent Zundel: I think I might be.

44
00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:40.830
Hart Montgomery: Okay there's just a male about or so there was somebody complaining about stuff and I think we addressed most of it.

45
00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:43.410
Brent Zundel: I didn't mean.

46
00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:45.210
Hart Montgomery: i'll just forward it to.

47
00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:48.630
Brent Zundel: yeah i'm not seeing that once maybe.

48
00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:03.270
Hart Montgomery: yeah I guess I missed that I was hoping to hear from Kevin folks were you on the call yesterday about the ducks.

49
00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:11.490
Brent Zundel: I have not been paying it I let me just say my status as an indie maintainer is.

50
00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:15.660
Brent Zundel: Probably rightfully questionable at this point.

51
00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:16.350
gotcha.

52
00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:19.620
Brent Zundel: So no I haven't.

53
00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:20.970
doors.

54
00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:23.820
Brent Zundel: The indie bugs.

55
00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:27.150
Hart Montgomery: What are you working on these days.

56
00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:30.930
Brent Zundel: let's see I went to my first ETF meeting.

57
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:52.650
Brent Zundel: So that was fun we was there when bbs was presented to the CFO rg and it sounded like everybody there thought it was neat and they're going to take it to the mailing list and decide whether they're going to formally review it as part of their their thing so that was cool.

58
00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:59.130
Brent Zundel: And then the other thing I was there for was the json web proofs.

59
00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:04.320
Brent Zundel: effort which I don't know how familiar, you are with that.

60
00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:05.550
Hart Montgomery: that's super.

61
00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:08.190
Brent Zundel: I you know what a job is.

62
00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:18.870
Brent Zundel: uh huh so the J wp is the Jose data structure that would enable.

63
00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:30.870
Brent Zundel: being signed by a signature that supports selective disclosure and holder binding, and you know signature randomization and predicates and all of that.

64
00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:32.010
yeah.

65
00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:35.220
Brent Zundel: which I mean pretty cool that.

66
00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:36.240
Hart Montgomery: yeah yeah.

67
00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:42.630
Brent Zundel: Ping identity and Microsoft are spearheading this effort to make those things more available and more usable.

68
00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:45.930
Hart Montgomery: yeah.

69
00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:52.740
Brent Zundel: So yeah that kind of stuff that in this the wcc are those two things are eating up most of my time nowadays.

70
00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:58.050
Hart Montgomery: yeah cool I mean I guess yeah this this a bunch of stuff going on.

71
00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:04.350
Hart Montgomery: Is drummond talked about the open wallet stuff.

72
00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:10.740
Brent Zundel: Yes, I was, I was present at the birth of the open wallet.

73
00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:15.270
Brent Zundel: Oh, you were you were there yeah I was at identifiers when they started talking about it and.

74
00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:20.580
Brent Zundel: I mean it sounds potentially like a really good idea.

75
00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:23.700
Hart Montgomery: But I think it's a great idea there's a huge amount of interest.

76
00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:30.120
Brent Zundel: yeah huge interest and me just like let's set up an open source.

77
00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:34.020
Brent Zundel: competitors competitor essentially to apple and Google.

78
00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:46.020
Brent Zundel: So if there's going to be a playing field at least they are at least they are either obviously going to not be playing along with everybody else, or they will have to play along with everybody else.

79
00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:47.970
Hart Montgomery: yep.

80
00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:52.530
Hart Montgomery: that'll that's an interesting thing I think the.

81
00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:57.810
Hart Montgomery: down the line i've done a little bit for that so.

82
00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:00.840
Hart Montgomery: we'll see where that ends up.

83
00:08:02.130 --> 00:08:03.660
Brent Zundel: yeah I think it's got a lot of potential.

84
00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:06.630
Hart Montgomery: To.

85
00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:12.330
Brent Zundel: shape shaping up the global forum prep shaping up.

86
00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:15.960
Hart Montgomery: that's come pretty well, I mean I think we're.

87
00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:20.250
Hart Montgomery: in good shape there, I mean the big specters eyes covered right.

88
00:08:21.030 --> 00:08:27.690
Brent Zundel: yeah I mean I traveled a lot is the last six months, and so.

89
00:08:29.490 --> 00:08:29.850
Hart Montgomery: yeah.

90
00:08:30.030 --> 00:08:41.310
Brent Zundel: Because being like the different precautions that are being taken, and this is every meeting was totally masked and there were tests available and other meetings i've gone to nobody wore masks and.

91
00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:45.990
Brent Zundel: I don't know that there was a huge difference in.

92
00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:51.000
Brent Zundel: Being at a conference.

93
00:08:52.770 --> 00:08:57.990
Hart Montgomery: yeah I don't know I did there's some there's still some companies that have pretty restricted travel policies.

94
00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:02.520
Hart Montgomery: Just because, like.

95
00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:08.940
Hart Montgomery: You know if you have an employee that say gets like long cove it right.

96
00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:11.100
Hart Montgomery: Out of work event.

97
00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:16.080
Hart Montgomery: Then that's you know that's not crazy for you right.

98
00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:17.670
Hart Montgomery: So.

99
00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:28.080
Hart Montgomery: yeah it's I mean it should be really nice, I mean it's also like you get the time slot right before OSS EU.

100
00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:32.430
Hart Montgomery: So there's a lot of.

101
00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:37.440
Hart Montgomery: We can send attendees there and we can have some attendees come as well.

102
00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:38.460
yeah.

103
00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:40.080
Hart Montgomery: So.

104
00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:42.660
Brent Zundel: We bombed it conflicts with key Pack.

105
00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:45.360
Hart Montgomery: yeah.

106
00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:48.810
Brent Zundel: i'll get to double in something.

107
00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:52.200
Hart Montgomery: yeah.

108
00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:54.960
Hart Montgomery: Definitely.

109
00:09:56.970 --> 00:09:58.440
Hart Montgomery: Is there anything else we should go over.

110
00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:00.450
Brent Zundel: and

111
00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:04.590
Brent Zundel: I don't know.

112
00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:07.920
Brent Zundel: I.

113
00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:13.350
Brent Zundel: i'm concerned about ursa.

114
00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:15.870
Hart Montgomery: i'm concerned actually about the hole.

115
00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:19.890
Hart Montgomery: In the areas ursa stack yeah.

116
00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:26.610
Hart Montgomery: it's probably even more concerned about India then ursa.

117
00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:27.690
Okay.

118
00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:31.140
Hart Montgomery: But yeah.

119
00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:39.510
Brent Zundel: yeah i'm i'm concerned about indie because the flagship indie product is being.

120
00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:42.150
Brent Zundel: In my brenda's team is managed.

121
00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:47.760
Brent Zundel: But I guess I don't know that they have much choice at this point.

122
00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:52.620
Hart Montgomery: yeah I don't know I mean.

123
00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:56.760
Hart Montgomery: So the worst case is you like you know.

124
00:10:59.010 --> 00:11:03.480
Hart Montgomery: it's easier to replace crypto primitives than a whole distributed ledger right.

125
00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:06.180
So, like.

126
00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:07.980
Hart Montgomery: You know.

127
00:11:13.050 --> 00:11:16.140
Hart Montgomery: yeah we've had some talks about this.

128
00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:21.390
Hart Montgomery: But yeah it's.

129
00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:26.400
Hart Montgomery: it's questionable whether the manpower is there.

130
00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:29.670
Hart Montgomery: Like.

131
00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:31.710
Hart Montgomery: So.

132
00:11:32.850 --> 00:11:46.260
Brent Zundel: So what What would you say is currently vibrant and exciting at hyper ledger because I haven't you know, been super involved I haven't been as involved there as I, as I formally was.

133
00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:51.330
Hart Montgomery: Baby most other things, or her are growing, I mean.

134
00:11:53.730 --> 00:11:55.500
Hart Montgomery: fabric is still plugging along.

135
00:11:57.870 --> 00:11:59.730
Hart Montgomery: You know I mean they're still.

136
00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:02.790
Hart Montgomery: You know.

137
00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:14.010
Hart Montgomery: Maybe slightly down from contributions from like 2018 but you know basically constant the past couple years base is growing a lot in popularity.

138
00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:21.270
Hart Montgomery: there's there's a lot of people who are interested in hybrid blockchain applications.

139
00:12:28.230 --> 00:12:40.680
Hart Montgomery: So, you know that they see scraped for that we've seen really explosive growth in some of the the tooling to interrupt stuff so like cactus and firefly I don't know if you're familiar with those.

140
00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:44.340
Brent Zundel: I am not, what can you give me a summary.

141
00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:53.910
Hart Montgomery: yeah so cactus is a blockchain interoperability project it's like focused on atomic swaps and cross chain transactions and things like that.

142
00:12:54.450 --> 00:12:55.890
Brent Zundel: How does that relate to quilt.

143
00:12:56.670 --> 00:12:57.150
A.

144
00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:07.770
Hart Montgomery: sort of does quote wasn't instantiate of a particular protocol, the quilt is dead so coulters deprecating cactus is much more general than quilt.

145
00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:20.850
Hart Montgomery: In cactus sort of takes a different approach, where it's like you're probably familiar with a lot of these blockchains that focus on interoperability try to be like a block chain of blockchains.

146
00:13:21.270 --> 00:13:21.690
yeah.

147
00:13:22.770 --> 00:13:26.130
Hart Montgomery: So cactus sort of more of an SDK and SDK.

148
00:13:30.450 --> 00:13:31.590
Hart Montgomery: If that makes sense.

149
00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:38.970
Brent Zundel: solo i'm still not seeing how I isn't that I would use that to do atomic swaps.

150
00:13:39.870 --> 00:13:48.900
Hart Montgomery: Well it's sort of you have you have a bunch of tooling around here like atomic swaps, and you can put it in sort of any kind of trust assumptions you want basically.

151
00:13:50.760 --> 00:14:03.570
Hart Montgomery: The point is that, like people may not want to trust another blockchain they might have some other trust assumption that they use for atomic so Apps right in fundamentally, you have to have some shared trust between a person if you're going to do an atomic swap right.

152
00:14:05.610 --> 00:14:05.850
well.

153
00:14:06.930 --> 00:14:07.260
Hart Montgomery: So.

154
00:14:09.810 --> 00:14:25.230
Hart Montgomery: So that's cactus and firefly is sort of you think of it as a middleware stack that lets you, you know sort of write code once and run it anywhere, so I don't know I mean it's there have been some efforts like this in the past, but this is, you know.

155
00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:30.210
Hart Montgomery: very, very strong I guess.

156
00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:35.310
Brent Zundel: So this is Java virtual machine a blockchain.

157
00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:36.930
Hart Montgomery: sort of yeah yeah.

158
00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:48.660
Brent Zundel: I know that they're probably this isn't the case, but I hear that i'm like oh good So if I have a vulnerability on one chain now it's everywhere.

159
00:14:49.830 --> 00:14:52.740
Hart Montgomery: Well, not necessarily right.

160
00:14:53.910 --> 00:14:57.720
Brent Zundel: I was thinking of the the smart contract bug this in this look at things and.

161
00:14:58.290 --> 00:14:58.770
share.

162
00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:07.860
Hart Montgomery: yeah if you think about it that way, if there's a bug at the top level it, it can propagate so.

163
00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:14.100
Hart Montgomery: yeah those are.

164
00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:17.220
Hart Montgomery: Those are really getting.

165
00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:25.080
Hart Montgomery: You know, getting interest and we see where we see plenty of interest in in D, but no one no developers.

166
00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:29.160
Brent Zundel: Right, I think people like oh Andy yeah this thing i've heard it's great.

167
00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:31.200
Hart Montgomery: And then, no one will.

168
00:15:31.470 --> 00:15:31.740
yeah.

169
00:15:35.310 --> 00:15:35.700
Hart Montgomery: So.

170
00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:40.290
Hart Montgomery: You yeah I don't know long term like.

171
00:15:42.990 --> 00:15:48.420
Hart Montgomery: My long term vision is there should sort of be an identity project that the Linux foundation.

172
00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:54.510
Hart Montgomery: But.

173
00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:57.750
Brent Zundel: The best of diff and toys and hyper ledger.

174
00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:07.410
Hart Montgomery: yeah I mean they sort of serve that there are those are all sort of different, but like there's a lot of tools that can be shared and used and.

175
00:16:13.290 --> 00:16:16.770
Hart Montgomery: yeah I don't know if that'll ever happen that's obviously just an opinion.

176
00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:31.080
Hart Montgomery: And the you know we have to have people who would be willing to handle that project obviously from a corporate side but yeah.

177
00:16:31.290 --> 00:16:33.900
Brent Zundel: Well, I think that's I mean that's why India suffering.

178
00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:42.180
Hart Montgomery: yeah I mean there aren't any like big corporate anchors right yeah I.

179
00:16:42.390 --> 00:16:45.360
Brent Zundel: Think fabric is still around and India is struggling.

180
00:16:46.350 --> 00:16:52.140
Hart Montgomery: Well, I mean i'd say there's there's just like you know some investment to to get it going great.

181
00:16:55.950 --> 00:16:56.460
Hart Montgomery: So.

182
00:16:59.220 --> 00:17:04.800
Hart Montgomery: yeah and I guess base you is sort of out of a startup but it's.

183
00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:19.020
Hart Montgomery: Well it's consensus, and they have like mega eighth bucks right yeah that's interesting I mean we've got a.

184
00:17:21.090 --> 00:17:25.410
Hart Montgomery: That that if you're in foundations, giving us a grant for basic it's kind of cool.

185
00:17:30.930 --> 00:17:31.860
Hart Montgomery: And we're like.

186
00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:44.610
Hart Montgomery: It was the first time they've done a grant for the open source for an open source project so it's a lot of work from me to get it, you know because they're used to just like giving stuff to companies right.

187
00:17:46.950 --> 00:17:49.650
Hart Montgomery: But if we get a grant you know we want it to go to the.

188
00:17:50.970 --> 00:17:52.590
Hart Montgomery: Like the actual developers right.

189
00:17:54.870 --> 00:17:55.140
Brent Zundel: Right.

190
00:17:58.080 --> 00:17:59.370
Hart Montgomery: So this was sort of a.

191
00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:04.260
Hart Montgomery: This is a bit of a complicated thing but.

192
00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:10.260
Hart Montgomery: yeah it's you know.

193
00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:18.690
Hart Montgomery: It was a it'll be a fairly substantial amount of youth to so that's pretty cool they.

194
00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:21.630
I.

195
00:18:22.830 --> 00:18:29.520
Brent Zundel: I have been so distant from the hyper ledger stuff lately that you know people ask what's going on there I just like.

196
00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:31.380
Brent Zundel: I don't know.

197
00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:46.680
Brent Zundel: anymore, I used to be neck deep in Aries and in the end ursa Now I know I keep my fingers in the ears of the pie, because I just don't want to let go, you know i'm trying to drum up resources, and you know because.

198
00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:53.610
Brent Zundel: Secure key and basketball security and has a really good track record of.

199
00:18:54.690 --> 00:18:55.110
Brent Zundel: You know.

200
00:18:56.340 --> 00:19:02.280
Brent Zundel: actually implementing things and providing developer resources to projects and just trying to.

201
00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:09.240
Brent Zundel: beat that drum get hearse on people's radar so that we can dedicate a couple months to but.

202
00:19:11.730 --> 00:19:12.180
Hart Montgomery: yeah.

203
00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:14.700
Brent Zundel: So far, no nothing and it's frustrating.

204
00:19:17.790 --> 00:19:19.710
Hart Montgomery: yeah well, let me know if I can help.

205
00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:32.520
Brent Zundel: I will, and I think we're gonna have, I think, Richard and drummond are going to be at the global forum and hopefully it's not just former ever numbers we're going to be there, hopefully, we also have.

206
00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:37.020
Brent Zundel: Some of that security people.

207
00:19:37.530 --> 00:19:42.480
Hart Montgomery: I think there are a lot of non evernote of identity people that are going to be there.

208
00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:46.890
Hart Montgomery: We have a lot of non every time identity talks so.

209
00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:51.990
Brent Zundel: yeah but i'm just so i'm saying from the vast world.

210
00:19:52.530 --> 00:19:53.490
Hart Montgomery: Oh gotcha yeah.

211
00:19:53.850 --> 00:19:57.960
Brent Zundel: You know i'm hoping someone from a basket comes other than Richard and drummond because.

212
00:19:59.850 --> 00:20:06.510
Brent Zundel: You know, we need more people here to kind of embrace the vision of hyper ledger or.

213
00:20:08.010 --> 00:20:16.140
Brent Zundel: we're not going to be around and I doubt that will totally leave because drummond is still an avast employee and gentlemen let's hyper ledger.

214
00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:20.100
Brent Zundel: But it's still just you know.

215
00:20:21.330 --> 00:20:36.840
Brent Zundel: we're not having the same commitment to it, the other things did and i've asked is still figuring out it's Open Source strategy and oh we're probably going to merge with Norton which is even worse open source that.

216
00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:39.060
Hart Montgomery: I particularly for this.

217
00:20:39.090 --> 00:20:43.590
Hart Montgomery: yeah for the kind of stuff have asked wants to do that yeah.

218
00:20:45.090 --> 00:20:46.740
Hart Montgomery: Open Source makes the most sense.

219
00:20:47.070 --> 00:20:56.460
Brent Zundel: That totally does so convincing them of that convincing ourselves of that is has been difficult.

220
00:20:57.360 --> 00:20:58.920
Hart Montgomery: yeah it's always a challenge to.

221
00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:03.900
Hart Montgomery: Get people who you know who aren't as comfortable with that.

222
00:21:06.270 --> 00:21:08.220
Hart Montgomery: But you know people come around.

223
00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:12.720
Brent Zundel: Well it's kind of an infectious vision.

224
00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:14.730
So.

225
00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:22.050
Hart Montgomery: You never see I always put out you never see someone go from open source to close source.

226
00:21:23.250 --> 00:21:24.120
Brent Zundel: Now, once you're.

227
00:21:25.950 --> 00:21:32.430
Hart Montgomery: Like oh i've worked for all these years and open source and close sources to answer you like never happened.

228
00:21:32.850 --> 00:21:34.050
Hart Montgomery: Literally doesn't happen.

229
00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:36.270
Hart Montgomery: it's only like a one way.

230
00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:37.290
Brent Zundel: yeah.

231
00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:46.950
Hart Montgomery: I always ask people this when they're you know when they're thinking about it i'm like Have you ever seen someone who's unhappy with the decision and decides to go back to close source.

232
00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:50.490
Hart Montgomery: That it's always crickets.

233
00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:52.620
Brent Zundel: yeah.

234
00:21:53.970 --> 00:21:54.360
Hart Montgomery: So.

235
00:21:57.900 --> 00:22:01.050
Brent Zundel: I think it's a similar thing with society.

236
00:22:02.250 --> 00:22:05.850
Brent Zundel: Once people kind of grasp onto the possibilities there.

237
00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:17.490
Brent Zundel: They they begin to look at federated identity with some reports they're like wait no, no, we don't want to do that want to do this other thing well it's not really a thing, yet, but we'll get.

238
00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:26.250
Hart Montgomery: yeah I mean the metaverse idealist what to use SSI to to which would be nice.

239
00:22:26.610 --> 00:22:26.880
yeah.

240
00:22:28.410 --> 00:22:29.970
Hart Montgomery: that's another application.

241
00:22:31.860 --> 00:22:54.390
Brent Zundel: Now I just say how personally gratifying it was to be sitting in a meeting at the IGF and hearing a presentation from Microsoft and Ping identity about the importance of zero knowledge proofs for selective disclosure and and it, it was it was crazy.

242
00:22:55.500 --> 00:23:04.950
Brent Zundel: To be like I just feel like I was one of the few people beating that drum for so long and so many people were like oh my God shut up with that drown we now.

243
00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:13.350
Brent Zundel: And now it's like I can just sit back and hear other people talk about these things it's just bizarre to me it's so cool.

244
00:23:14.370 --> 00:23:14.670
Hart Montgomery: yeah.

245
00:23:15.810 --> 00:23:18.600
Hart Montgomery: No it's it's it's the way forward.

246
00:23:21.870 --> 00:23:23.220
Hart Montgomery: So yeah.

247
00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:28.920
Hart Montgomery: We know what the end game is going to look like it's just sort of the question is how do we get there.

248
00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:38.640
Hart Montgomery: yeah and i'm hoping that, like something like this open wallet thing can really spur a bunch of.

249
00:23:40.260 --> 00:23:42.990
Hart Montgomery: a bunch of big company interest in this kind of thing.

250
00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:46.080
Brent Zundel: yeah.

251
00:23:47.250 --> 00:23:52.590
Hart Montgomery: Like if we can get like all these people interested in this to to like you know.

252
00:23:53.970 --> 00:23:57.060
Hart Montgomery: To contribute to like building, you know.

253
00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:01.590
Hart Montgomery: The cryptography backbone for SSI that'd be fantastic right.

254
00:24:02.370 --> 00:24:04.110
Hart Montgomery: yeah I don't.

255
00:24:05.370 --> 00:24:09.150
Hart Montgomery: necessarily care where it lives, I just wanted to exist.

256
00:24:10.020 --> 00:24:10.290
yeah.

257
00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:11.880
So.

258
00:24:15.870 --> 00:24:16.110
Hart Montgomery: yeah.

259
00:24:18.330 --> 00:24:25.770
Hart Montgomery: awesome well I should let you go yeah and yeah stay in touch, let me know if there's anything I can do to help you if you have any questions or anything like that cool.

260
00:24:25.860 --> 00:24:26.130
Brent Zundel: Thank you.

261
00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:31.020
Hart Montgomery: yeah Thank you have a great rest of your day bye bye bye.
