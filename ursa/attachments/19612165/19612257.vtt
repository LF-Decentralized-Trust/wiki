Victor Gridnevsky: <unknown>unknown<unknown>lang<unknown>unknown<unknown>

3
00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:27.689
Victor Gridnevsky: back to domestic to see what

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:31.550
Victor Gridnevsky: i'm still.

5
00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:55.800
But now

6
00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:03.160
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Ah, Alexis joined us.

7
00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:06.139
Hart Montgomery: Hello! How are you all? Today?

8
00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:08.630
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Ah,

9
00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:16.729
Hart Montgomery: we've had a blackout in, I mean here for an entire day. So a little out of the loop that's not good. Yeah

10
00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:20.390
Victor Gridnevsky: a bit late, but okay as otherwise.

11
00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:21.330
Victor Gridnevsky: How are you?

12
00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:24.289
Hart Montgomery: Ah, not too bad, busy as always. But you know

13
00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:27.149
I can't complain too much in the grand scheme of things

14
00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:29.270
Victor Gridnevsky: understandable.

15
00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:32.319
Aleksandr Petrosyan: It asked you to have

16
00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:34.100
Hart Montgomery: so

17
00:07:56.610 --> 00:07:57.670
Hart Montgomery: good.

18
00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:06.840
Hart Montgomery: So, Kam, said he's not going to be at the meeting today.

19
00:08:07.530 --> 00:08:10.300
Hart Montgomery: Ah, the discord

20
00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:15.370
which

21
00:08:37.039 --> 00:08:38.419
Hart Montgomery: probation

22
00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:42.669
Nathan George: Oh,

23
00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:46.199
Hart Montgomery: how are you today

24
00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:51.189
Nathan George: doing pretty good. It's a It's a busy meeting day today for me.

25
00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:52.250
Nathan George: How about you?

26
00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:53.369
Hart Montgomery: Yeah, me, too.

27
00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:57.359
Hart Montgomery: I actually have to drop at eight thirty. But I just wanted to stop in

28
00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:04.730
Hart Montgomery: um, I guess. Can't stop here, so I don't know if we have an agenda, So do you all want to?

29
00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:12.709
Hart Montgomery: Should we just get started? I don't know what. I guess we want to talk about the The Pr's

30
00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:17.460
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Sounds good by me.

31
00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:25.000
Hart Montgomery: Okay.

32
00:09:26.890 --> 00:09:28.450
Hart Montgomery: A bathroom.

33
00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:38.159
Nathan George: No objection here. I was thinking I was just going to come and lurk today, so i'm wondering where Cam and Mike and some of the other regulars are

34
00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:41.220
Hart Montgomery: woke up. Just, said he. Wasn't going to show up today. He

35
00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:45.789
Hart Montgomery: message that in the discord I like two hours ago.

36
00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:47.600
Hart Montgomery: Um,

37
00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:51.180
Hart Montgomery: but

38
00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:01.470
Hart Montgomery: yeah, I mean It's you all

39
00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:06.230
Hart Montgomery: I don't know. Do you want to talk about anything?

40
00:10:10.810 --> 00:10:13.600
Hart Montgomery: Right?

41
00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:16.240
Hart Montgomery: Yeah. Is your stuff moving forward, Alexander?

42
00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:20.790
Aleksandr Petrosyan: It's moving to the forensic place?

43
00:10:21.210 --> 00:10:26.359
Aleksandr Petrosyan: We are well off. Our team is way.

44
00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:31.420
Aleksandr Petrosyan: The other half is stretched thin over too many issues.

45
00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:39.829
Aleksandr Petrosyan: But there's some light at the end of the tunnel we are finishing with a large restructuring of our consensus,

46
00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:45.050
Aleksandr Petrosyan: and next week we should have a little bit more leeway to

47
00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:53.930
Aleksandr Petrosyan: some constructive improvements We're already eyeing a few specifically. We want to unpack the all dependencies, we

48
00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:59.030
Aleksandr Petrosyan: meaning that we're going to update all feature combinations.

49
00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:04.330
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Well, algorithms So um

50
00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:09.149
Aleksandr Petrosyan: include newer versions of what they depend on

51
00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:13.160
Aleksandr Petrosyan: the only one that is a little worrisome as cha cha Pauli.

52
00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:16.450
Aleksandr Petrosyan: But

53
00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:31.200
Aleksandr Petrosyan: we'll we'll get there when we get there, which shouldn't be too far problematic. I think there there was one deprecation, but that was it. I think the thing that they deprecated. This thing is something that Us: it doesn't use anyone.

54
00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:34.319
Hart Montgomery: So. Yeah, and a lot of this stuff is

55
00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:36.029
Hart Montgomery: Oh, sorry. Go ahead. I thought you were done.

56
00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:37.969
Aleksandr Petrosyan: No, no, no, i'm. I'm done

57
00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:42.549
Hart Montgomery: a lot of this stuff is used mine earlier only in testing.

58
00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:47.969
Hart Montgomery: So yeah it if you have any like uh,

59
00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:52.200
Hart Montgomery: if anything is bogged down just

60
00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:56.949
Hart Montgomery: uh tag me in a Pr. Or something, and i'll try to mail people

61
00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:00.190
Aleksandr Petrosyan: good.

62
00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:07.579
Hart Montgomery: We will have to create the

63
00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:13.920
Hart Montgomery: Good morning, Sean.

64
00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:17.640
Sean Bohan (Hyperledger): Everybody.

65
00:12:28.170 --> 00:12:30.130
Hart Montgomery: Nathan, Do you have anything?

66
00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:35.979
Nathan George: No, not particularly.

67
00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:49.989
Nathan George: I guess the other The piece that we ought to make sure that this community is up to speed on is the proposal for doing the non-creds formatting work in a new project. There's a project proposed off, and it's looking for feedback.

68
00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:57.389
Nathan George: And so, if you have any opinions on that, and how it affects both area vice versa. It's a good time to make that known folks who are proposing

69
00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:14.440
Hart Montgomery: draw more attention to to earth and the non-creds, and also help allow for modular credentials that can run on any ledger.

70
00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:17.150
Hart Montgomery: It's

71
00:13:17.810 --> 00:13:19.510
Hart Montgomery: needless to say I

72
00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:22.309
Hart Montgomery: I think it's a good idea.

73
00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:32.200
Sean Bohan (Hyperledger): Oh, go ahead, Alexander. Sorry. Go ahead

74
00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:36.930
Aleksandr Petrosyan: as nothing for my side.

75
00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:39.090
Sean Bohan (Hyperledger): Alright,

76
00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:40.270
Sean Bohan (Hyperledger): Go ahead. Sorry.

77
00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:45.190
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Keep interrupting each other. I think it's the lag.

78
00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:47.470
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Nothing for my set.

79
00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:52.710
Sean Bohan (Hyperledger): Cool. Um

80
00:13:53.000 --> 00:14:11.459
Sean Bohan (Hyperledger): for me. I had a conversation with a couple of folks last week about hey? I heard there are things going on there, so am I responsible? Yes, you should be attending your some meetings to find out what's changing, and so you understand what's going on. Um, i'm also going to speak to the next idea of the implementers call to make sure. Folks know that there's um

81
00:14:11.470 --> 00:14:23.700
Sean Bohan (Hyperledger): some weren't going into ersa, and if they want to understand where that work is going, they need to be attending this meeting. They need to be paying attention to the Orsa Discord Channel.

82
00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:41.740
Sean Bohan (Hyperledger): Someone did make a request like, Is there a roadmap? And I said, No. But if you'd like to join these calls and help develop one that would be awesome. So i'm i'm trying to get some more folks in here um who have skin in the game in regards to Ursa, but have not been either contributing or not to paying attention to what's going on. So i'm working on that

83
00:14:45.570 --> 00:14:50.900
Hart Montgomery: awesome. Yeah, I hope this a non-credit stuff, Nathan, did you want to say something

84
00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:57.780
Nathan George: just in regards to the roadmap? We've had for a long time the initiative called operation. Oh, so

85
00:14:57.790 --> 00:15:21.110
Nathan George: um! Which is a set of bugs and tickets that need to be resolved to update the packaging and code composition of ersa that we could really use some help with. But we have had a hard time getting folks to volunteer for. Some of those.

86
00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:24.600
Sean Bohan (Hyperledger): Do what I can do

87
00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:29.260
Aleksandr Petrosyan: me as well. Um, we

88
00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:32.220
Aleksandr Petrosyan: are kind of the people who should be doing that.

89
00:15:36.970 --> 00:15:38.860
Aleksandr Petrosyan: In other words, we volunteer.

90
00:15:43.050 --> 00:15:44.130
Hart Montgomery: So

91
00:15:52.530 --> 00:16:03.099
Hart Montgomery: yeah, we we are Also, I've been trying to drive more interest in all the Non- credential stuff that I want. I'm been attempting to get like

92
00:16:03.220 --> 00:16:05.609
Hart Montgomery: like we've been

93
00:16:06.010 --> 00:16:11.880
Hart Montgomery: fumbling around with a meeting with Anna License Gaia and some other people to try to get

94
00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:15.660
Hart Montgomery: more serious

95
00:16:15.750 --> 00:16:17.180
Hart Montgomery: to graphic attention.

96
00:16:17.310 --> 00:16:18.320
Hart Montgomery: So,

97
00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:29.690
Hart Montgomery: anyway, does anyone have anything else? They want to talk about, you know. If not, I know It's late for you guys. We should probably let you go.

98
00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:36.430
Aleksandr Petrosyan: We're fine.

99
00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:39.400
Hart Montgomery: I'm sorry, because

100
00:16:40.210 --> 00:16:41.509
Aleksandr Petrosyan: oh, thank you

101
00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:44.609
Hart Montgomery: all right. Should we close the meeting? Then?

102
00:16:51.550 --> 00:16:57.810
Hart Montgomery: Awesome. Well, thanks a lot for your time, and let's continue any further conversations by email.

103
00:16:57.910 --> 00:16:59.109
Hart Montgomery: Thanks a lot.

104
00:16:59.690 --> 00:17:01.890
Hart Montgomery: We'll talk to you out later,

105
00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:02.910
Hart Montgomery: bye bye,

106
00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:04.150
Victor Gridnevsky: likewise.

107
00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:06.249
Sean Bohan (Hyperledger): Thanks, everybody.
