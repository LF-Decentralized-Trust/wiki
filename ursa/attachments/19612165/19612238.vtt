1
00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.640
Cam Parra: hey welcome everybody um.

2
00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.800
Cam Parra: yeah we can wait a couple minutes and see if anyone else struggles and then we can start.

3
00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.670
Cam Parra: Alright cool well welcome everyone.

4
00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.350
Cam Parra: This is the bi weekly or circle.

5
00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:11.160
Cam Parra: And i'm camper yeah you guys know me but yeah so we don't have much on the agenda today we.

6
00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:22.110
Cam Parra: For updates we're still again waiting for the ursa fix that's still not out yeah where we're waiting for.

7
00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:29.790
Cam Parra: The code owners to supply that and so what we're still waiting on that.

8
00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:31.890
Cam Parra: Besides that.

9
00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:43.830
Cam Parra: We don't have any further announcements then just waiting on that the work on our yeah, I guess, like the other small announcement will be that there's the work on.

10
00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:58.230
Cam Parra: Operation also is slowing down, due to my limited time, but when I do have more time, I will continue that work um and yeah I don't have anything else.

11
00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:06.030
Cam Parra: On the agenda, but I can open up the floor to you guys, to see if you guys have any concerns or topics that you want to talk about today.

12
00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:20.700
Brent Zundel: There is a PR in the earth's ago rapper.

13
00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:23.790
Brent Zundel: That we might look at.

14
00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:30.450
Cam Parra: Could you link that in the chat sure.

15
00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:16.890
Brent Zundel: Ideally somebody with more go experienced than me would look at it.

16
00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:18.540
But.

17
00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:25.140
Brent Zundel: In a very quiet.

18
00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:33.480
Cam Parra: heart, do you know any Are you familiar with go or.

19
00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:38.160
Hart Montgomery: No i'm not a big go person, unfortunately, and this is just the rapper right.

20
00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:41.910
Hart Montgomery: Do we know actually who's using this.

21
00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:43.860
Brent Zundel: On.

22
00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:46.500
Hart Montgomery: Besides, apparently, like Center.

23
00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:48.330
Brent Zundel: um I.

24
00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:53.190
Brent Zundel: I think so Alex used to be contracted with evernote.

25
00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:55.950
Hart Montgomery: Right now, he works for dsr right.

26
00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:57.150
Brent Zundel: works for dsr.

27
00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:07.860
Brent Zundel: yeah I think that he's actually contracting with your key, which means he's contracting for a vast slash effort and again.

28
00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:14.340
Brent Zundel: Sure, I think this might be someone like literally me but just somebody else that I don't know about.

29
00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:20.280
Brent Zundel: But like we have an Aries framework go.

30
00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:21.660
Hart Montgomery: thing and I broke.

31
00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:29.490
Brent Zundel: The earth's ago rapper to do bbs plus by we I mean security but that's me now so.

32
00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:32.220
Brent Zundel: yeah.

33
00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:35.820
that's yeah.

34
00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:42.960
Cam Parra: Alex isn't on Daniels team anymore Daniels team is secure key.

35
00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:46.710
Brent Zundel: know I guess that's where i'm confused because.

36
00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:52.110
Hart Montgomery: yeah this this doesn't look like a lot of coach agents right.

37
00:06:52.590 --> 00:07:02.430
Brent Zundel: Well he's literally just modifying the way that errors are handled, but in order to get the PR to pass he had to make changes to the build the ammo file.

38
00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:06.450
Hart Montgomery: yeah i'm looking at that.

39
00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:15.690
Brent Zundel: And like that's the part of it that makes me a little nervous and honestly if it was anybody, other than Alex proposing it i'd be like no.

40
00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:22.410
Brent Zundel: But i'm confident that Alex will then build process.

41
00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:30.240
Hart Montgomery: yeah I mean I, this is not something where i'm an expert.

42
00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:35.820
Hart Montgomery: So.

43
00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:48.930
Cam Parra: With the build process he's not doing anything I think major think he's just renaming things and I think that's fine the go part i'm not familiar with go so.

44
00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:56.250
Cam Parra: So I don't have the expertise to do but yeah besides that everything seems pretty normal.

45
00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:04.050
Brent Zundel: Well, in the build thing is commenting a bunch of stuff out so much stuff just isn't happening anymore that used to happen so that's where i'm like oh.

46
00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:09.720
Nathan George: yeah and he's calling up and it's the fix to do, the question is who's who's going to do the fix.

47
00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:16.410
Brent Zundel: Right and i'm, I would like a little bit more commitment from him saying yes, I will come back and fix the to do.

48
00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:18.570
Brent Zundel: Before we merge it.

49
00:08:21.030 --> 00:08:22.980
Cam Parra: Or the, the only code owners.

50
00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:26.670
Cam Parra: For our early on, only users for this rapper then.

51
00:08:27.810 --> 00:08:28.110
Cam Parra: Is.

52
00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:33.600
Cam Parra: The other go team they don't they don't use her sorry.

53
00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:43.920
Nathan George: my previous standing is that they were using a go native implementation and not ursa so i'm excited that someone's here, using the go rapper.

54
00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:58.380
Cam Parra: I think I think Alex is open to discussion if we if we asked him more.

55
00:08:58.410 --> 00:09:00.780
Cam Parra: More questions yeah he's.

56
00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:08.040
Hart Montgomery: Good about this right so just i'd say just got to spell out your questions and concerns in the PR.

57
00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:23.880
Cam Parra: So yeah I will i'll comment those questions after after this meeting some of the questions that were concerned are raised here.

58
00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:33.120
Brent Zundel: And if anybody has contact with any of the listed versa, go maintain owners.

59
00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:40.770
Hart Montgomery: So who's left on that right, well, I think it was it was Michaela that did most of it right, but she left.

60
00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:50.280
Brent Zundel: I mean all I know, is the three people that are currently members of the earth's a rapper co maintainer.

61
00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:55.920
Hart Montgomery: So who sorry, who is that it to look.

62
00:09:56.160 --> 00:10:00.090
Brent Zundel: github handles I have musi my butter seven and here Hello.

63
00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:02.010
Hart Montgomery: Okay, so if.

64
00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:15.000
Cam Parra: We all have contact with Mike.

65
00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:18.660
Hart Montgomery: Philip is there right.

66
00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:23.310
Hart Montgomery: Sorry, who is the first one.

67
00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:26.250
Brent Zundel: But the github handle is Lucy.

68
00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:31.560
Hart Montgomery: Is that Michaela.

69
00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:35.760
Cam Parra: No it's Kevin Griffin.

70
00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:36.570
Oh.

71
00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:38.730
Okay.

72
00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:49.650
Hart Montgomery: I don't know it's probably worth the mail to these people right.

73
00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:58.050
Brent Zundel: So it was it came up on my radar again because right set out.

74
00:10:59.130 --> 00:11:09.060
Brent Zundel: an email saying hey person maintainer or I think it was a bit of a dysport thing but anyway, I gotta pay ursa maintainer come check this out.

75
00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:15.030
Brent Zundel: So I I was operating under the expectation that.

76
00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:19.350
Brent Zundel: He had already contacted the.

77
00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:22.740
The maintainer is there.

78
00:11:26.490 --> 00:11:26.910
Hart Montgomery: I don't know.

79
00:11:30.570 --> 00:11:33.270
Hart Montgomery: I can ask him, but I would be yeah.

80
00:11:38.010 --> 00:11:41.610
Hart Montgomery: yeah maybe just to explain your comments to Alex.

81
00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:46.350
Hart Montgomery: Thanks make sure he's gonna tidy the rest of the stuff up.

82
00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:49.680
Hart Montgomery: But not, why not.

83
00:11:50.190 --> 00:11:51.630
Brent Zundel: I added a comment to the.

84
00:11:54.270 --> 00:11:56.550
apartment good PR.

85
00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:01.560
Cam Parra: Okay cool.

86
00:12:05.130 --> 00:12:06.780
Hart Montgomery: he's usually pretty responsive right.

87
00:12:09.450 --> 00:12:17.640
Brent Zundel: yeah I mean the impression that i've gotten is that Alex is actively pushing to be like hey Can somebody please merge this yeah so.

88
00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:23.370
Cam Parra: yeah i'm sure they're frustrated with this, because they their team goes pretty fast.

89
00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:37.830
Cam Parra: So, if anything, if we don't get response from the other containers I say we just merge it and we if it really causes that much damage to the other maintainer, then we can revert it.

90
00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:40.080
Hart Montgomery: But I have it if.

91
00:12:41.130 --> 00:12:44.370
Hart Montgomery: What if they're not responding right, then, at some point it's on them.

92
00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:45.810
yeah.

93
00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:54.360
Cam Parra: yeah I think I think at this point, if this is, these are the users, we can just add because we have merging abilities here so.

94
00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:02.400
Brent Zundel: yeah if I want to see what Alex says so, my comment and then based on his response.

95
00:13:03.510 --> 00:13:05.070
Brent Zundel: And that willing to merge.

96
00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:22.110
Cam Parra: yeah if if Alex wants if Alex wants to be a maintainer there too, I would not disagree with that that would be a good thing.

97
00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:36.900
Cam Parra: he's got a PhD in math so he's barely understand what's going on.

98
00:13:45.930 --> 00:13:50.820
Hart Montgomery: They never know what the math PhDs think so, I have some funny experiences about that.

99
00:13:55.890 --> 00:13:57.360
Cam Parra: I guess it is different, like.

100
00:13:57.510 --> 00:14:03.060
Cam Parra: The computer science math professors had a very different mindset than my math professors.

101
00:14:04.170 --> 00:14:10.230
Hart Montgomery: I just laughed because I had a bunch of math a bunch of Stanford math PhD students who should have known better.

102
00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:20.580
Hart Montgomery: Try to pitch me on this idea and involve them breaking information theory lower bounds.

103
00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:27.420
Hart Montgomery: Which which they had not thought about.

104
00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:32.550
Hart Montgomery: To have you see their whole idea is completely berkus.

105
00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:39.330
Brent Zundel: Hard I think if you just had more open mind.

106
00:14:39.510 --> 00:14:40.320
Hart Montgomery: yeah I know.

107
00:14:41.310 --> 00:14:43.800
Brent Zundel: Just for breaking those lower bounds and.

108
00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:58.380
Hart Montgomery: i'll tell you what it was in like 30 seconds, so they they wanted me to read this like tried it they they knew they needed a computer scientist, but say want me to read this like algebra geometry stuff so I did okay great.

109
00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:00.420
Hart Montgomery: And then.

110
00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:07.410
Hart Montgomery: This algebraic geometry stuff was all about you know, representing.

111
00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:12.960
Hart Montgomery: More abstracted numbers but, basically, you know.

112
00:15:16.770 --> 00:15:25.470
Hart Montgomery: You know one number of you know, between zero and and as two numbers between zero and square root ad.

113
00:15:27.450 --> 00:15:33.510
Hart Montgomery: And they thought this was going to to revolutionize you know how things are stored.

114
00:15:34.710 --> 00:15:44.340
Hart Montgomery: Then I asked them how long how large does it, how many bits does it take to store number of size zero to end and how many bits does it take to that store number of size zero to route ad.

115
00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:48.030
Hart Montgomery: And then they they got very sheepish.

116
00:15:51.840 --> 00:16:02.610
Hart Montgomery: You know and we're not happy, but I did get a check for reading that algebra geometry is a Grad student so that was nice.

117
00:16:08.370 --> 00:16:10.560
Hart Montgomery: anyways sorry for the anecdote.

118
00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:13.020
Brent Zundel: No that's good again.

119
00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:17.400
Hart Montgomery: yeah so so let's just.

120
00:16:18.630 --> 00:16:22.410
Hart Montgomery: see it Alexander has to say, you know should all be fine.

121
00:16:24.270 --> 00:16:26.760
Cam Parra: yeah and I haven't heard too much from the.

122
00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:38.820
Cam Parra: So just under the radar the like I haven't heard too much from the Aries folks about the earth of them wanting to ursa fix so I don't know if they're that.

123
00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:40.260
Cam Parra: Right now.

124
00:16:40.650 --> 00:16:44.160
Hart Montgomery: They have other more pressing security issues.

125
00:16:44.970 --> 00:16:46.380
Cam Parra: Are those not out the door yet.

126
00:16:46.470 --> 00:16:48.510
Hart Montgomery: or like I don't think so okay.

127
00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:55.410
Hart Montgomery: So, like this is pretty minor compared to some of the other issues.

128
00:17:01.470 --> 00:17:02.700
Hart Montgomery: So yeah.

129
00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:06.240
Cam Parra: Well that's good.

130
00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:09.000
Brent Zundel: connection stuff the.

131
00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:12.570
Brent Zundel: Is that the indie issues you're referring to is.

132
00:17:12.570 --> 00:17:14.610
Hart Montgomery: Like the remote execution.

133
00:17:16.110 --> 00:17:17.700
Hart Montgomery: is quite problematic.

134
00:17:19.470 --> 00:17:22.110
Cam Parra: And I think they have a denial of service issue as well.

135
00:17:22.170 --> 00:17:24.240
Hart Montgomery: there's a big denial of service issue too yeah.

136
00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:31.770
Brent Zundel: Now service issue, I think I just had to update my note to address that one, but then.

137
00:17:32.970 --> 00:17:33.540
Brent Zundel: The.

138
00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:41.700
Brent Zundel: isn't the remote execution one though require physical connection to like.

139
00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:44.280
Hart Montgomery: I think any issue on the network can do it.

140
00:17:46.410 --> 00:17:48.330
Brent Zundel: Any issue or so, not just any.

141
00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:49.410
validate yeah.

142
00:17:56.280 --> 00:18:00.240
Hart Montgomery: Something like that, and maybe i'm maybe it's it's running incorrectly but.

143
00:18:02.010 --> 00:18:08.640
Brent Zundel: it's like it's theoretically possible for a validator to inject their own code into the.

144
00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:11.370
Brent Zundel: You know, whatever process.

145
00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:13.230
Hart Montgomery: something along those lines.

146
00:18:13.890 --> 00:18:15.480
Brent Zundel: yeah we told them about that.

147
00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:27.990
Brent Zundel: 2018 mean I that's when I when when we had it reviewed and somebody said yeah it's problem, is it not even it's not a problem again.

148
00:18:28.650 --> 00:18:30.210
Hart Montgomery: Well there's a lot of technical debt.

149
00:18:33.630 --> 00:18:35.040
Hart Montgomery: it's true so.

150
00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:42.960
Hart Montgomery: anyway.

151
00:18:43.350 --> 00:18:43.890
Cam Parra: Once they.

152
00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:51.780
Cam Parra: Once they fix that they'll it'll be on our on their radar but um I guess the um The other thing is that.

153
00:18:53.580 --> 00:19:10.500
Cam Parra: there's going to be someone at hyper ledger forum talking about this issue, but hasn't been released, yet, so I guess, we might if we don't have the code, by then, I guess, releasing the at least the what the bug is on on our code base might be good.

154
00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:14.070
Hart Montgomery: yep it's good totally CVs I mean it's.

155
00:19:15.090 --> 00:19:16.080
Hart Montgomery: This is something that.

156
00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:19.710
Hart Montgomery: That can be retroactively checked right.

157
00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:21.240
Cam Parra: uh huh.

158
00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:26.850
Hart Montgomery: So, like, if I have my credentials Now you can ask me to release the proof later.

159
00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:28.950
Hart Montgomery: Presumably.

160
00:19:32.370 --> 00:19:32.760
Hart Montgomery: So.

161
00:19:33.150 --> 00:19:33.750
yeah.

162
00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:37.320
Hart Montgomery: God I don't know how long the fix is going to take.

163
00:19:38.850 --> 00:19:40.440
Cam Parra: yeah I don't know how limited.

164
00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:42.600
Cam Parra: Time is right now.

165
00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:47.550
Brent Zundel: far as I know time we're interested in helping herself.

166
00:19:47.610 --> 00:19:48.360
Hart Montgomery: But.

167
00:19:49.110 --> 00:19:53.280
Brent Zundel: As far as I can tell my cousin neither time nor interested in helping or something.

168
00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:55.680
Hart Montgomery: Like yes, mostly lack of time.

169
00:19:57.630 --> 00:20:09.030
Cam Parra: yeah he committed he committed to making this in front of a bunch of stakeholders so that's I mean I think that's enough interest, but you know.

170
00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:13.050
Hart Montgomery: We should probably have some kind of plan if Mike can't do it right.

171
00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:15.030
Cam Parra: Right.

172
00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:20.190
Cam Parra: So.

173
00:20:20.250 --> 00:20:21.720
Cam Parra: That might be willing, is, I think.

174
00:20:21.870 --> 00:20:27.270
Cam Parra: Most of us on the call here have little to no resources to to make that fix.

175
00:20:29.130 --> 00:20:29.790
Hart Montgomery: Yes.

176
00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:35.280
Cam Parra: So we gotta we gotta we gotta get Stephen Korean and some of the.

177
00:20:36.930 --> 00:20:39.660
Cam Parra: Santa coming in and take a look.

178
00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:44.760
Hart Montgomery: So yeah I agree.

179
00:20:49.230 --> 00:20:55.500
Cam Parra: cool well I don't have anything else does anyone have anything else, they would like to discuss Nathan, do you have anything.

180
00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:04.170
Nathan George: No unless there's any other updates around operation also or you know.

181
00:21:05.220 --> 00:21:10.710
Nathan George: Help wanted type things that we could mark to get a better on ramp to others that want to get involved.

182
00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:21.690
Hart Montgomery: yeah as far as the on ramps go, I think.

183
00:21:23.730 --> 00:21:28.890
Hart Montgomery: cam nailed it, we need to get the people that are actually using it more involved right.

184
00:21:30.990 --> 00:21:33.840
Brent Zundel: Now i'm working on that within my organization.

185
00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:39.930
Brent Zundel: I think the conversation like be used this if we plan to continue using it, we need to help maintain it.

186
00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:43.770
Brent Zundel: Or we need to decide we're not going to use it anymore.

187
00:21:44.610 --> 00:21:45.840
Brent Zundel: yep so.

188
00:21:47.730 --> 00:21:53.790
Brent Zundel: I am forcing those conversations, but haven't gotten a final decision at all.

189
00:21:58.320 --> 00:21:58.710
Hart Montgomery: So.

190
00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:09.690
Cam Parra: yeah I think I think once once those major vulnerabilities are fixed in India think that's when we need to strike up the conversation of like.

191
00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:19.590
Cam Parra: Okay yeah your your frameworks breaking but also now if you don't maintain this is going to cause you more headaches down the road and it might not be in like such a.

192
00:22:20.220 --> 00:22:27.840
Cam Parra: Threatening tone, but just like you know, helping them see that this is like the core of their platform and that they need to maintain it.

193
00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:35.580
Hart Montgomery: Another like I guess more speculative thing is Brent you may have seen this because your company is.

194
00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:40.590
Hart Montgomery: Is tentatively involved have you seen this new open wallet effort.

195
00:22:41.850 --> 00:22:45.810
Brent Zundel: I know some things about the new open wallet effort, yes.

196
00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:46.260
yeah.

197
00:22:48.810 --> 00:22:51.150
Hart Montgomery: So that that might be.

198
00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:53.940
Hart Montgomery: Like.

199
00:22:56.760 --> 00:22:59.040
Hart Montgomery: That might be a way to.

200
00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:06.000
Hart Montgomery: You know figure out how to get sort of more resources for this kind of thing right.

201
00:23:16.350 --> 00:23:17.370
Hart Montgomery: You are there.

202
00:23:18.510 --> 00:23:19.920
Brent Zundel: yeah thinking.

203
00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:23.100
Hart Montgomery: I don't like the.

204
00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:27.150
Hart Montgomery: The list of people who.

205
00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:33.450
Hart Montgomery: who showed up to that is is quite interesting and quite large.

206
00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:36.990
Hart Montgomery: If that project.

207
00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:41.220
Hart Montgomery: decides to use anonymous credentials right then.

208
00:23:44.790 --> 00:23:45.150
Hart Montgomery: You know.

209
00:23:46.740 --> 00:23:51.180
Hart Montgomery: That might be a possible way forward is to to work with those people.

210
00:23:58.050 --> 00:23:58.320
Brent Zundel: yeah.

211
00:24:02.070 --> 00:24:02.400
Hart Montgomery: yeah.

212
00:24:04.650 --> 00:24:05.040
So.

213
00:24:06.510 --> 00:24:06.930
Hart Montgomery: anyway.

214
00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:17.340
Cam Parra: yeah do you have any ideas Nathan, of what we should do, or.

215
00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:31.650
Nathan George: um well my original comment was more around being ready for when we can do something, or when we have an opportunity like that the idea that there's a list of folks we could reach out to.

216
00:24:32.340 --> 00:24:37.800
Nathan George: Or we could do something to make ourselves attractive to a particular use case is a lot more compelling than just.

217
00:24:39.660 --> 00:24:54.690
Nathan George: Having some to do tickets marked and ready to go, I think the trouble we've had in the past is that we either it was really hard to understand how anyone could help without you know, having significant cryptography experience or.

218
00:24:58.140 --> 00:25:08.520
Nathan George: We didn't have a lot of ways they could get involved when this kind of opportunity arose, so you know i'm not sure how timely, we can be.

219
00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:17.520
Nathan George: In terms of can we put together and make an example or anything that would help those kinds of groups pick up our code and use it more easily.

220
00:25:18.060 --> 00:25:24.000
Nathan George: It feels like there's probably a couple of simple things we could do that would be low effort on our part, compared to the amount of help to get.

221
00:25:31.890 --> 00:25:32.880
Hart Montgomery: This yeah there's.

222
00:25:35.670 --> 00:25:37.500
Hart Montgomery: That that makes perfect sense.

223
00:25:42.150 --> 00:25:42.510
So.

224
00:25:50.130 --> 00:25:54.780
Nathan George: Are you understand enough about what they're trying to do that, you could write you know, maybe like a.

225
00:25:55.800 --> 00:26:00.420
Nathan George: Just a some lines a pseudo code for their use case, so that we could put together a code example.

226
00:26:00.450 --> 00:26:02.310
Hart Montgomery: For whom for the open wallet.

227
00:26:02.850 --> 00:26:03.150
yeah.

228
00:26:04.710 --> 00:26:15.540
Hart Montgomery: I mean we are, I think we're you know we're beyond that we have a lot of people in the open wallet discussion who use, you know areas in ursa.

229
00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:20.730
Hart Montgomery: So.

230
00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:28.710
Hart Montgomery: I think that that use cases going to be pretty well documented, I mean people are going to understand that already.

231
00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:48.690
Hart Montgomery: The question is, is you know, like can we convince the that group that they need to have an anonymous credential solution, you know I think they should, I think a lot of people think they should certainly I think brent's people who are in the call would think they should.

232
00:26:52.050 --> 00:26:52.530
Hart Montgomery: So.

233
00:26:54.030 --> 00:26:57.660
Hart Montgomery: You know, and if you want me to link you into that Nathan or cam I can.

234
00:27:02.730 --> 00:27:06.090
Hart Montgomery: I don't know if you have the bandwidth but i'd be happy to do so, if you like.

235
00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:16.770
Nathan George: i'm pretty sure I don't have the bandwidth but i've been asked to the link being anyway.

236
00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:18.930
Hart Montgomery: Okay.

237
00:27:19.410 --> 00:27:21.900
Cam Parra: yeah same I might not be able to make it I.

238
00:27:22.650 --> 00:27:23.520
Hart Montgomery: mean it's more like.

239
00:27:24.150 --> 00:27:25.620
Hart Montgomery: yeah it's more like it's.

240
00:27:27.210 --> 00:27:31.020
Hart Montgomery: I think the business people are involved right now but yeah they they need more.

241
00:27:32.250 --> 00:27:33.780
Hart Montgomery: More guidance I think so.

242
00:27:38.340 --> 00:27:41.820
Cam Parra: That open wallet effort is happening in hyper ledger.

243
00:27:43.140 --> 00:27:46.350
Hart Montgomery: it's outside hyper ledger but in the lf.

244
00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:55.410
Hart Montgomery: Okay, so it's still in a left leg, but it looks like there and it's it's it's not a blockchain project necessarily right.

245
00:27:57.510 --> 00:27:58.170
Cam Parra: Right.

246
00:27:58.470 --> 00:28:00.270
Hart Montgomery: They want it to be broader than blockchain.

247
00:28:02.730 --> 00:28:03.150
Hart Montgomery: So.

248
00:28:04.830 --> 00:28:11.550
Hart Montgomery: But as the like person with cryptography knowledge and lf I get.

249
00:28:12.930 --> 00:28:14.880
Hart Montgomery: dragged onto this stuff occasionally so.

250
00:28:22.290 --> 00:28:22.710
Hart Montgomery: anyway.

251
00:28:25.950 --> 00:28:28.200
Hart Montgomery: actually have to drop for any 30 think.

252
00:28:29.970 --> 00:28:34.290
Cam Parra: that's Okay, I think we can end now, but thank you all for attending.

253
00:28:35.790 --> 00:28:48.210
Cam Parra: there's any topics you'd like to discuss next time that be in go ahead and link them in the discord chat i'll keep track of that and yeah we'll see everyone in two weeks.

254
00:28:48.780 --> 00:28:49.500
Hart Montgomery: looks like him.

255
00:28:51.630 --> 00:28:52.200
Cam Parra: Thanks everyone.
