Cam Parra: Are you.

3
00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:15.990
Hart Montgomery: Not too bad.

4
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:23.250
Hart Montgomery: So.

5
00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:25.410
Hart Montgomery: How are things.

6
00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.500
Cam Parra: i'm everything is going well.

7
00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:29.580
Good.

8
00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:35.190
Cam Parra: always forget that.

9
00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.910
Cam Parra: I have probably copyright.

10
00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.530
Cam Parra: backgrounds, as my as my zoom backgrounds.

11
00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:49.380
Cam Parra: Are you a.

12
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.860
Cam Parra: crypto this week or.

13
00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:53.910
Hart Montgomery: I am yeah.

14
00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:55.710
Cam Parra: cool how's that going.

15
00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:02.220
Hart Montgomery: it's good I actually pitched self sovereign identity in a row session talking got a lot of attention so.

16
00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.250
Cam Parra: cool, who was there.

17
00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:07.260
Hart Montgomery: lots of people.

18
00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:09.990
Hart Montgomery: I mean.

19
00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.920
Hart Montgomery: Do you want to ask about anyone in particular.

20
00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:20.040
Cam Parra: I don't know I don't I don't know anyone to ask about in particular Brent are you there as well.

21
00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.280
Brent Zundel: I am not this year.

22
00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.930
Brent Zundel: was not one of the critical places for me to go and my wife forbade me from traveling during August.

23
00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:37.470
Cam Parra: Probably not the best week either, since your kids are probably going back to school.

24
00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.840
Brent Zundel: That was also a consideration.

25
00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.530
Hart Montgomery: Is it back to school week.

26
00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:46.170
Cam Parra: yeah it's Back to School week here in utah.

27
00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:47.220
gotcha.

28
00:01:51.240 --> 00:02:00.120
Cam Parra: cool um well, we can get started, I don't know if Nathan is joining us today, we might be on I think he was on pto these last couple of days so.

29
00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:14.130
Cam Parra: Maybe today I don't know if he's out today or not um but um yeah I guess i'm Brent do you have any do you have any PR that you want to bring up, I know that you've been working on some.

30
00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.880
Brent Zundel: I want to look at your PR two or three it's been approved it just has some merge conflicts.

31
00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.530
Cam Parra: Okay.

32
00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:27.570
Brent Zundel: And so, if those get addressed, and we can we can merge it.

33
00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:30.420
Cam Parra: Let me take a look.

34
00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:43.680
Brent Zundel: I also like to talk about what needs to happen in order for us to get another arrest or release out.

35
00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:52.380
Cam Parra: yeah for sure.

36
00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.400
Cam Parra: um so yeah so the merge conflicts.

37
00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:07.080
Cam Parra: Okay yeah I can I can I can take that on as a task today and get this merged today.

38
00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:09.300
Brent Zundel: Okay.

39
00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:11.640
Cam Parra: That sounds good.

40
00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:13.320
Cam Parra: To me.

41
00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:23.880
Cam Parra: um so a release I don't know what would we would release, I guess, we could release this ursa core.

42
00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.730
Cam Parra: um did you have anything specific in mind Brent.

43
00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:31.680
Brent Zundel: Well, some of the.

44
00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:40.140
Brent Zundel: Other PR that went in and added little fixes to like the FN five stuff.

45
00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:50.280
Brent Zundel: that's being used by the go rapper and it's, particularly the go rapper that's that's looking for a new release of ursa so that they can.

46
00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:54.180
Brent Zundel: So they can have a new release of the go rapper.

47
00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.050
Hart Montgomery: yeah it's the dsr guys that want to do the new release trade.

48
00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:04.590
Brent Zundel: yeah dsr guys who were not really working for bass.

49
00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:08.640
Hart Montgomery: yeah I mean I guess.

50
00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:22.260
Hart Montgomery: You know sure I don't see why they like we shouldn't do this in was there what's blocking the release.

51
00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:24.510
Cam Parra: I don't think we know the release process right.

52
00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.300
Hart Montgomery: yeah so Mike mostly did it.

53
00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:31.170
Hart Montgomery: Right, but I mean I think it's like.

54
00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:33.450
Hart Montgomery: You know I would.

55
00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:37.080
Hart Montgomery: Maybe send a mail to Mike and Rye.

56
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.720
Hart Montgomery: or send it to like maybe Community architects because right doesn't always like the.

57
00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:46.380
Hart Montgomery: Being individually nailed.

58
00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:50.880
Hart Montgomery: It it's probably worth paying Mike to.

59
00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:55.230
Cam Parra: Now right yeah and.

60
00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:58.710
Cam Parra: Have you got in contact with Mike Brown.

61
00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:06.870
Brent Zundel: i'm a little bit he kind of came out of the woodwork to look at and approve the last couple PR.

62
00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:15.570
Brent Zundel: So I can let me reach out to him just directly and see if he have time to walk me through the release process.

63
00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:20.520
Hart Montgomery: yeah this should be a time saver for him in the log correct right.

64
00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:23.250
Cam Parra: If if we can document it.

65
00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:33.030
Cam Parra: And that I think that would be that'd be great, and then we can just do it, like every couple weeks or if we can automate it that'd be that'd be even better.

66
00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:35.430
Hart Montgomery: So classic if you teach him to fish right.

67
00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:37.020
Cam Parra: yep.

68
00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:40.290
Hart Montgomery: So.

69
00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:46.620
Cam Parra: So yeah I think that's, the only thing that's holding us back I if I knew the release process i'd make a release right now.

70
00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:52.560
Hart Montgomery: yeah just talk to right good if Mike is not responsive, then we can talk to her, I or to another CO2.

71
00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:56.820
Brent Zundel: Okay, I can take that.

72
00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:02.010
Hart Montgomery: yeah but i'm sure my book, like this is not a big ask.

73
00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:08.550
Brent Zundel: is already responded this time tomorrow.

74
00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:16.620
Brent Zundel: awesome i'll get together with him document and do it, and next time we meet I can share that.

75
00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:18.630
Hart Montgomery: Thanks a lot.

76
00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:20.550
Cam Parra: Thanks Brent.

77
00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:23.430
Cam Parra: I will note that down.

78
00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:35.880
Cam Parra: And if you guys have Max but the new Max you can just click on the left or the right corner and you get little notes now.

79
00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:38.130
Hart Montgomery: How does your MAC.

80
00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:40.080
Cam Parra: And that's new.

81
00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:42.270
Hart Montgomery: I don't think I have that.

82
00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:48.930
Cam Parra: Right let's see so Brent will report.

83
00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:54.090
Cam Parra: On release process next meeting.

84
00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:57.840
Cam Parra: And I will merge the.

85
00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:04.860
Cam Parra: Core PR.

86
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:12.600
Cam Parra: And brand just a quick question all the all the PR for said go have been you've been able to merge them.

87
00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:19.770
Brent Zundel: I think I think all the critical ones, have been merged.

88
00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.170
Brent Zundel: I believe anything that's outstanding now is waiting for inverse or release.

89
00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:35.250
Cam Parra: Okay cool, do you know why i'm a vest is choosing to use ursa and not the crypto library that.

90
00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:39.240
Cam Parra: That the go folks were using before.

91
00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:43.800
Brent Zundel: i'm not sure I follow.

92
00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:50.070
Cam Parra: I believe that the Aries go rapper was not using are some.

93
00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:51.870
Brent Zundel: Oh areas framework go.

94
00:07:52.290 --> 00:08:00.630
Brent Zundel: yeah i'm areas framework go is starting to users, because areas framework go is getting an implementation of the non credit.

95
00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:02.340
Hart Montgomery: yeah.

96
00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:04.260
Hart Montgomery: The.

97
00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:11.070
Hart Montgomery: there's no like the biggest issue is there's no standard issue of integrates anywhere right.

98
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:18.630
Hart Montgomery: yeah like the go crypto code has like a lot of basic stuff but it doesn't have to have something like that.

99
00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:26.490
Cam Parra: So they're seeking to implement an on premise that in or seven, but I understand correctly.

100
00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:29.190
Hart Montgomery: yeah it's my understanding.

101
00:08:31.890 --> 00:08:35.490
Cam Parra: cool well I guess that brings us up to probably.

102
00:08:37.890 --> 00:08:39.900
Cam Parra: Getting that that.

103
00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:44.070
Cam Parra: Non creds bug fixed as soon as possible.

104
00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:55.650
Cam Parra: yeah that's also another thing that it was on my explain I don't know if he's too busy right now, or what progress he made maybe he can just donate us the code that he has.

105
00:08:56.160 --> 00:09:18.120
Cam Parra: Put it up as a PR and then maybe Alex says team, or some else someone else's team, who has russ knowledge can fix it or or review it and we can get that merged, but that is that the last missing piece in that vulnerability.

106
00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:22.290
Hart Montgomery: yeah I talked about the math solution with Mike.

107
00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:30.720
Hart Montgomery: So, like he started about it and yeah if he's too busy if the dsr guys think they can handle it.

108
00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:37.170
Hart Montgomery: Then it might be, you know mike's too busy it might be good to ask them do it.

109
00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:40.650
Hart Montgomery: it's a little bit tricky.

110
00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:52.560
Cam Parra: I think the math is is solid and I think the implementation well I that solid it's it's a solution, basically it's not the best solution it's not the worst solution, I.

111
00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:55.770
Hart Montgomery: guess it's certified solution, I mean just the problem is the.

112
00:09:56.760 --> 00:10:12.510
Hart Montgomery: The paper that describes it describes a proof, with a constant soundness property, so you have to amplify it right, so you have to basically run a bunch in parallel, which is fine, but you have to like remember to do that and it's like an efficiency thing, and all this other stuff right.

113
00:10:13.650 --> 00:10:14.280
Cam Parra: Right.

114
00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:17.820
Cam Parra: yeah and I guess Mike was concerned about the size of the proofs.

115
00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:19.980
Hart Montgomery: Is your size of the proofs are going to be large.

116
00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:22.920
Hart Montgomery: I think it was like megabyte or something.

117
00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:29.520
Cam Parra: yeah and I think there's solutions to probably.

118
00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:34.470
Cam Parra: Maybe compress that or where to store it and.

119
00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:44.730
Hart Montgomery: yeah if you have a blockchain right it's issuers right an issue is have to be you know there's some restrictions on issuers on the chain.

120
00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:50.970
Hart Montgomery: So you can just have like if the chain verifies the issue is public key.

121
00:10:52.410 --> 00:11:00.450
Hart Montgomery: Then they can just or they can just sort of like issue assigned statement on the blockchain say like this guy's kids good right.

122
00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:04.590
Hart Montgomery: Right and then, if you trust the blockchain which you have to anyway right.

123
00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:14.280
Hart Montgomery: You you know the you trust the that key is good, you just like verify the signature before you on this statement before us, the key or something like that right.

124
00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:19.140
Hart Montgomery: Now the issue with this approaches, you may have to like up the stack a little bit to.

125
00:11:21.270 --> 00:11:22.560
Hart Montgomery: To do this right because.

126
00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:26.250
Hart Montgomery: You sort of checking a property.

127
00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:27.810
Hart Montgomery: But.

128
00:11:29.010 --> 00:11:35.340
Hart Montgomery: it's like this, you know if you do this like this is a pretty straightforward solution if you have a blockchain right.

129
00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:39.720
Hart Montgomery: You do it once when the issuer.

130
00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:50.550
Hart Montgomery: is like starting on the block chain and then everyone only has to verify sites, David for the blockchain saying that this public use good.

131
00:11:51.810 --> 00:11:52.440
Cam Parra: Right.

132
00:11:54.360 --> 00:12:10.950
Cam Parra: And I think for the ursa group I don't think we have to worry about that implementation that much I think I think we just have to worry about having the code there to be able to and allowing it to be enabled in a non creds it should probably be optional to enable this.

133
00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:15.630
Hart Montgomery: yeah definitely what we it's going to be super expensive, so you don't want to have it.

134
00:12:17.190 --> 00:12:20.760
Hart Montgomery: run every time you use if you'd like make a phone call right.

135
00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:26.100
Cam Parra: yeah and i'm sure the iot folks won't want it and just various people won't want it, but.

136
00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:27.750
Cam Parra: it's needed.

137
00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:28.680
Cam Parra: It should be there.

138
00:12:29.970 --> 00:12:36.720
Cam Parra: But yeah again I think like we should just I think we should make that clear when we were when, if we do when we do get this code that.

139
00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:46.380
Cam Parra: yeah that we're not getting involved with the implementation, I think we'll leave that to probably like a vast folks are brand and his team or.

140
00:12:46.950 --> 00:12:49.290
Hart Montgomery: or just how how the check is done.

141
00:12:49.770 --> 00:12:51.600
Hart Montgomery: We can provide some suggestions.

142
00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:56.160
Hart Montgomery: But ultimately it's like up to them how they want to implement it right.

143
00:12:58.140 --> 00:13:03.000
Cam Parra: yeah and if there's a better solution that they can come up with i'm sure we'll be glad to hear it.

144
00:13:05.370 --> 00:13:09.870
Cam Parra: But yeah that's the only missing part is the Code, which is the most critical but.

145
00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:15.450
Cam Parra: Everything else is written up for them, everything else is set up, so if anyone wants to come in.

146
00:13:16.050 --> 00:13:25.890
Cam Parra: And I guess I should be more vocal about that to the areas group and to those other people who are stakeholders in this um and let them know that.

147
00:13:26.670 --> 00:13:33.900
Cam Parra: We just need someone to donate the code, but that the solution and the papers are all have been researched out and approved by the ursa group.

148
00:13:37.830 --> 00:13:44.160
Brent Zundel: So I can bring that up when I meet with Mike tomorrow, as well as to get his take on it and see about getting this quote.

149
00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:46.080
Brent Zundel: If there is some.

150
00:13:46.830 --> 00:13:50.280
Cam Parra: He mentioned he wrote some code and that's how he figured out.

151
00:13:53.220 --> 00:14:04.470
Cam Parra: How he figured out that it would be so large, and again I think that's not for us to worry about and maybe you can let him know that he doesn't have to worry about that we just need a solution.

152
00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:05.370
yeah.

153
00:14:10.290 --> 00:14:24.030
Cam Parra: cool well that's all I have, for my part, on yeah again if you need anything from for that, for I guess for that vulnerability then just Ping me on discord.

154
00:14:26.070 --> 00:14:42.930
Cam Parra: It I think this will be probably not I, I believe that the indie folks are finishing out their current do os vulnerability, and so I think this will probably be next on their roadmap if they're fixing vulnerabilities so we'll probably start getting some questions about it.

155
00:14:46.650 --> 00:14:52.230
Brent Zundel: yeah it's good to be a little closer to getting a solution.

156
00:14:53.490 --> 00:14:53.970
Cam Parra: Right.

157
00:14:58.950 --> 00:15:11.550
Cam Parra: From I don't know if you attended last the last do is meeting but but from the email it sounded like they were really close to releasing some or to deploying on their on their networks and so.

158
00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:14.670
Cam Parra: i'm sure we'll hear about a solution soon.

159
00:15:15.570 --> 00:15:22.320
Brent Zundel: yeah I mean sovereign just came out with a new round of updates to the ledger and I assumed that was part of it.

160
00:15:24.030 --> 00:15:27.600
Brent Zundel: Was it said they were fixing up have reported vulnerability.

161
00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:28.950
cool.

162
00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:40.710
Cam Parra: cool well I don't have anything else for you guys, do you have an anyone have anything else.
