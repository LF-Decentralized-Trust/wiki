Aleksandr Petrosyan: Hello, mysterious friend!

2
00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:44.570
Victor Gridnevsky: Hello, there!

3
00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:55.980
Victor Gridnevsky: So the meeting is present among the reminders. So

Victor Gridnevsky: people at them.

5
00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:01.750
Victor Gridnevsky: I don't know if they will. You know that we are early.

6
00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:06.799
Aleksandr Petrosyan: There's no place in in people if it's too early.

7
00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:08.860
Victor Gridnevsky: Okay. Okay.

8
00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:31.089
Dmitri Venger: Hello, my serious Stranger: I think we're alone again. Yeah, both. I'm about to text you. Um!

9
00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:34.650
Dmitri Venger: Is it a deliberate isolation,

10
00:09:34.690 --> 00:09:38.060
Dmitri Venger: or just professional negotiations?

11
00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:39.589
Aleksandr Petrosyan: No idea.

12
00:09:39.650 --> 00:09:41.710
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Um, both are possible.

13
00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:48.570
Dmitri Venger: I see more people are joining

14
00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:50.519
Aleksandr Petrosyan: there. We go.

15
00:09:56.010 --> 00:09:57.190
Victor Gridnevsky: Hello,

16
00:10:15.610 --> 00:10:19.449
Brent Zundel: hey! Everybody! Does anybody know who's uh leading this meeting?

17
00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:26.169
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Was this a question to us?

18
00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:35.610
Brent Zundel: I was being led by Cam. My understanding is that Cam is no longer

19
00:10:36.130 --> 00:10:38.350
Brent Zundel: able to participate.

20
00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:43.010
Brent Zundel: Um, I have

21
00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:48.740
Brent Zundel: uh overlapping meetings often enough that

22
00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:54.680
Brent Zundel: I don't. I couldn't commit to being the one to lead it regularly.

23
00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:57.250
Um.

24
00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:07.819
Brent Zundel: But perhaps for today we could at the very least go around and introduce ourselves and

25
00:11:09.490 --> 00:11:15.170
Brent Zundel: have a an Ursa focused conversation. I'm happy to leave that today. If folks don't mind

26
00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:22.780
alright,

27
00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.720
Aleksandr Petrosyan: this, we should start with

28
00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:29.389
Aleksandr Petrosyan: I'm saying that we

29
00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:32.729
Aleksandr Petrosyan: this is an unfortunate

30
00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:45.270
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Well, they usually needed a fire squad, and i'm your personal fire squad.

31
00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:54.140
Aleksandr Petrosyan: That meant that another project had to be put on. Hold! There's a coming deadline on that one

32
00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:57.919
Aleksandr Petrosyan: and a few people go six. So yeah,

33
00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:02.330
Aleksandr Petrosyan: i'm afraid I wasn't able to do. Was that what I was planning to do

34
00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:05.570
Aleksandr Petrosyan: which was actually introducing

35
00:12:06.530 --> 00:12:09.060
Aleksandr Petrosyan: instrumentation for um

36
00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:14.159
Aleksandr Petrosyan: basically um error handling

37
00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:16.300
Aleksandr Petrosyan: inside of Usa.

38
00:12:21.370 --> 00:12:23.439
Brent Zundel: Nice. Thank you, Alexander,

39
00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:29.559
Brent Zundel: just by way of introduction. My name is Brent.

40
00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:30.940
Brent Zundel: Um.

41
00:12:31.890 --> 00:12:38.430
Brent Zundel: I don't know the name of the company that I currently work for. Uh, it was as of last month. It was a vast,

42
00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:42.249
Brent Zundel: I think, technically right now. It's Norton lifelong,

43
00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:47.549
Brent Zundel: but within a week it's going to be something else, whatever they decide to name it. Um,

44
00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:51.489
Brent Zundel: my official title is Crypto Engineer.

45
00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:55.669
Brent Zundel: I spend most of my time having nothing to do with crypto engineering.

46
00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:56.960
Brent Zundel: Um!

47
00:12:57.170 --> 00:13:00.170
Brent Zundel: I spend most of my days in standards meetings

48
00:13:00.690 --> 00:13:05.899
Brent Zundel: specifically verifiable credentials. Decentralized identifiers, and such

49
00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:10.520
Brent Zundel: um versa holds a special place in my heart.

50
00:13:10.730 --> 00:13:12.780
Brent Zundel: Uh, It's some of the

51
00:13:13.530 --> 00:13:21.649
Brent Zundel: earliest work that we did at Evernham on the anonymous credentials eventually found its home here.

52
00:13:21.690 --> 00:13:25.039
Brent Zundel: Um! I would like to see it succeed as a project,

53
00:13:26.090 --> 00:13:27.290
Brent Zundel: and

54
00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:36.189
Brent Zundel: my boss has generously allowed me personally one hour a week toward that goal which generally means coming to this meeting.

55
00:13:37.470 --> 00:13:38.560
Brent Zundel: Um!

56
00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:45.809
Brent Zundel: That's me. If anybody else wants to say hello or introduce themselves, please unmute and do so.

59
00:14:08.020 --> 00:14:14.640
Dmitri Venger: tasks that may rise during the delivery of um, whether uh

Victor Gridnevsky: I guess it's my turn. So i'm Victor Community commander at so I meet them.

64
00:14:42.070 --> 00:14:54.360
Victor Gridnevsky: Uh, sometimes i'm helping with the code, and sometimes i'm helping with the communication. By the way, Is it all right if I ask a question, because I'm really interested in one part of our

65
00:14:55.450 --> 00:15:10.270
Victor Gridnevsky: Oh, I have no problem with you asking questions sure. So Steven Current and Michael order, and it seems like Michael will be on him uh other, any news on that but

66
00:15:11.430 --> 00:15:16.890
Brent Zundel: um uh beyond, I mean, I've had a couple of conversations with Mike. He's, hoping

67
00:15:17.190 --> 00:15:19.039
Brent Zundel: that his schedule will

68
00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:23.789
Brent Zundel: free up time for him to participate a little bit more fully. I've been encouraging him

69
00:15:23.850 --> 00:15:26.779
Brent Zundel: to participate a little bit more. Um!

70
00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:29.270

74
00:15:38.550 --> 00:15:49.729
Victor Gridnevsky: uh so course of him. Uh, i'm hoping i'll be able to invest more time into person, so it's not like, but there is hope.

75
00:15:50.490 --> 00:15:53.380
Victor Gridnevsky: So this was interesting for me,

76
00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:58.180
Victor Gridnevsky: and I

77
00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:00.349

Kim Ebert: i'm assuming you

86
00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:36.520
I can.

87
00:16:40.090 --> 00:16:41.350
Brent Zundel: All right.

88
00:16:41.390 --> 00:16:42.710
Brent Zundel: That was fun.

89
00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:44.120
Brent Zundel: Um,

90
00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:47.450
Brent Zundel: we have currently

91
00:16:47.850 --> 00:16:49.800
Brent Zundel: three open pull requests.

92
00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:58.549
Brent Zundel: I like in chat for those

93
00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:02.340
Brent Zundel: there.

94
00:17:02.770 --> 00:17:03.850
Brent Zundel: Um.

95
00:17:06.430 --> 00:17:08.279
Brent Zundel: Two of them

96
00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:10.950
Brent Zundel: are quite out of date

97
00:17:11.349 --> 00:17:13.169
Brent Zundel: opened by my clotter

98
00:17:14.650 --> 00:17:15.800
Brent Zundel: um

99
00:17:17.490 --> 00:17:19.759
Aleksandr Petrosyan: with one hundred and ninety-two

100
00:17:20.010 --> 00:17:22.190
Brent Zundel: um so one hundred and seventy

101
00:17:22.710 --> 00:17:23.849
Brent Zundel: um

102
00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:28.019
Brent Zundel: adds a pairings library, or suggests adding a pairings library.

103
00:17:28.089 --> 00:17:29.920
Brent Zundel: It makes changes to

104
00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:32.319
Brent Zundel: a lot of files

105
00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:34.760
Brent Zundel: as part of the Pr.

106
00:17:35.450 --> 00:17:36.540
Brent Zundel: Um.

107
00:17:37.290 --> 00:17:38.580
Brent Zundel: I

108
00:17:39.310 --> 00:17:41.479
Brent Zundel: reviewed it at one point,

109
00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:43.850
Brent Zundel: and then

110
00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:46.590
Brent Zundel: we

111
00:17:47.650 --> 00:17:49.570
Brent Zundel: had a bit of a conversation

112
00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:53.050
Brent Zundel: about exactly how

113
00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:55.940
Brent Zundel: you know the module should be hosted.

114
00:17:56.410 --> 00:17:57.550
Brent Zundel: Um!

115
00:18:00.050 --> 00:18:01.340
Brent Zundel: And

116
00:18:02.710 --> 00:18:07.149
Brent Zundel: then Mike kind of went dormant. And So this this pr has just sat

117
00:18:08.910 --> 00:18:10.660
Brent Zundel: uh for a long time

118
00:18:11.430 --> 00:18:14.789
Brent Zundel: since uh early two thousand and twenty-one. So

119
00:18:15.990 --> 00:18:17.050
Brent Zundel: um

120
00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:21.229
Aleksandr Petrosyan: uh early two thousand and twenty-two. It was updated on March second.

121
00:18:24.370 --> 00:18:31.529
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Uh: Yeah. So there's a few issues which I can think of the top of my head with it.

122
00:18:31.650 --> 00:18:35.060
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Uh for one. This you know I build is failing

123
00:18:35.110 --> 00:18:37.610
Aleksandr Petrosyan: um in any regard

124
00:18:38.710 --> 00:18:47.550
Aleksandr Petrosyan: I would not recommend, unless it's a really active repository in which you really know that the code that you're emerging is going to be fine.

125
00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:54.290
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Emerging without Cijs is extremely dangerous. This has to be put on ice temporarily, at least,

126
00:18:54.720 --> 00:19:00.459
Aleksandr Petrosyan: until the ci is fixed, or until we verify that the code itself isn't what's causing it to fail?

127
00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:06.399
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Um. Judging by the fact that one hundred and ninety-two, c. I checks do pass.

128
00:19:07.570 --> 00:19:10.150
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Um, I think it's the code that's the problem.

129
00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:19.680
Aleksandr Petrosyan: So reviewing it, we'll have to. Well, basically here's the Here's the problem with it.

130
00:19:19.910 --> 00:19:21.050
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Um,

131
00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:25.700
Aleksandr Petrosyan: If Michael or Mike. Michael Lauder is

132
00:19:26.210 --> 00:19:32.959
Aleksandr Petrosyan: unable to address those comments very quickly. Us, reviewing the code, would not expedite the process by a much

133
00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:44.759
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Um! What is it best distribution is to establish sort of a collaborative editing process where um we are committing direct suggestions which can fix the code

134
00:19:46.110 --> 00:19:51.620
Aleksandr Petrosyan: into an intermediate repository from which we create another pool. Request

135
00:19:52.350 --> 00:19:53.300
Aleksandr Petrosyan: um

136
00:19:54.270 --> 00:20:01.710
Aleksandr Petrosyan: after the pull request clears the ci or other. After we verify with the test which everyone in the C I have uh passing

137
00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:03.680
Aleksandr Petrosyan: um. We

138
00:20:03.910 --> 00:20:08.479
Aleksandr Petrosyan: suggest these changes to be called into his for,

139
00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:12.670
Aleksandr Petrosyan: and then I proceed with the call, request

140
00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:19.510
Aleksandr Petrosyan: it's a little bit long, but it it will get his attention, and it will. Shall we say, fix that?

141
00:20:20.570 --> 00:20:21.850
Aleksandr Petrosyan: It takes the issues,

142
00:20:23.860 --> 00:20:30.049
Aleksandr Petrosyan: the two hundred and three. That's the core changes in a little bit more problematic. Let's just say

143
00:20:30.820 --> 00:20:32.060
Aleksandr Petrosyan: um,

144
00:20:35.430 --> 00:20:39.469
Aleksandr Petrosyan: At least they're problematic for us. They might not be for

145
00:20:40.510 --> 00:20:46.189
Aleksandr Petrosyan: to some people. But basically the the issue that we're having is the fact, for fail is deprecated,

146
00:20:46.750 --> 00:20:52.540
Aleksandr Petrosyan: and the longer we wait for this active, the more at the Mo code we add with it active,

147
00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:56.819
Aleksandr Petrosyan: the more code will need to be changed to this peak.

148
00:20:58.270 --> 00:21:01.449
Aleksandr Petrosyan: So might make sense to

149
00:21:02.390 --> 00:21:07.220
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Well, actually. No, it's it's a relatively small here,

150
00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:11.719
Aleksandr Petrosyan: so I don't see much of a problem with matching it.

151
00:21:13.410 --> 00:21:15.650
Aleksandr Petrosyan: I do think that it needs to be

152
00:21:17.250 --> 00:21:19.370
Aleksandr Petrosyan: well. It it has the approvals.

153
00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:26.720
Aleksandr Petrosyan: So oh, actually it it has had to approve since August the fourth.

154
00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:31.439
Brent Zundel: Yeah. And at that time

155
00:21:31.670 --> 00:21:34.920
Brent Zundel: we reached out to Cam because there were merge conflicts,

156
00:21:35.550 --> 00:21:39.899
Brent Zundel: and he has not since then had the time to address them.

157
00:21:41.660 --> 00:21:44.089
Brent Zundel: Um! I just today

158
00:21:44.230 --> 00:21:47.759
Brent Zundel: updated it from Main, and we'll see

159
00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:54.589
Brent Zundel: if the the checks complete and what these conflicts look like.

160
00:21:54.610 --> 00:21:55.700
Brent Zundel: But if

161
00:21:55.780 --> 00:21:57.660
Brent Zundel: cam isn't available

162
00:21:58.220 --> 00:22:00.310
Brent Zundel: to address the conflicts himself

163
00:22:00.790 --> 00:22:01.870
Brent Zundel: Um!

164
00:22:02.490 --> 00:22:05.099
Brent Zundel: From what I can tell, he did not,

165
00:22:05.290 --> 00:22:07.999
Brent Zundel: you know, check the box that allows

166
00:22:08.830 --> 00:22:14.110
Brent Zundel: others to make changes to his. Pr. So I can't jump in and try to,

167
00:22:15.170 --> 00:22:17.120
Brent Zundel: you know. Fix the conflicts.

168
00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:20.930
Brent Zundel: I don't think we have a choice at that point other than to close the Pr:

169
00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:24.720
Aleksandr Petrosyan: We have one Internet choice.

170
00:22:29.770 --> 00:22:32.660
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Um, create a separate yeah parallel with

171
00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:37.070
Aleksandr Petrosyan: um changes rebased from the pull request that is active.

172
00:22:37.310 --> 00:22:45.210
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Um, but like I said, it's the same process. Um, um! They create a Pr. From x to uh home.

173
00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:51.030
Aleksandr Petrosyan: What we do then is we take X. We create another fork on top of X.

174
00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:53.279
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Call it Why we fix,

175
00:22:53.640 --> 00:23:00.250
Aleksandr Petrosyan: we create a call request from why it's at home. We make sure that the poor request passes all checks, and it passes. Review,

176
00:23:00.950 --> 00:23:04.649
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Then, when y is clear to merge,

177
00:23:05.230 --> 00:23:11.159
Aleksandr Petrosyan: we close from y to home, we open from one to X, and then we merge X to home.

178
00:23:11.990 --> 00:23:14.090
Aleksandr Petrosyan: I'll say, why is it?

179
00:23:18.450 --> 00:23:31.070
Aleksandr Petrosyan: It's a round trip, but if you have lots of people who are extremely busy, I pull request this is their own repository, something that shows up in the mailbox. A commons on the pull request into another repository can be filter that,

180
00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:34.169
Aleksandr Petrosyan: and most people in all that,

181
00:23:34.530 --> 00:23:38.959
Aleksandr Petrosyan: especially if they uh have lots of other work related to Github.

182
00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:44.979
Brent Zundel: I think that that strategy could very well work with Mike's. Pr.

183
00:23:45.190 --> 00:23:48.930
Brent Zundel: I'm not as confident that it could work with cams

184
00:23:50.590 --> 00:23:52.120
Aleksandr Petrosyan: uh What's the issue?

185
00:23:52.790 --> 00:23:56.299
Brent Zundel: Um, I can ping Mike and say, Hey, Mike,

186
00:23:56.970 --> 00:24:01.759
Brent Zundel: we have A. Pr. On your Pr. To fix all the merge conflicts and get it up to date.

187
00:24:01.850 --> 00:24:04.300
Brent Zundel: Review it, and he'll take the time to do that.

188
00:24:04.430 --> 00:24:07.539
Brent Zundel: I don't have the same confidence that Cam would act.

189
00:24:12.250 --> 00:24:13.490
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Okay.

190
00:24:13.790 --> 00:24:16.550
Another option is to just uh rewrite. It.

191
00:24:16.950 --> 00:24:19.419
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Contents of the Pr. From ground up

192
00:24:22.330 --> 00:24:25.430
Aleksandr Petrosyan: that duplicates what? But it gets the code in.

193
00:24:38.900 --> 00:24:41.340
Brent Zundel: So i'm not opposed to people doing work.

194
00:24:42.100 --> 00:24:51.440
Brent Zundel: Um! I personally would rather enjoy being someone who had the capacity to per participate and contribute. Unfortunately,

195
00:24:51.530 --> 00:24:53.240
Brent Zundel: at this time I don't

196
00:24:53.690 --> 00:24:54.760
Brent Zundel: um,

197
00:24:55.500 --> 00:25:02.779
Brent Zundel: so it's unfair for me to say who's going to do this because I can't raise my hand, but life's unfair. So who's going to do this?

198
00:25:04.550 --> 00:25:10.460
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Um! We were planning to work on us. Uh? We have to start somewhere, so might as well.

199
00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:16.339
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Um. But I do have a feeling that it might just ask the Ci checks, and that's it.

200
00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:21.289
Aleksandr Petrosyan: So Um, let's not turn this into an issue before it is one.

201
00:25:21.510 --> 00:25:22.340
Brent Zundel: Okay,

202
00:25:23.370 --> 00:25:26.539
Aleksandr Petrosyan: because um like,

203
00:25:26.780 --> 00:25:31.559
Aleksandr Petrosyan: let's be completely honest. What are the odds that the person that created this

204
00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:35.979
Aleksandr Petrosyan: was too lazy to just one cargo test and and do that

205
00:25:36.990 --> 00:25:40.749
Aleksandr Petrosyan: and cargo audit, is It's going to be tough to fix

206
00:25:45.590 --> 00:25:47.079
It's It's actually why we

207
00:25:48.630 --> 00:25:49.580
Brent Zundel: Hmm.

208
00:25:49.630 --> 00:25:52.689
Brent Zundel: Another option moving forward or for moving forward

209
00:25:53.010 --> 00:25:54.350
Brent Zundel: is to

210
00:25:55.940 --> 00:26:00.759
Brent Zundel: close all of these pr's without merging, and simply begin the work,

211
00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:04.760
Brent Zundel: as has been described and defined.

212
00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:12.650
Aleksandr Petrosyan: You're referring to the

213
00:26:18.550 --> 00:26:22.350
Aleksandr Petrosyan: for the present uh given that the has joined us.

214
00:26:24.510 --> 00:26:29.719
Hart Montgomery: I hard. Uh, hey? Yeah, sorry. And I have to drop soon. And unfortunately, too, I have like

215
00:26:29.830 --> 00:26:31.160
Hart Montgomery: triple booked

216
00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:36.890
Hart Montgomery: um. The roadmap is Basically, the same as before. Right. Is there any? Are there any substantial changes?

217
00:26:37.810 --> 00:26:39.879
Aleksandr Petrosyan: We Well,

218
00:26:40.140 --> 00:26:44.330
Aleksandr Petrosyan: not specifically. It's just the people that points. Is um.

219
00:26:45.180 --> 00:26:46.779
Aleksandr Petrosyan: We factor it from

220
00:26:46.830 --> 00:26:49.789
Aleksandr Petrosyan: one big library, with lots of features into

221
00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:53.729
Aleksandr Petrosyan: smaller libraries and a wrapping library which combines them.

222
00:26:54.550 --> 00:26:57.330
Hart Montgomery: Um, that's fantastic.

223
00:26:57.580 --> 00:27:01.819
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Um, that's a our handling library. Um called me yet,

224
00:27:02.060 --> 00:27:10.369
Aleksandr Petrosyan: which can give very nice looking at our reports if you uh look it up on Docs Alask. It has fantastic looking at the messages

225
00:27:11.250 --> 00:27:18.620
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Um! With good practices as well to explain to the person who is seeing what they should do about it.

226
00:27:19.220 --> 00:27:22.669
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Um, we're in process of moving, you know, to the library.

227
00:27:22.910 --> 00:27:25.779
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Um, so far as being a smooth, open replacement.

228
00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:33.970
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Um,

229
00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:35.000
Aleksandr Petrosyan: yes,

230
00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:43.969
Hart Montgomery: yeah. Is. Do you have this written down anywhere? I I can assume you do. That's a rhetorical question. Can you send me the link

231
00:27:44.270 --> 00:27:45.949
Aleksandr Petrosyan: to the uh

232
00:27:46.180 --> 00:27:48.960
Hart Montgomery: to whatever you down on the roadmap? Yeah,

233
00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:02.420
Hart Montgomery: that'd be fantastic.

234
00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:06.190
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Okay, Good. Um, i'll send it via this quote: Right?

235
00:28:06.650 --> 00:28:08.310
Hart Montgomery: Yeah. Just courts Great:

236
00:28:08.540 --> 00:28:09.610
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Yeah, Good.

237
00:28:10.130 --> 00:28:22.029
Hart Montgomery: Um, I do have to drop, unfortunately. But yeah, everyone if you need me for anything, you know. Just mail me um. Always happy to talk, always happy to mail, so I I apologize for having to drop. But

238
00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:27.620
Hart Montgomery: Um, Also, Is there an Aries meeting, or something that conflicts with this time,

239
00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:32.970
Hart Montgomery: Brett? Do you know

240
00:28:35.660 --> 00:28:39.929
Brent Zundel: I am speaking well muted? Um, I do not know. It's possible.

241
00:28:40.190 --> 00:28:45.809
Hart Montgomery: Okay, because Steven posted in chat that he's, hey? I'd love to join the meeting, but I can't.

242
00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:47.490
Um.

243
00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:53.949
Hart Montgomery: So maybe we like rotate or adjust the meeting time, so we can get those guys to attend.

244
00:28:57.770 --> 00:29:02.140
Hart Montgomery: I'll reach out, and i'll try to start out a threat on this if that's okay with everybody.

245
00:29:05.430 --> 00:29:06.729
Hart Montgomery: So it's all good.

246
00:29:07.110 --> 00:29:08.540
Brent Zundel: Yeah, that's fine. Thank you.

247
00:29:09.550 --> 00:29:17.030
Hart Montgomery: All right. I unfortunately do have to drop so sorry about that. Thank you all, and let me know if you need anything.

248
00:29:17.050 --> 00:29:18.140
Okay,

249
00:29:18.340 --> 00:29:19.370
Bye, bye,

250
00:29:25.630 --> 00:29:26.700
Aleksandr Petrosyan: that was.

251
00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:31.229
Aleksandr Petrosyan: It was a quick enough. Um! We have some good news,

252
00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:33.180
Aleksandr Petrosyan: I think

253
00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:36.620
Aleksandr Petrosyan: two hundred and three is,

254
00:29:41.370 --> 00:29:46.160
Aleksandr Petrosyan: except for a few right, except for a few conflicts, it should be fine

255
00:29:49.870 --> 00:29:52.599
Aleksandr Petrosyan: just doesn't say which which are those conflicts?

256
00:29:52.650 --> 00:29:54.489
Brent Zundel: Right? That's the

257
00:29:57.310 --> 00:30:05.570
Brent Zundel: that is the challenge. I and I can't just jump in and do it for him. This is the what we've run around and run into with this since August.

258
00:30:07.290 --> 00:30:13.160
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Um! I don't quite understand why that's the case with us about

259
00:30:13.510 --> 00:30:18.919
Aleksandr Petrosyan: um. Maybe it's the post protection. This is causing problems. But, um,

260
00:30:20.070 --> 00:30:26.000
Aleksandr Petrosyan: as far as we can, we require a few things to be met.

261
00:30:26.250 --> 00:30:28.430
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Um specifically the um,

262
00:30:28.750 --> 00:30:35.550
Aleksandr Petrosyan: like almost all um big open source projects we require re based on a much workflow.

263
00:30:36.220 --> 00:30:44.900
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Um. We have a guideline on commits, so what should be a separate commit which should be just? Um amended into the previous one,

264
00:30:45.460 --> 00:30:50.429
Aleksandr Petrosyan: and on instant fix up as well. Dco: obviously,

265
00:30:50.610 --> 00:30:54.160
Aleksandr Petrosyan: and a few things pertaining to that.

266
00:30:54.210 --> 00:30:56.430
Aleksandr Petrosyan: If you are opening a pull request

267
00:30:57.340 --> 00:31:01.080
Aleksandr Petrosyan: from a personal fork, and you're a new contributor.

268
00:31:01.650 --> 00:31:06.700
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Um, you should expect um to be available for. Uh

269
00:31:07.050 --> 00:31:09.480
Aleksandr Petrosyan: addressing the code review questions,

270
00:31:09.860 --> 00:31:16.009
Aleksandr Petrosyan: if there are any, and if you don't respond within a month, then we just close the pull request automatically.

271
00:31:16.580 --> 00:31:20.800
Aleksandr Petrosyan: I would imagine if that was the case with us, so there would be no requests but

272
00:31:21.540 --> 00:31:22.600
Aleksandr Petrosyan: um.

273
00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:28.710
Aleksandr Petrosyan: But aside from that there's also another thing which we practice, which is, if you

274
00:31:29.050 --> 00:31:35.100
Aleksandr Petrosyan: ah, shall we say a person who contributes frequently?

275
00:31:35.250 --> 00:31:45.009
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Um, you're doing these either via um feature branches to which you have unprotected access. So anyone else can

276
00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:50.210
Aleksandr Petrosyan: do those changes if they need to. And if you're using personal forks, which is

277
00:31:50.530 --> 00:31:59.960
Aleksandr Petrosyan: as far as in the standard we've been hyper manager. Um, you are supposed to add, have? Well, at least the current code owners has collaborators.

278
00:32:01.420 --> 00:32:06.400
Aleksandr Petrosyan: So if people need to get your pull request in quickly. They can do that.

279
00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:08.660
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Um,

280
00:32:08.830 --> 00:32:16.669
Aleksandr Petrosyan: i'm not sure that um you well given what you've said. You can do that with Cam. But you can definitely ask Michael to do that.

281
00:32:24.030 --> 00:32:25.609
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Do you think that could work?

282
00:32:26.510 --> 00:32:29.130
Brent Zundel: Uh, yeah, with Mike's definitely,

283
00:32:34.430 --> 00:32:37.279
Brent Zundel: I mean, i'm willing to try to reach out to cam again.

284
00:32:37.730 --> 00:32:38.670
Brent Zundel: But

285
00:32:40.540 --> 00:32:42.419
Aleksandr Petrosyan: we've been trying to do the same thing.

286
00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:44.959
Aleksandr Petrosyan: And since around you

287
00:32:45.870 --> 00:32:49.099
Aleksandr Petrosyan: this is actually why we here um, we,

288
00:32:55.290 --> 00:32:56.849
Aleksandr Petrosyan: and

289
00:32:57.810 --> 00:32:58.700
Aleksandr Petrosyan: it

290
00:32:58.730 --> 00:33:02.920
Aleksandr Petrosyan: didn't seem like anything was happening with Github, so

291
00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:06.689
Aleksandr Petrosyan: got a little worried. We got in touch with Brian. He

292
00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:20.729
Aleksandr Petrosyan: and the code base is nice um plus contributing to a cryptographic library something everyone wants to.

293
00:33:21.350 --> 00:33:22.440
Aleksandr Petrosyan: So

294
00:33:22.550 --> 00:33:23.520
Aleksandr Petrosyan: yeah,

295
00:33:24.660 --> 00:33:28.580
Aleksandr Petrosyan: I decided, we try to help.

296
00:33:39.260 --> 00:33:41.190
Brent Zundel: I think we've gone

297
00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:44.590
Brent Zundel: as far as we can on the Prs today.

298
00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:48.049
Brent Zundel: Um! I'll reach out to cam

299
00:33:48.390 --> 00:33:50.670
Brent Zundel: uh what's more, about

300
00:33:50.740 --> 00:33:52.339
Brent Zundel: two hundred and three.

301
00:33:53.260 --> 00:33:56.070
Brent Zundel: See if he's willing to

302
00:33:56.140 --> 00:33:59.069
Brent Zundel: do the first conflicts.

303
00:34:06.900 --> 00:34:10.579
Brent Zundel: I can also reach out to Mike.

304
00:34:21.870 --> 00:34:26.660
Brent Zundel: Uh, and with that i'd like to move to issues unless folks have

305
00:34:28.610 --> 00:34:30.770
Brent Zundel: concerns about that direction.

306
00:34:40.449 --> 00:34:41.699
All right,

307
00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:46.300
Brent Zundel: posting a link to the issues in the order that i'm going to go through them.

308
00:34:47.230 --> 00:34:48.339
Brent Zundel: Um!

309
00:34:49.810 --> 00:34:51.570
Brent Zundel: What I would like

310
00:34:52.030 --> 00:34:55.920
Brent Zundel: us to focus on as a conversation is

311
00:34:55.949 --> 00:34:57.080
Brent Zundel: um,

312
00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:06.640
Brent Zundel: and whether we're going to do anything about it, versus whether or not

313
00:35:06.730 --> 00:35:07.819
Brent Zundel: um

314
00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:12.790
Brent Zundel: versus solutioning or trying to solve the solve the issue. So

315
00:35:12.810 --> 00:35:15.839
Brent Zundel: beginning with issue one hundred and thirty-one

316
00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:21.090
Brent Zundel: uh playing around with this library tried to build in portable mode.

317
00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:22.439
Brent Zundel: Um

318
00:35:24.090 --> 00:35:27.890
Brent Zundel: compiling, according to the directions. Cargo fails,

319
00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:34.329
Brent Zundel: Mike responded. A couple of years ago. We need to update the documentation,

320
00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:38.770
Brent Zundel: and then gives

321
00:35:39.110 --> 00:35:44.660
Brent Zundel: a command that theoretically would work no response from the poster

322
00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:49.899
Brent Zundel: uh thoughts, opinions. What if anything, should we do about this issue.

323
00:35:52.130 --> 00:35:53.580
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Update documentation.

324
00:35:55.230 --> 00:36:01.359
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Um. Also make sure that it works because this was posted on July the ninth of two thousand and twenty.

325
00:36:03.870 --> 00:36:08.800
Aleksandr Petrosyan: So let's make sure that we have a working solution.

326
00:36:09.620 --> 00:36:12.709
Aleksandr Petrosyan: That should be easy. Then we should

327
00:36:13.170 --> 00:36:15.279
Aleksandr Petrosyan: updated documentation and so on.

328
00:36:18.820 --> 00:36:21.719
Brent Zundel: All right. I'll put a note in the issue.

329
00:36:34.670 --> 00:36:46.389
Brent Zundel: Uh, is there anyone who would be willing to be assigned to this issue to bring it toward completion, which would include testing the posted solution? Make sure it works, and then updating the documentation with that solution.

330
00:36:47.570 --> 00:36:54.680
Victor Gridnevsky: At least, I would like to help with the documentation, and I will try to do the tests.

331
00:36:54.750 --> 00:36:56.049
Victor Gridnevsky: Listen to me

332
00:36:57.020 --> 00:37:01.289
Brent Zundel: right, Victor. What is your github handle?

333
00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:04.810
Victor Gridnevsky: One moment. I'm gonna send the link as well.

334
00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:14.470
Brent Zundel: I have you uh attached uh assigned to the issue.

335
00:37:15.300 --> 00:37:17.329
Victor Gridnevsky: Yes, yes, correct.

336
00:37:18.680 --> 00:37:20.930
Brent Zundel: All right. Next one

337
00:37:21.950 --> 00:37:25.910
Brent Zundel: uh feature this is issue one hundred and thirty-nine.

338
00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:27.370
Brent Zundel: Um.

339
00:37:29.110 --> 00:37:40.720
Brent Zundel: Now that we have a seek hullable library interface two years ago. How about we go? Step further with help of go, see, go to pride a go laying one. I think that this issue is

340
00:37:40.780 --> 00:37:47.089
Brent Zundel: remarkably stale, considering that we have an sa go library now, or it's a wrapper.

341
00:37:47.230 --> 00:37:49.209
Brent Zundel: Um, so

342
00:37:49.630 --> 00:37:54.720
Brent Zundel: i'm going to close it with a comment to that effect, unless someone feels otherwise

343
00:38:06.450 --> 00:38:07.299
right.

344
00:38:07.510 --> 00:38:10.229
Brent Zundel: I will do that

345
00:38:11.750 --> 00:38:14.290
Brent Zundel: after the meetings we don't have to take time. Now,

346
00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:18.320
Brent Zundel: next one is number one.

347
00:38:19.590 --> 00:38:23.099
Brent Zundel: Forty-eight change log is out of date

348
00:38:23.900 --> 00:38:31.099
Brent Zundel: as part of Cii badging we need. We do claim to have a change log. Seems we're forgetting to update it.

349
00:38:32.920 --> 00:38:35.950
Brent Zundel: Um! So this is more documentation.

350
00:38:40.220 --> 00:38:44.169
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Um, I'd probably add to this.

351
00:38:44.490 --> 00:38:48.270
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Why are you not generating the change log automatically?

352
00:38:53.570 --> 00:38:54.629
Aleksandr Petrosyan: So

353
00:38:54.690 --> 00:39:03.379
Aleksandr Petrosyan: uh to some extent? Um, if we are to? Or shall we say? Take over the development? Um.

354
00:39:03.750 --> 00:39:10.809
Aleksandr Petrosyan: The commits format standard is such that you could generate the change log based of the of of just the commit history.

355
00:39:11.670 --> 00:39:18.540
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Um! There will be an older change one which will stay um just to it You get appended an extra

356
00:39:18.670 --> 00:39:19.940
Aleksandr Petrosyan: instead of changes.

357
00:39:20.280 --> 00:39:26.950
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Um! You could also host Two change locks, one for the version before the

358
00:39:27.940 --> 00:39:29.650
Aleksandr Petrosyan: I don't want to say hostile, but

359
00:39:30.650 --> 00:39:33.959
Aleksandr Petrosyan: the change to the commit standard,

360
00:39:34.440 --> 00:39:37.270
Aleksandr Petrosyan: and the one after which is automatically generated.

361
00:39:42.930 --> 00:39:46.270
Brent Zundel: I agree that as a path forward that sounds fantastic.

362
00:39:48.550 --> 00:39:49.700
Brent Zundel: Um!

363
00:39:52.380 --> 00:39:56.019
Brent Zundel: Is there someone willing to be assigned to that task to make it happen.

364
00:39:57.570 --> 00:39:59.119
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Um, i'd like to

365
00:40:10.510 --> 00:40:13.349
Brent Zundel: alright, I have assigned you to the issue.

366
00:40:13.670 --> 00:40:14.569
Okay,

367
00:40:15.210 --> 00:40:16.149
Brent Zundel: you

368
00:40:23.690 --> 00:40:25.779
Brent Zundel: alright, next issue

369
00:40:26.980 --> 00:40:28.100
Brent Zundel: um

370
00:40:29.960 --> 00:40:33.379
Brent Zundel: as of July the twenty second, two thousand and twenty.

371
00:40:35.190 --> 00:40:36.680
This is

372
00:40:38.740 --> 00:40:40.140
Brent Zundel: It's the roadmap.

373
00:40:41.300 --> 00:40:43.989
Brent Zundel: Um. I would encourage folks to

374
00:40:44.320 --> 00:40:45.779
Brent Zundel: follow that link

375
00:40:46.550 --> 00:40:47.740
Brent Zundel: um,

376
00:40:48.040 --> 00:40:52.420
Brent Zundel: and see if the list of to do their

377
00:40:53.180 --> 00:40:59.659
Brent Zundel: make any sense at all, considering what folks are currently and want to do with the

378
00:41:03.530 --> 00:41:05.919
Brent Zundel: that folks are like, I can share my screen.

379
00:41:06.830 --> 00:41:08.139
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Yes, please

380
00:41:08.420 --> 00:41:09.270
Brent Zundel: problem

381
00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:12.040
Brent Zundel: alright,

382
00:41:12.070 --> 00:41:13.740
Brent Zundel: versa roadmap

383
00:41:17.220 --> 00:41:19.029
Brent Zundel: as hub two years ago.

384
00:41:20.490 --> 00:41:21.770
Brent Zundel: Current features.

385
00:41:22.340 --> 00:41:23.830
Brent Zundel: There's some signatures.

386
00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:28.700
Brent Zundel: We have some key. Exchange,

387
00:41:29.370 --> 00:41:30.819
Brent Zundel: a bit of encryption

388
00:41:32.620 --> 00:41:36.939
Brent Zundel: and the cks which is essentially the an on-premise code

389
00:41:37.140 --> 00:41:39.110
Brent Zundel: and some superior secret sharing.

390
00:41:40.650 --> 00:41:43.290
Brent Zundel: There is a little of Z next library

391
00:41:43.510 --> 00:41:50.950
Brent Zundel: which is separate from live versa, for historical reasons, that, in my opinion, are No, no one or pertinent.

392
00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:52.800
Brent Zundel: I think we've talked about that

393
00:41:53.090 --> 00:41:57.720
Brent Zundel: which has Bvs plus fontable, Sanders some bulletproofs code,

394
00:41:58.370 --> 00:42:01.690
Brent Zundel: along with some verifiable encryption and delegateable signatures

395
00:42:03.910 --> 00:42:05.350
Brent Zundel: the to do list

396
00:42:05.570 --> 00:42:08.089
Brent Zundel: as a couple of years ago includes these things,

397
00:42:09.200 --> 00:42:11.139
Brent Zundel: adding a depth secret, sharing,

398
00:42:12.310 --> 00:42:14.310
Brent Zundel: improving the

399
00:42:15.050 --> 00:42:16.689
Brent Zundel: according to the Rfc.

400
00:42:17.490 --> 00:42:21.069
Brent Zundel: Adjusting the Bls curve so that it meets the spec

401
00:42:22.380 --> 00:42:25.770
Brent Zundel: with a change from the Ncl. To the parenting plus library,

402
00:42:28.430 --> 00:42:31.009
Brent Zundel: introducing a threshold Bls signature,

403
00:42:32.070 --> 00:42:34.550
Brent Zundel: and then changing to a subsequent model

404
00:42:36.770 --> 00:42:41.289
Brent Zundel: which is in line with, but probably not exactly the same thing as

405
00:42:41.610 --> 00:42:42.669
Brent Zundel: um

406
00:42:43.430 --> 00:42:45.020
Brent Zundel: the

407
00:42:45.390 --> 00:42:47.500
Brent Zundel: precisely what we want to do.

408
00:42:47.720 --> 00:42:55.329
Brent Zundel: Right We it so it's. It's been a twinkle in our eyes for a very long time, literally when you came to the meeting and said, This is what we want to do.

409
00:42:55.660 --> 00:43:01.700
Brent Zundel: We're not having to bend over backwards to get to agree with. We want that to happen to

410
00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:05.440
Brent Zundel: um. It seems a much better architecture.

411
00:43:06.160 --> 00:43:07.229
Brent Zundel: Um.

412
00:43:08.910 --> 00:43:12.679
Brent Zundel: Separation of the Cl. Rsa. And Cks

413
00:43:13.120 --> 00:43:14.180
um,

414
00:43:15.900 --> 00:43:19.759
Brent Zundel: as well as some fresh signatures, some more accumulator work

415
00:43:20.150 --> 00:43:24.110
Brent Zundel: was very interesting at the time.

416
00:43:24.740 --> 00:43:28.370
Brent Zundel: I know that some of that has happened independent of.

417
00:43:28.420 --> 00:43:30.450
Brent Zundel: And I've actually been talking with

418
00:43:30.630 --> 00:43:33.880
Brent Zundel: Mike to talk to you about getting it into.

419
00:43:34.700 --> 00:43:37.729
Brent Zundel: I don't know if that will happen

420
00:43:38.770 --> 00:43:43.800
Brent Zundel: um as well as these are other crypto things happening elsewhere that

421
00:43:44.700 --> 00:43:47.219
Brent Zundel: we thought would be cool to be in

422
00:43:47.650 --> 00:43:50.410
Brent Zundel: um privacy pass integrations.

423
00:43:51.650 --> 00:43:53.980
Brent Zundel: Um different hashing algorithms.

424
00:43:55.700 --> 00:43:59.659
Brent Zundel: Um. These are the roughly the sub crates that we had

425
00:43:59.980 --> 00:44:04.600
Brent Zundel: broken things into along with the compile targets that we wanted to aim for.

426
00:44:05.770 --> 00:44:08.030
Brent Zundel: Um, all of which is, of course

427
00:44:09.100 --> 00:44:10.359
Brent Zundel: up for

428
00:44:10.690 --> 00:44:12.089
Brent Zundel: for the conversation.

429
00:44:12.750 --> 00:44:15.789
Brent Zundel: So as of two years ago, this was roughly roadmap.

430
00:44:17.120 --> 00:44:19.579
Brent Zundel: Um. The question

431
00:44:19.820 --> 00:44:22.310
Brent Zundel: for us today is,

432
00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:28.219
Brent Zundel: does it make sense to keep this issue open with this roadmap,

433
00:44:29.440 --> 00:44:31.810
Brent Zundel: or recognize that

434
00:44:32.390 --> 00:44:33.560
Brent Zundel: we

435
00:44:35.590 --> 00:44:36.879
Brent Zundel: have

436
00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:40.490
Brent Zundel: a similar more up to date.

437
00:44:41.050 --> 00:44:44.680
Brent Zundel: And perhaps at this point we should just close this issue.

438
00:44:50.610 --> 00:44:51.529
Brent Zundel: But

439
00:44:55.140 --> 00:45:00.629
Brent Zundel: we're referring to which issue specifically,

440
00:45:01.230 --> 00:45:04.370
Brent Zundel: it says, here's our roadmap. Let's do it.

441
00:45:05.030 --> 00:45:09.509
Brent Zundel: Um. I think that there are laudable things on that roadmap,

442
00:45:10.260 --> 00:45:12.109
Brent Zundel: but It is two years old,

443
00:45:12.740 --> 00:45:23.810
Brent Zundel: and in light of the conversations we've had more recently, though some of it is. I don't personally feel like it makes sense to modify this old roadmap.

444
00:45:23.850 --> 00:45:28.039
Brent Zundel: I'd rather just close this issue and say, here's the new roadmap.

445
00:45:30.170 --> 00:45:33.049
Aleksandr Petrosyan: I wouldn't go so far as that. Um,

446
00:45:33.220 --> 00:45:36.809
Aleksandr Petrosyan: I think we can just rearrange

447
00:45:36.850 --> 00:45:40.300
Aleksandr Petrosyan: the stuff inside of the Ford road map and fix that

448
00:45:40.440 --> 00:45:42.140
Aleksandr Petrosyan: like um.

449
00:45:42.160 --> 00:45:47.520
Aleksandr Petrosyan: One thing that you couldn't have accounted for is the fact that some of the libraries that you relied on were deprecated.

450
00:45:48.030 --> 00:45:51.220
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Those could just easily be added as a separate bullet point.

451
00:45:51.870 --> 00:45:56.590
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Um! As for the upgrade model, this is what we want as well

452
00:45:56.610 --> 00:46:05.020
Aleksandr Petrosyan: will simplify everyone's life. It stays the remainder. Zero knowledge proofs the decoupling.

453
00:46:05.670 --> 00:46:07.680
Aleksandr Petrosyan: It might happen accidentally

454
00:46:08.420 --> 00:46:15.480
Aleksandr Petrosyan: in a sense that sometimes, if you think about the data flow, you just realize that you have to either

455
00:46:15.820 --> 00:46:18.350
Aleksandr Petrosyan: drawing the line in the wrong place.

456
00:46:19.520 --> 00:46:20.720
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Um,

457
00:46:22.540 --> 00:46:32.500
Aleksandr Petrosyan: The improvements which um will need to be implemented eventually need to be implemented otherwise. Um as a office uh

458
00:46:33.170 --> 00:46:35.229
Aleksandr Petrosyan: less reliable

459
00:46:36.360 --> 00:46:39.300
Aleksandr Petrosyan: key exchange signatures, et cetera.

460
00:46:40.230 --> 00:46:41.310
Aleksandr Petrosyan: I'm. Not

461
00:46:41.470 --> 00:46:45.640
Aleksandr Petrosyan: one. Her essential whether they will be on top priority. Given that we,

462
00:46:46.110 --> 00:46:52.620
Aleksandr Petrosyan: then we have that much of a reliance on the reliability of us that we needed to be economic first

463
00:47:02.330 --> 00:47:03.670
Aleksandr Petrosyan: to improve.

464
00:47:04.430 --> 00:47:10.769
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Um. It is quite possible that we will have time to implement it as well,

465
00:47:11.480 --> 00:47:12.390
Aleksandr Petrosyan: just

466
00:47:12.500 --> 00:47:14.290
Aleksandr Petrosyan: maybe not in the near future.

467
00:47:14.390 --> 00:47:19.640
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Keeping it in a roadmap is fine, just adjusting it slightly, so that it

468
00:47:21.600 --> 00:47:23.529
Aleksandr Petrosyan: well, it's a lack of a better word.

469
00:47:23.570 --> 00:47:30.260
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Adjusting it slightly is what I would do. I wouldn't necessarily close the room up and do a new one.

470
00:47:30.670 --> 00:47:41.580
Aleksandr Petrosyan: The things that have uh uh make perfect sense to me, and the fact that the roadmap has been there for two years. Doesn't matter that much in the grand ski of things.

471
00:47:42.120 --> 00:47:44.889
Aleksandr Petrosyan: What matters is that there is progress on it

472
00:47:49.100 --> 00:47:51.009
leading the issue open.

473
00:47:51.310 --> 00:47:52.220
Brent Zundel: Okay,

474
00:47:52.420 --> 00:47:57.130
Brent Zundel: Um. Next steps that I see the roadmap needs to be

475
00:47:57.240 --> 00:47:58.290
Brent Zundel: um

476
00:47:58.390 --> 00:48:00.510
Brent Zundel: updated and slightly adjusted.

477
00:48:02.570 --> 00:48:06.200
Brent Zundel: Is there someone willing to be assigned to that pass?

478
00:48:19.760 --> 00:48:22.240
Victor Gridnevsky: So will I be off.

479
00:48:23.020 --> 00:48:24.270
Victor Gridnevsky: So if so,

480
00:48:25.720 --> 00:48:28.959
Aleksandr Petrosyan: No, this is

481
00:48:32.590 --> 00:48:35.830
Brent Zundel: alright. You. Next is

482
00:48:36.950 --> 00:48:40.159
Brent Zundel: first of many things that we need to fix.

483
00:48:42.870 --> 00:48:46.030
Brent Zundel: Issue number one hundred and sixty seven.

484
00:48:48.230 --> 00:48:51.200
Brent Zundel: I'll just keep sharing my screen. That makes sense.

485
00:48:51.780 --> 00:48:58.049
Brent Zundel: Um! While the license file is accurate, each source file is required to start with a license banner.

486
00:48:59.990 --> 00:49:01.559
Brent Zundel: And so

487
00:49:03.860 --> 00:49:06.629
Brent Zundel: this is just one of those things that is,

488
00:49:12.610 --> 00:49:13.640
hey,

489
00:49:13.890 --> 00:49:16.370
Brent Zundel: manual task, I think, at this point,

490
00:49:20.650 --> 00:49:23.480
Brent Zundel: unless anyone knows of an automated way to.

491
00:49:26.210 --> 00:49:28.750
Victor Gridnevsky: No, I can, as i'm with python.

492
00:49:34.210 --> 00:49:36.780
Victor Gridnevsky: It's just

493
00:49:37.050 --> 00:49:40.310
Brent Zundel: as as far as I understand it.

494
00:49:41.420 --> 00:49:44.669
Brent Zundel: So, Victor, are you willing to be assigned to this one? Yes, yes,

495
00:49:47.260 --> 00:49:48.290
Victor Gridnevsky: okay.

496
00:49:49.490 --> 00:49:51.000
Victor Gridnevsky: Six hundred and one. D

497
00:49:51.540 --> 00:49:52.599
Brent Zundel: it's our one two.

498
00:49:53.930 --> 00:49:55.229
Victor Gridnevsky: Yes, yes, yes,

499
00:49:55.770 --> 00:49:56.959
Brent Zundel: excellent.

500
00:50:05.370 --> 00:50:06.339
Hmm.

501
00:50:09.330 --> 00:50:10.809
Brent Zundel: Um. So

502
00:50:10.950 --> 00:50:13.020
Brent Zundel: as far as I understand it.

503
00:50:13.140 --> 00:50:15.150
Brent Zundel: One hundred and fifty-two

504
00:50:15.630 --> 00:50:16.759
Brent Zundel: um

505
00:50:17.740 --> 00:50:21.349
Brent Zundel: is an issue that outlines a more specific

506
00:50:22.030 --> 00:50:24.890
Brent Zundel: uh step toward the roadmap,

507
00:50:25.400 --> 00:50:27.220
Brent Zundel: and proposes

508
00:50:27.240 --> 00:50:31.729
Brent Zundel: the substructures under the main or so library.

509
00:50:32.980 --> 00:50:34.089
Brent Zundel: Um,

510
00:50:37.060 --> 00:50:39.710
Brent Zundel: So it would be a top-level project.

511
00:50:43.890 --> 00:50:45.750
Brent Zundel: And this is

512
00:50:46.530 --> 00:50:53.089
Brent Zundel: this is the the conversation is Is this still makes sense as a project organizational structure

513
00:50:54.800 --> 00:50:58.040
Aleksandr Petrosyan: as a baseline? Yes, i'll be making adjustments,

514
00:51:00.040 --> 00:51:01.540
Aleksandr Petrosyan: and um

515
00:51:01.650 --> 00:51:04.529
Aleksandr Petrosyan: no English start point and

516
00:51:04.770 --> 00:51:08.530
Aleksandr Petrosyan: referencing it and saying, Why, this is different.

517
00:51:09.190 --> 00:51:11.839
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Um! He's actually good for prices as well.

518
00:51:31.500 --> 00:51:37.390
Brent Zundel: All right. So, in addition to adjusting or following, adjusting and updating the proposed structure,

519
00:51:38.310 --> 00:51:41.239
Brent Zundel: is there anything that needs to happen before

520
00:51:43.220 --> 00:51:44.779
Brent Zundel: changing the

521
00:51:44.920 --> 00:51:47.059
Brent Zundel: So here's my question.

522
00:51:47.850 --> 00:51:53.419
Brent Zundel: My understanding is that with this or with the adjusted vision,

523
00:51:53.650 --> 00:51:55.699
Brent Zundel: um as a guideline,

524
00:51:55.860 --> 00:51:58.800
Brent Zundel: as the work proceeds to

525
00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:02.589
Brent Zundel: break versa up into smaller crates.

526
00:52:03.030 --> 00:52:04.109
Brent Zundel: Um,

527
00:52:04.590 --> 00:52:09.539
Brent Zundel: This is essentially listing the crates that we want Ursa broken up into. Is that correct?

528
00:52:11.100 --> 00:52:13.000
Aleksandr Petrosyan: To an extent? Yes.

529
00:52:13.170 --> 00:52:18.360
Brent Zundel: So as that work happens, this will follow as a natural result,

530
00:52:18.460 --> 00:52:26.800
Brent Zundel: so it wouldn't make sense to just arbitrarily move a bunch of code just to get the structure we're going to get the structure eventually is that

531
00:52:27.520 --> 00:52:28.709
Brent Zundel: makes sense.

532
00:52:30.390 --> 00:52:40.320
Aleksandr Petrosyan: There's also a few less than obvious problems that might occur. Um, Ross dependency. Resolution is a strict direct to cyclic

533
00:52:40.530 --> 00:52:51.650
Aleksandr Petrosyan: meaning that you can't have cyclic dependencies right? Some things that you would have considered a single crate because of a cross-create coupling um has to be broken down into smaller chunks.

534
00:52:52.620 --> 00:53:00.050
Aleksandr Petrosyan: In most cases what you're supposed to be doing is, you are supposed to look at the coupling between functions and between features,

535
00:53:00.510 --> 00:53:03.380
Aleksandr Petrosyan: and consider splitting them off into

536
00:53:04.170 --> 00:53:08.840
Aleksandr Petrosyan: chunks that are as large as they can be without becoming completely monolithic,

537
00:53:09.360 --> 00:53:12.810
Aleksandr Petrosyan: and which will allow you to split off some functionality.

538
00:53:13.150 --> 00:53:20.840
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Let's do retain the core so normally. What this would result in is having a little bit of extra code

539
00:53:21.090 --> 00:53:22.229
Aleksandr Petrosyan: if you,

540
00:53:22.550 --> 00:53:35.280
Aleksandr Petrosyan: this might affect Debug builds, and this might give us a headache because we have a lot of dependencies and more than a static link. But if you're worried about the deploy size, this is completely relevant, because

541
00:53:35.840 --> 00:53:38.729
Aleksandr Petrosyan: any realistic deployment we have,

542
00:53:39.020 --> 00:53:42.910
Aleksandr Petrosyan: and enable to full fat, probably with translation.

543
00:53:44.340 --> 00:53:54.800
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Uh no, I think Code Jen units set to one, meaning that it's full that Lt. Over the entire library that we any kind of unused code is being killed.

544
00:53:58.010 --> 00:53:59.069
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Um!

545
00:54:00.240 --> 00:54:07.380
Aleksandr Petrosyan: That is the content that's needing adjustment. The third bit that I would recommend focusing on

546
00:54:07.520 --> 00:54:09.149
Aleksandr Petrosyan: is to

547
00:54:09.980 --> 00:54:12.299
Aleksandr Petrosyan: consider a gradual

548
00:54:12.420 --> 00:54:13.459
Aleksandr Petrosyan: split,

549
00:54:14.080 --> 00:54:16.810
Aleksandr Petrosyan: because, while I agree that

550
00:54:16.860 --> 00:54:23.839
Aleksandr Petrosyan: giving it a upgrade model is important. What is more important is reducing the feature zoom

551
00:54:24.190 --> 00:54:26.350
Aleksandr Petrosyan: to something that is more manageable.

552
00:54:27.570 --> 00:54:28.660
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Um!

553
00:54:28.750 --> 00:54:44.149
Aleksandr Petrosyan: These features have unintended consequences if they are used in a multi crate workspace. So if you have us enabled with one set of features, and we have us enabled another set of features. You didn't know how much code you being

554
00:54:44.160 --> 00:54:55.439
Aleksandr Petrosyan: you're compiling in most cases, if you don't have all here enabled, you can end up with the same library being generated four or five times in case of a So this is, uh, quite a bit of overhead. It's a hundred megabytes each,

555
00:54:55.580 --> 00:55:00.249
Aleksandr Petrosyan: and those are statically linked to the Excuse me so if you don't have Altru,

556
00:55:00.410 --> 00:55:01.979
Aleksandr Petrosyan: you can overflow any

557
00:55:02.070 --> 00:55:04.589
Aleksandr Petrosyan: any Github Ci action, or something like that.

558
00:55:05.840 --> 00:55:14.159
Aleksandr Petrosyan: So I would say. Third point would be to reduce the number of features first, and then compartmentalize it into crates.

559
00:55:22.620 --> 00:55:24.760
Brent Zundel: So would that work better as a two

560
00:55:25.030 --> 00:55:26.850
Brent Zundel: reduce the feature set,

561
00:55:27.680 --> 00:55:29.660
Aleksandr Petrosyan: perhaps as a one. Actually

562
00:55:31.580 --> 00:55:32.709
Brent Zundel: okay,

563
00:55:34.450 --> 00:55:36.609
Aleksandr Petrosyan: because it just is going to happen.

564
00:55:37.480 --> 00:55:38.660
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Naturally.

565
00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:44.930
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Um

566
00:55:46.830 --> 00:55:51.840
Aleksandr Petrosyan: release feature set. Let let's paraphrase it. Um: reduce conditional compilation.

567
00:55:54.410 --> 00:55:56.670
Brent Zundel: Yeah, that's a better way of doing anything.

568
00:56:03.980 --> 00:56:04.950
Brent Zundel: Okay,

569
00:56:11.490 --> 00:56:13.440
Brent Zundel: All right. Good. On next steps.

570
00:56:18.500 --> 00:56:20.140
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Okay, I'm:

571
00:56:21.580 --> 00:56:25.399
Brent Zundel: right as far as the sign that goes. Is this: you, Alexander?

572
00:56:26.450 --> 00:56:27.319
Yeah,

573
00:56:27.770 --> 00:56:29.080
Aleksandr Petrosyan: not your choice.

574
00:56:36.310 --> 00:56:39.549
Brent Zundel: All right. We have time for at least one more.

575
00:56:44.780 --> 00:56:46.169
Brent Zundel: Um,

576
00:56:47.140 --> 00:56:48.830
Brent Zundel: then, Middleton,

577
00:56:49.120 --> 00:56:52.040
Brent Zundel: Is it expressing concern about

578
00:56:52.410 --> 00:56:54.980
Brent Zundel: uh the bullet proofs? Module

579
00:56:55.360 --> 00:56:56.509
Brent Zundel: um

580
00:56:58.640 --> 00:56:59.859
Brent Zundel: Yes.

581
00:56:59.970 --> 00:57:02.330
Brent Zundel: Does have some problems.

582
00:57:02.570 --> 00:57:03.759
Brent Zundel: Um,

583
00:57:05.800 --> 00:57:08.839
Brent Zundel: and as far as we're aware,

584
00:57:10.210 --> 00:57:12.430
Brent Zundel: no one is currently using it.

585
00:57:14.120 --> 00:57:18.279
Brent Zundel: Um. My last suggestion, more than a year ago was

586
00:57:18.380 --> 00:57:21.320
Brent Zundel: maybe label it as experimental or

587
00:57:21.720 --> 00:57:22.649
Brent Zundel: no.

588
00:57:23.280 --> 00:57:28.250
Brent Zundel: Really introduce the idea of an experimental flag into

589
00:57:28.610 --> 00:57:34.129
Brent Zundel: um. But the real problem with bulletproofs is that it was

590
00:57:34.570 --> 00:57:36.939
Brent Zundel: rewritten here

591
00:57:37.930 --> 00:57:53.480
Brent Zundel: as a copy of code in Dallic, but is not actually linked to Dolly, and so none of the none of the updates and changes and improvements that are happening there are possible to just easily integrate here.

592
00:57:53.880 --> 00:57:54.939
Brent Zundel: Um!

593
00:57:54.990 --> 00:57:56.740
Brent Zundel: And so it's. It's

594
00:57:57.560 --> 00:58:00.839
Brent Zundel: as it exists, difficult to maintain.

595
00:58:01.800 --> 00:58:02.879
Brent Zundel: Um.

596
00:58:05.080 --> 00:58:06.490
Brent Zundel: And so this

597
00:58:07.060 --> 00:58:17.239
Brent Zundel: on the table is, Do we keep bullet proofs as a capability in Ursa? If so, how do we make sure it is done safely and properly?

598
00:58:20.340 --> 00:58:21.670
Brent Zundel: Love to hear

599
00:58:22.400 --> 00:58:24.030
Brent Zundel: comments from folks on this one.

600
00:58:26.030 --> 00:58:30.089
Aleksandr Petrosyan: What about just remaining them? As Dc. Middle, suggested

601
00:58:31.890 --> 00:58:33.549
Brent Zundel: I, totally on the table.

602
00:58:34.230 --> 00:58:35.390
Brent Zundel: Um,

603
00:58:35.930 --> 00:58:40.969
Brent Zundel: and like I said, I don't know of anybody who is using bulletproofs.

604
00:58:41.060 --> 00:58:46.399
Brent Zundel: Um! The The library that exists in our. So I know people who are using both.

605
00:58:46.960 --> 00:58:48.109
Brent Zundel: Um:

606
00:58:53.810 --> 00:58:57.859
Aleksandr Petrosyan: So my understanding of the issue is as follows:

607
00:58:57.880 --> 00:58:59.419
Aleksandr Petrosyan: This is code that is

608
00:59:00.270 --> 00:59:03.379
Aleksandr Petrosyan: basically a rewrite of a popular library,

609
00:59:03.910 --> 00:59:07.329
Aleksandr Petrosyan: except that library has been updated in our code wasn't

610
00:59:07.420 --> 00:59:16.679
Aleksandr Petrosyan: mit ctl, and so we'll be held to the same standards, and the obvious things that they have fixed, and we haven't, and then we consider the marriage to It's better to not have a feature, but to have it badly. One hundred and fifty.

611
00:59:17.460 --> 00:59:30.300
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Um! That doesn't mean that we won't have this feature. Um. One thing we could do is it could still be linked uh given that the copyright issue, and the licensing issue was remedied.

612
00:59:31.020 --> 00:59:37.960
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Um! If they weren't remedied, then it is possible that people might be able to use both if they need to,

613
00:59:41.020 --> 00:59:44.140
Aleksandr Petrosyan: but given that at some point we might,

614
00:59:44.160 --> 00:59:46.399
Aleksandr Petrosyan: wants to re-implement it.

615
00:59:46.850 --> 00:59:50.320
The only condition under which it might be a good idea. Is. If

616
00:59:50.810 --> 00:59:51.990
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Um!

617
00:59:53.400 --> 00:59:59.399
Aleksandr Petrosyan: The people who have implemented it have have a portion of time that they can dedicate to.

618
01:00:00.050 --> 01:00:01.329
Aleksandr Petrosyan: In other words,

619
01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:04.910
Aleksandr Petrosyan: it is possible that we would be able to maintain it,

620
01:00:05.470 --> 01:00:14.700
Aleksandr Petrosyan: provided that we were the original offers. And there's a good reason why it's held under a different license. In which case why is it part of us. And why isn't it a separate

621
01:00:15.480 --> 01:00:20.959
Aleksandr Petrosyan: like, if the only difference is that it is like Dominic, except it

622
01:00:21.040 --> 01:00:31.189
Aleksandr Petrosyan: has a different license. This is the whole point of open source you can create uh, an alternative which has a different license, like like with gtk and cute,

623
01:00:33.100 --> 01:00:44.900
Aleksandr Petrosyan: and you can do a license something as well. So if you need be, the best solution might be to just contact that I can ask them. Can you provide it in the a different license, so that we can use it as well.

624
01:00:47.390 --> 01:00:50.220
Aleksandr Petrosyan: It's as far as I know It's a missing license, anyway.

625
01:00:51.340 --> 01:00:53.820
Brent Zundel: Yeah, that's my understanding.

626
01:00:59.220 --> 01:01:00.580
Brent Zundel: I so

627
01:01:00.810 --> 01:01:04.759
Brent Zundel: the the primary difference between

628
01:01:05.730 --> 01:01:10.419
Brent Zundel: dialect bullet proofs and ers of bullet proofs is the underlying curve.

629
01:01:12.430 --> 01:01:13.490
Brent Zundel: Um,

630
01:01:14.750 --> 01:01:20.250
Brent Zundel: As far as I understand it, the dallic bullet proofs is built on top of riskredo, two hundred and fifty five,

631
01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:23.310
Brent Zundel: and

632
01:01:23.540 --> 01:01:29.540
Brent Zundel: the bullet proofs in Ersa, I believe, is built on thels twelve hundred and eighty-one,

633
01:01:30.560 --> 01:01:32.340
Brent Zundel: which is Why, yes,

634
01:01:32.390 --> 01:01:34.059
Brent Zundel: you know, branching

635
01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:40.049
Brent Zundel: uh for linking to the Dollar Library

636
01:01:41.010 --> 01:01:43.939
Brent Zundel: Wasn't a solution for bringing

637
01:01:44.040 --> 01:01:47.970
Brent Zundel: pull it proofs capabilities into.

638
01:01:48.270 --> 01:01:52.770
Brent Zundel: You know the space of bbs, and the other curves that are

639
01:01:52.870 --> 01:01:53.839
Brent Zundel: no

640
01:01:53.920 --> 01:01:59.570
Brent Zundel: the other sorry pbs, plus the other signatures that are built on top of bls, twelve thousand three hundred and eighty-one.

641
01:01:59.750 --> 01:02:13.479
Brent Zundel: Um! So that was the original intent was, Hey, we want bullet proofs. We want it to interact with bbs and that's, one thousand two hundred and thirty-one, so we need bullet proofs on top of twelve hundred and eighty-one um! And so Gallic was

642
01:02:13.750 --> 01:02:14.939
Brent Zundel: copied

643
01:02:16.340 --> 01:02:18.990
Brent Zundel: but with a change of the underlying curve,

644
01:02:19.300 --> 01:02:23.620
Brent Zundel: so that's just a little bit more insight into why this came up in the first place,

645
01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:28.140
Brent Zundel: to my knowledge, it's still not. Nobody's using it.

646
01:02:28.910 --> 01:02:30.049
Brent Zundel: Um!

647
01:02:30.490 --> 01:02:36.259
Brent Zundel: And it is in that nearly unmaintainable state because the original implementer

648
01:02:36.630 --> 01:02:39.560
Brent Zundel: uh leash has not been

649
01:02:39.870 --> 01:02:41.729
Brent Zundel: around for a very long time.

650
01:02:41.770 --> 01:02:42.919
Brent Zundel: Um:

651
01:02:44.140 --> 01:02:45.379
And

652
01:02:46.220 --> 01:02:47.660
Brent Zundel: yeah, yeah. So

653
01:02:48.760 --> 01:02:51.099
Brent Zundel: with with that new information.

654
01:02:51.400 --> 01:02:55.250
Brent Zundel: Uh? Do folks feel like closing it or

655
01:02:55.530 --> 01:02:59.220
Brent Zundel: removing the bullet Cruise Code is best, or

656
01:02:59.630 --> 01:03:01.129
some other tactic,

657
01:03:08.820 --> 01:03:15.359
Aleksandr Petrosyan: and they might have some use for it. Um! It might actually be a good idea to consider, also contributing

658
01:03:15.480 --> 01:03:17.740
Aleksandr Petrosyan: that different implementation to Doming,

659
01:03:19.410 --> 01:03:22.599
Aleksandr Petrosyan: so removing them from Nasa. Um.

660
01:03:22.630 --> 01:03:25.699
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Still, in my opinion is the best course of

661
01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:28.540
Aleksandr Petrosyan: um. An additional action for the

662
01:03:28.590 --> 01:03:34.020
Aleksandr Petrosyan: um benefits of the entire open source ecosystem, and for us, libraries and specifically

663
01:03:34.530 --> 01:03:39.849
Aleksandr Petrosyan: um would be to consider taking the code that we just thrown away

664
01:03:39.870 --> 01:03:43.300
Aleksandr Petrosyan: and contributing it in a form that is usable inside of Dallas.

665
01:03:45.060 --> 01:03:48.840
Aleksandr Petrosyan: It is inspired by their work, and

666
01:03:49.820 --> 01:03:52.690
Aleksandr Petrosyan: well assuming that they haven't implemented something like that.

667
01:03:53.190 --> 01:03:54.800
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Um, it might be useful.

668
01:03:54.930 --> 01:03:55.939
Um,

669
01:03:56.460 --> 01:03:58.169
Aleksandr Petrosyan: if they have

670
01:03:58.410 --> 01:04:03.269
Aleksandr Petrosyan: the thes Curve family. Of course they don't

671
01:04:04.390 --> 01:04:06.509
Aleksandr Petrosyan: might be problematic, but still

672
01:04:07.550 --> 01:04:10.900
Aleksandr Petrosyan: having that functionality, either as a separate crate

673
01:04:12.240 --> 01:04:21.040
Aleksandr Petrosyan: like us uh underscore this, and have it be hosted in the completely separate repository which has completely separate maintainers.

674
01:04:27.360 --> 01:04:29.660
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Um having it an optional

675
01:04:30.760 --> 01:04:32.560
Aleksandr Petrosyan: might be the best course in action.

676
01:04:53.840 --> 01:04:56.470
Brent Zundel: All right. Um

677
01:04:57.060 --> 01:04:58.740
Brent Zundel: it to that effect.

678
01:04:59.190 --> 01:05:00.379
Brent Zundel: Um!

679
01:05:01.860 --> 01:05:18.089
Brent Zundel: This is a bit heavier of an issue to be assigned. But is there anyone who is willing at this point to be assigned to this issue which would be first and foremost uh removing bullet proof from Ersa, and secondarily um looking into the possibility of

680
01:05:18.590 --> 01:05:23.940
Brent Zundel: cleaning that up and contributing it back to the Dalek Library.

681
01:05:32.450 --> 01:05:36.400
Aleksandr Petrosyan: I'm. Afraid i'm um at capacity at this point.

682
01:05:37.810 --> 01:05:39.779
Aleksandr Petrosyan: So

683
01:05:41.830 --> 01:05:52.009
Brent Zundel: alright, then we will leave this as it is. Um, thank you all for being here. Um, I don't we haven't had this productive in ours a meeting in a long time.

684
01:05:52.040 --> 01:05:53.109
Brent Zundel: Um!

685
01:05:54.070 --> 01:05:55.970
Brent Zundel: Uh, I will.

686
01:05:56.600 --> 01:06:04.800
Brent Zundel: I will do my best to make sure that I am here and make this meeting a priority moving forward. Um!

687
01:06:06.110 --> 01:06:09.150
Brent Zundel: So that we can continue this sort of uh

688
01:06:09.330 --> 01:06:10.859
Brent Zundel: forward progress.

689
01:06:10.980 --> 01:06:19.080
Brent Zundel: Um! I would also propose that we keep the format of the meeting roughly. The same. Begin with looking at pull requests. Um!

690
01:06:19.180 --> 01:06:25.629
Brent Zundel: See what we can merge. See what issues we can close as a result, and then continuing to triage and process issues.

691
01:06:32.050 --> 01:06:36.589
Brent Zundel: Uh, with that uh, we are at time and

692
01:06:36.790 --> 01:06:38.659
Brent Zundel: again Thank you all for being here

693
01:06:39.790 --> 01:06:41.350
Victor Gridnevsky: likewise. Thank you.

694
01:06:41.940 --> 01:06:45.110
Dmitri Venger: Thank you very much. I guess. You guys Thank you.
