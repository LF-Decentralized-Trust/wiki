00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.030
Hart Montgomery: hey cam how's it going.

2
00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.710
Cam Parra: Are you.

3
00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.880
Hart Montgomery: Not too bad.

4
00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:48.120
Cam Parra: that's good to hear.

5
00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.470
Cam Parra: How have your travels been.

6
00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.630
Hart Montgomery: i've escaped getting covered so i'm happy about that.

7
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.400
Cam Parra: We were, what was the last want me to read.

8
00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.530
Hart Montgomery: I will been to OSS na and consensus in the past month.

9
00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.930
Hart Montgomery: Both requested so.

10
00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.480
Cam Parra: that's good you know the travel for you did you stay there, the whole month basically.

11
00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.010
Hart Montgomery: No, no, I came back.

12
00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.970
Okay.

13
00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:20.280
Hart Montgomery: So.

14
00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.840
Cam Parra: that's cool did you go to RSA see.

15
00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.870
Hart Montgomery: I do not, I don't usually get RSA.

16
00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.260
Cam Parra: it's it that's more of a vendor.

17
00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:33.270
Cam Parra: conferences in it.

18
00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.800
Hart Montgomery: They have research track, but it's usually not it's not top tier.

19
00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.630
Cam Parra: Okay.

20
00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:43.800
Cam Parra: I think, was it from here was there.

21
00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.880
Cam Parra: As possible yeah I think he was there.

22
00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:51.900
Hart Montgomery: We see like giving a keynote or something.

23
00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:53.940
Cam Parra: yeah I think he was giving the keynote.

24
00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.600
Hart Montgomery: yeah and he travels a lot, he also usually goes to crypto.

25
00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.730
Cam Parra: Oh that's cool.

26
00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:02.340
Hart Montgomery: um so.

27
00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.940
Hart Montgomery: yeah.

28
00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:10.560
Hart Montgomery: I usually just.

29
00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.760
Hart Montgomery: Usually the only conference I go to I don't have to where i'm not speaking is crypto.

30
00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:23.460
Cam Parra: buddy okay cool.

31
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:30.810
Cam Parra: So they aren't speakers at crypto right it's just like small presentations and then reviews of papers.

32
00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.610
Hart Montgomery: Know it's it's talks.

33
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.610
Hart Montgomery: Okay, other have you happens beforehand pretty much.

34
00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:37.560
Cam Parra: Okay cool.

35
00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.090
Cam Parra: yeah I wanted to go to crypto this year but.

36
00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:49.740
Cam Parra: yeah we transition to the new to our new teams in kiva so.

37
00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:51.120
Hart Montgomery: What are you working on.

38
00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.030
Cam Parra: i'm working on internal api's.

39
00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:56.310
Hart Montgomery: Okay.

40
00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:03.990
Cam Parra: yeah so we so yeah I won't be working as much on on on blockchain tech so.

41
00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:06.660
Cam Parra: So yeah so.

42
00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.930
Hart Montgomery: Are you still working on cryptography a Jason stuff or.

43
00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:11.610
Cam Parra: No, not really.

44
00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:19.890
Cam Parra: So i'm doing basically ursa like still on the on on on company time but like limited.

45
00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:20.760
Hart Montgomery: gotcha.

46
00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:21.540
yeah yeah.

47
00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.510
Cam Parra: I don't know we're let's see, let me see.

48
00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:34.050
Cam Parra: If Nathan will join.

49
00:04:54.930 --> 00:05:03.570
Cam Parra: So I heard when I when I was gone on, there was a discussion or Mike presented the non credits to dotto that he's been working on.

50
00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:05.100
Hart Montgomery: uh huh.

51
00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:06.750
Cam Parra: i'm.

52
00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:09.540
Hart Montgomery: not sure if I was there for that i'd know about it, though.

53
00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:18.660
Cam Parra: Okay, I just was wondering if you had if you had if you had shared a paper or you know the math to go along with with.

54
00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:25.680
Hart Montgomery: stuff we've been so i'm not well i'm not exactly sure what he's talking about there's been a bunch of stuff.

55
00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:32.670
Hart Montgomery: yeah I would love us to move to.

56
00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:35.190
Hart Montgomery: Yes.

57
00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:41.550
Hart Montgomery: It could be talking about a number of things any, of which I think are great.

58
00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:43.170
Cam Parra: Right.

59
00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:54.480
Cam Parra: yeah I think he's talked to me about some of the some of the stuff he's been working on in that and i've reviewed some some some of the papers, he sent me and that seems fine To me it seems like a better way to do things but.

60
00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:56.880
Cam Parra: yeah I mean I would love if we could.

61
00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:01.920
Hart Montgomery: engage quite like him through coinbase.

62
00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:04.740
Hart Montgomery: i'm not sure how we do that.

63
00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:17.940
Hart Montgomery: But fundamentally right coinbase makes money through people trading right.

64
00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:25.020
Hart Montgomery: Right like they they don't make money and they're like wallet API or anything like that right.

65
00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:26.070
Cam Parra: Now yeah.

66
00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:30.750
Hart Montgomery: So, presumably it wouldn't be inconceivable for them to open source that right.

67
00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:37.440
Hart Montgomery: Like their crypto code and all that stuff.

68
00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:39.300
Cam Parra: Right.

69
00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:48.390
Hart Montgomery: That would also offer some advantages for them right because you could have like a third party put together like you could have third parties more easily use their.

70
00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:50.580
Hart Montgomery: Their system right.

71
00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:51.570
Right.

72
00:06:55.530 --> 00:07:09.330
Cam Parra: yeah yeah they would definitely be an advantage, I don't know if the plan for Mike is to release it undercoat under point base or or his independent firm that he's that he's running as well.

73
00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:10.590
Hart Montgomery: I don't know.

74
00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:13.950
Cam Parra: So that's we'll have to figure that out, but.

75
00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:30.570
Cam Parra: yeah so I guess Nathan won't be joining us, but I think like the thing that he wanted us or like you want you wanted to ask the Group was just like how we can get more code contributions and more attendance to these meetings.

76
00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:36.330
Hart Montgomery: yeah I mean that's tough, I think the hole in the ecosystem is like struggling right now.

77
00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:37.590
yeah.

78
00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:39.210
Hart Montgomery: So.

79
00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:52.800
Hart Montgomery: it's more of a large ecosystem thing, and this is sort of the hardest part right because it's hard to get people who are comfortable working with cryptographic code right.

80
00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:53.970
Right.

81
00:07:56.610 --> 00:08:03.240
Cam Parra: yeah, I guess, like, I guess, making it friendlier and having and I guess.

82
00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:17.640
Cam Parra: Having just like people will see that it that it's not so difficult that I think that would be probably like a good thing, maybe going to some meetups and talking about the code and showing like how you can easily make a contribution to it.

83
00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:20.490
Hart Montgomery: Do you want to do this.

84
00:08:23.250 --> 00:08:31.110
Cam Parra: um well, I have to have to talk with Nathan about about like what I can do this is i'm not sure what I can and cannot do.

85
00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:33.390
Cam Parra: If you want to get my meetup talk.

86
00:08:33.540 --> 00:08:34.740
Hart Montgomery: We can make that happen.

87
00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:37.860
Hart Montgomery: David boswell can really make that happen.

88
00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:43.230
Hart Montgomery: Okay, so if that's something you're interested in, we can we can.

89
00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:47.460
Hart Montgomery: I mean, I guess you probably want to do a virtual meetup right.

90
00:08:48.270 --> 00:08:50.550
Cam Parra: Right yeah I would probably be a virtual meetup and.

91
00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:53.790
Cam Parra: So kind of like it would probably be something like in DC oh did.

92
00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:57.960
Cam Parra: Over the code base, and then they like.

93
00:08:59.010 --> 00:09:03.540
Cam Parra: And then they showed how how they how they work on the code base.

94
00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:07.470
Hart Montgomery: We can definitely do that if that's what you want to do.

95
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:09.600
Cam Parra: All right.

96
00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:10.620
um.

97
00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:16.350
Cam Parra: Maybe even before that we we just talked about how how.

98
00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:20.670
Cam Parra: Basically, like or says the Foundation to a lot of these.

99
00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:30.420
Cam Parra: A lot of these code bases and if you know if if this is not work, I guess that's kind of scary we.

100
00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:32.700
Hart Montgomery: Know it's it's a good point and we've been.

101
00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:35.850
Hart Montgomery: we've been bringing this up like.

102
00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:42.030
Hart Montgomery: I guess you know.

103
00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:46.080
Hart Montgomery: that these are security bugs so please don't.

104
00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:48.270
Hart Montgomery: Please don't say anything.

105
00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:50.010
Hart Montgomery: Are we.

106
00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:52.560
Cam Parra: going to end the recording right now and.

107
00:09:52.890 --> 00:09:53.940
Hart Montgomery: uh yeah I mean.

108
00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:56.250
Cam Parra: I don't know I don't know how do you get dressed.

109
00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:57.780
Cam Parra: Is it I don't know.

110
00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.270
Cam Parra: How to grab the the host.

111
00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:03.900
Hart Montgomery: Not OK, I will.

112
00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:10.440
Hart Montgomery: Let me.

113
00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:13.770
Hart Montgomery: find it.

114
00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:23.880
Hart Montgomery: I guess, we will officially say that, like since it's just us, we will not have an official meeting today.

115
00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:25.110
Cam Parra: Right.

116
00:10:25.410 --> 00:10:29.190
Cam Parra: yeah and glad to see anyone doing next week.

117
00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:30.240
Cam Parra: or in two weeks.

118
00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:31.020
yeah.
