1
00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:59.240
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Hold up

2
00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:07.059
so.

3
00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:08.150
Bye.

4
00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:25.000
Hart Montgomery: Hey, Alexander, hey, Dmitri, how are you all today?

5
00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:29.099
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Good. Thank you.

6
00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:33.939
Dmitri Venger: Yeah. Not right now that Thank you. Should we wait a bit longer, or

7
00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:42.700
Hart Montgomery: are any of the Indie folks coming like one of the things is that I think this conflicts with the meeting that a lot of them

8
00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:48.450
Hart Montgomery: the a lot of people like Steven Kuran and others who would attend this meeting

9
00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:51.360
Hart Montgomery: have to go to.

10
00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:54.500
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Should we move it?

11
00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:59.069
Hart Montgomery: Yeah. So I Why don't I I would suggest that.

12
00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:03.589
Hart Montgomery: So I think there's some areas. It's not on the

13
00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:07.309
Hart Montgomery: calendar, but I think there's something that they usually go to.

14
00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:10.129
So it's probably good to ask

15
00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:13.440
Hart Montgomery: Steven and others if there is a conflict.

16
00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:16.990
Hart Montgomery: because i'm pretty sure there is.

17
00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:19.210
Dmitri Venger: And, Kevin.

18
00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:22.969
Hart Montgomery: how are you all doing otherwise

19
00:08:23.630 --> 00:08:25.560
Dmitri Venger: they are not bad as well. Thank you.

20
00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:27.390
Dmitri Venger: Busy, Keep it busy.

21
00:08:27.410 --> 00:08:30.780
Dmitri Venger: Yeah, it's always the case. Right? Yeah.

22
00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:34.359
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Hey, we do have some good news.

23
00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:40.859
Aleksandr Petrosyan: and I see you approved the pull request. We have one more maintainer to the list.

24
00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:44.610
Aleksandr Petrosyan: for now

25
00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:47.160
Aleksandr Petrosyan: also

26
00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:55.679
Aleksandr Petrosyan: he's an excellent developer. He's a little younger than the rest. But he's

27
00:08:56.440 --> 00:09:00.230
Aleksandr Petrosyan: great. I've given him the task of not

28
00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:02.060
interference directly.

29
00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:06.649
Aleksandr Petrosyan: So just reviewing pull requests as much as we can, so we can get it down to 0.

30
00:09:10.730 --> 00:09:14.380
Aleksandr Petrosyan: There's a a bit of a problem there in Kansas. Actually.

31
00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:20.359
Aleksandr Petrosyan: it seems like we need 3 approvals to get the dependable

32
00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:22.399
Aleksandr Petrosyan: to bump

33
00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:25.170
Aleksandr Petrosyan: single line written to your mark.

34
00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:27.850
Hart Montgomery: It should be 2 right

35
00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:29.960
Hart Montgomery: it should be you.

36
00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:32.790
Hart Montgomery: Yeah. Well, it's the proposer plus

37
00:09:36.010 --> 00:09:38.870
Hart Montgomery: different people from the proposer.

38
00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:50.099
Aleksandr Petrosyan: That's the problem. Do you have a look at actually that which Pr: you talking? What is there one?

39
00:09:50.890 --> 00:09:51.630
Hart Montgomery: Okay.

40
00:09:52.770 --> 00:09:54.060
Hart Montgomery: We would pull it up.

41
00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:59.050
Hart Montgomery: Hope Github Doesn't: ask for like 18 different authentications.

42
00:09:59.690 --> 00:10:01.220
Hart Montgomery: Okay, I see 220.

43
00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:04.899
Hart Montgomery: Okay, do you want to

44
00:10:04.990 --> 00:10:07.700
Hart Montgomery: Do you want it? So Brett has approved.

45
00:10:08.210 --> 00:10:10.160
Hart Montgomery: So you approved.

46
00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:13.040
Hart Montgomery: Do you want to ping just like Steven Current or somebody

47
00:10:13.830 --> 00:10:15.300
Hart Montgomery: who else is.

48
00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:17.029
Hart Montgomery: Let's see.

49
00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:19.759
Aleksandr Petrosyan: So there's a different one

50
00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:24.120
Aleksandr Petrosyan: right in the mobile you like. I think it's probably

51
00:10:24.250 --> 00:10:25.530
Aleksandr Petrosyan: should be the difference

52
00:10:25.990 --> 00:10:27.239
Aleksandr Petrosyan: it this way.

53
00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:30.370
Aleksandr Petrosyan: So share the screen.

54
00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:34.939
Hart Montgomery: Oh, so yeah, okay. So maybe we should also make.

55
00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:36.600
Hart Montgomery: We should

56
00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:39.370
Hart Montgomery: hunt for more maintainers.

57
00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:42.290
Aleksandr Petrosyan: I didn't think that's the problem.

58
00:10:42.510 --> 00:10:44.090
Hart Montgomery: Okay, what's the problem?

59
00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:45.780
Aleksandr Petrosyan: See

60
00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:47.850
Aleksandr Petrosyan: if you can.

61
00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:55.789
Aleksandr Petrosyan: If you can see on this the checkmark next to you on that Brand's name is Green.

62
00:10:56.220 --> 00:11:01.240
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Well, mine is great. I don't think I qualify as a

63
00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:02.889
Brent Zundel: I think I fixed that.

64
00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:04.450
Hart Montgomery: Did you ask Rye?

65
00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:08.379
Brent Zundel: I I think I fixed the problem with that one, I think.

66
00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:09.939
Hart Montgomery: Oh, Brents here, Great

67
00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:12.310
Brent Zundel: Hi! So

68
00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:14.160
Brent Zundel: when I entered

69
00:11:14.390 --> 00:11:16.890
Brent Zundel: Alexander as a maintainer.

70
00:11:18.370 --> 00:11:23.240
Brent Zundel: the the nick that I entered as his github handle was not correct.

71
00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:27.450
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Yeah.

72
00:11:27.510 --> 00:11:35.839
Brent Zundel: yeah. So when he approved the adding of another Maintainer, I went in, and it was like, oh, that green check that should be a green check, not a great check.

73
00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:39.019
Brent Zundel: and I fixed the github handle as part of that. Pr.

74
00:11:39.370 --> 00:11:42.439
Brent Zundel: And so I was hoping, moving forward. Green checks would appear.

75
00:11:44.690 --> 00:11:46.329
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Okay.

76
00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:54.269
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Actually, this call request can be just closed. The one place that makes this modification of the cargo lock which

77
00:11:54.720 --> 00:12:03.110
Aleksandr Petrosyan: you're not even supposed to commence. If you working for library, it's supposed to be only use the binary price, so

78
00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:07.530
Aleksandr Petrosyan: it's not a big deal for this one, but for the future. It might be a problem.

79
00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:12.190
Aleksandr Petrosyan: right?

80
00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:16.120
Aleksandr Petrosyan: So

81
00:12:16.170 --> 00:12:17.180
Aleksandr Petrosyan: i'll just

82
00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:19.539
Aleksandr Petrosyan: maybe give you an update on what we're doing.

83
00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:22.000
Aleksandr Petrosyan: So

84
00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:26.869
Aleksandr Petrosyan: we are looking at bumping tr

85
00:12:27.930 --> 00:12:33.749
Aleksandr Petrosyan: current optimal up to date values means latest and compatible version.

86
00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:40.779
Aleksandr Petrosyan: and then maybe a similar incompatible version. It turns out that it's a little bit complicated for also.

87
00:12:41.770 --> 00:12:44.069
Aleksandr Petrosyan: But it's architecture.

88
00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:49.780
Aleksandr Petrosyan: but we'll look into it, and we should be starting.

89
00:12:50.190 --> 00:12:51.930
Aleksandr Petrosyan: So

90
00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:54.410
Aleksandr Petrosyan: we're going to have a look at a little bit.

91
00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:59.299
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Few issues that we raise ourselves.

92
00:12:59.590 --> 00:13:00.530
Aleksandr Petrosyan: So

93
00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:04.390
Aleksandr Petrosyan: 2, 1, 3 is going to be the next one on the to do list.

94
00:13:06.090 --> 00:13:07.910
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Sure, if I can sign it myself.

95
00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:10.850
Aleksandr Petrosyan: It is a science already.

96
00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.190
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Actually, after today's amazing. I'll upstream the

97
00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:19.530
Aleksandr Petrosyan: road not full.

98
00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:26.450
Aleksandr Petrosyan: and include the issue numbers as well, so it's going to be one big issue.

99
00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:30.519
Aleksandr Petrosyan: I think that that is considered part of

100
00:13:30.610 --> 00:13:33.149
Aleksandr Petrosyan: out of hyp allergic workspace.

101
00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:42.700
Aleksandr Petrosyan: I don't know if it's a good idea. Even the low number of issues to move all of our thinking to Zen. But if it is.

102
00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:45.930
Aleksandr Petrosyan: this is an epic issue.

103
00:13:47.570 --> 00:13:50.700
Aleksandr Petrosyan: If if you prefer us to secure Github.

104
00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:56.669
Aleksandr Petrosyan: it's an issue which links to the other sub issues and try to

105
00:14:00.990 --> 00:14:02.790
Aleksandr Petrosyan: any suggestions.

106
00:14:03.150 --> 00:14:03.970
Aleksandr Petrosyan: And he's

107
00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:06.910
Okay, let's conference.

108
00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:20.710
Brent Zundel: I'm not opposed to it. I'm just not sure what that means.

109
00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:24.890
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Okay, so allow me to illustrate.

110
00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:28.109
The Zen hop is actually one of the

111
00:14:29.380 --> 00:14:30.360
Aleksandr Petrosyan: That's a.

112
00:14:34.170 --> 00:14:36.200
Aleksandr Petrosyan: They just open it quickly

113
00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:38.579
Aleksandr Petrosyan: on your screen

114
00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:42.909
Aleksandr Petrosyan: again. There we go.

115
00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:47.629
Aleksandr Petrosyan: So yeah, basically. You log in with

116
00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:49.190
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Yes, how?

117
00:14:49.370 --> 00:14:50.310
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Directly.

118
00:14:50.850 --> 00:14:52.839
Aleksandr Petrosyan: No need for separate authentication

119
00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:58.570
Aleksandr Petrosyan: because it has to work with the repositories. This is what our workspace looks like for you.

120
00:14:58.920 --> 00:14:59.560
Aleksandr Petrosyan: It's

121
00:14:59.970 --> 00:15:03.590
Aleksandr Petrosyan: so we can have some pipelines. We can have a come on board

122
00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:08.609
Aleksandr Petrosyan: with different statuses and automation, so pull request that should close.

123
00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:12.189
Aleksandr Petrosyan: supposed to be close, and not some reason

124
00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:17.590
Aleksandr Petrosyan: again this wasn't until My.

125
00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:19.340
Aleksandr Petrosyan: you get the idea.

126
00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:27.139
Aleksandr Petrosyan: This would allow us to organize things into something called

127
00:15:28.510 --> 00:15:29.510
Aleksandr Petrosyan: There we go.

128
00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:30.360
Yeah.

129
00:15:30.890 --> 00:15:36.850
Aleksandr Petrosyan: you can filter by this issue. So it shows all the issues which are assigned to that group.

130
00:15:39.490 --> 00:15:40.440
Aleksandr Petrosyan: You can

131
00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:42.719
Aleksandr Petrosyan: attached newer issues to it.

132
00:15:42.850 --> 00:15:45.079
Aleksandr Petrosyan: You can track the progress

133
00:15:45.830 --> 00:15:47.070
Aleksandr Petrosyan: assignments

134
00:15:49.310 --> 00:15:50.839
Aleksandr Petrosyan: practically anything you want.

135
00:15:52.150 --> 00:15:55.110
It's a little bit more sophisticated.

136
00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:58.789
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Github, because one that read the text that you are

137
00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:01.020
Aleksandr Petrosyan: using will be

138
00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:05.570
Aleksandr Petrosyan: whenever you are using the

139
00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:13.530
Aleksandr Petrosyan: the epic as a filter, and you have completed all of the issues which are within that epic.

140
00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:15.200
Aleksandr Petrosyan: We'll just close the

141
00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:17.490
Aleksandr Petrosyan: That's it.

142
00:16:18.270 --> 00:16:23.700
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Kind of Europe, it a lot more lightweight. And, as far as I know.

143
00:16:24.450 --> 00:16:28.480
Aleksandr Petrosyan: every project in Hyper Ledger is encouraged to use this as opposed to Jira.

144
00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:31.560
Hart Montgomery: So

145
00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:32.340
Aleksandr Petrosyan: yeah.

146
00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:34.350
Hart Montgomery: Alexander.

147
00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:37.800
Hart Montgomery: quick question. Have you looked at using Github projects?

148
00:16:38.150 --> 00:16:41.600
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Yes, we do. You don't like it

149
00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:44.310
Aleksandr Petrosyan: doesn't have the same

150
00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:47.919
Aleksandr Petrosyan: features that. And Well, actually, we

151
00:16:49.150 --> 00:16:54.010
Aleksandr Petrosyan: We've always been an issue when we're about to expire.

152
00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:55.140
Hart Montgomery: Yeah.

153
00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:58.960
Aleksandr Petrosyan: And we tried to

154
00:16:59.430 --> 00:17:01.499
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Github project. It was

155
00:17:02.050 --> 00:17:03.989
Aleksandr Petrosyan: very, very slow

156
00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:14.649
Aleksandr Petrosyan: not to mention that we duplicate all of our structure within that we can do it for, because it has a lower number of

157
00:17:14.790 --> 00:17:22.409
Aleksandr Petrosyan: from pipelines and tickets, so to speak, doesn't have the equivalent to epics. So it helps me track manually.

158
00:17:23.010 --> 00:17:25.010
Aleksandr Petrosyan: And as far as I can tell, Github

159
00:17:25.510 --> 00:17:27.429
Aleksandr Petrosyan: doesn't like automation very much.

160
00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:29.890
Aleksandr Petrosyan: So yeah.

161
00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:33.110
Hart Montgomery: So we're actually we actually went through all the tools.

162
00:17:34.390 --> 00:17:36.570
Hart Montgomery: and we have a section on Zen Hub.

163
00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:38.760
Hart Montgomery: So

164
00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:42.159
Hart Montgomery: like due to the the licensing thing.

165
00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:44.300
we're basically saying

166
00:17:44.450 --> 00:17:48.849
Hart Montgomery: projects we projects are are free to use Zen Hub if they want.

167
00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:52.670
Hart Montgomery: But we're not going to organize it at like a

168
00:17:52.730 --> 00:17:54.609
Hart Montgomery: the Hyper ledger foundation level.

169
00:17:54.930 --> 00:17:56.490
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Okay.

170
00:17:56.770 --> 00:17:57.780
Hart Montgomery: so like

171
00:17:58.390 --> 00:18:01.580
Hart Montgomery: we we do have a lot of projects to use it already.

172
00:18:03.370 --> 00:18:06.889
Hart Montgomery: and you know you are free to use it if you want.

173
00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:13.220
Hart Montgomery: So if the May. If if you all want to do it, you should. You should go for it.

174
00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:18.860
Hart Montgomery: It's not going to be like a a hyper ledger foundation wide thing.

175
00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:19.990
Okay.

176
00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:23.339
Hart Montgomery: because there is too much ambiguity over all the licensing stuff.

177
00:18:24.250 --> 00:18:27.539
Aleksandr Petrosyan: In that case, I

178
00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:31.530
Aleksandr Petrosyan: I mean it's. Again, if if you all really want to do it, you should go for it.

179
00:18:34.030 --> 00:18:34.790
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Well.

180
00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:38.410
Aleksandr Petrosyan: the reason why we

181
00:18:38.510 --> 00:18:41.200
Aleksandr Petrosyan: preferred using Zoom because we already

182
00:18:41.410 --> 00:18:45.510
Aleksandr Petrosyan: had a process around this. You don't really have anything to lose.

183
00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:47.309
Aleksandr Petrosyan: I know.

184
00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:53.510
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Let's let's just not realize it's a good idea. And besides, stuff doesn't seem to get me

185
00:18:54.380 --> 00:18:57.600
Aleksandr Petrosyan: number of issues that we do I'm not like 50,000 already.

186
00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:01.499
Hart Montgomery: And if you want I mean I

187
00:19:01.670 --> 00:19:05.670
Hart Montgomery: I don't know, like I haven't like extensively

188
00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:09.720
Hart Montgomery: dug into this stuff.

189
00:19:12.170 --> 00:19:13.290
Hart Montgomery: But i'm

190
00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:15.909
Hart Montgomery: told that

191
00:19:22.780 --> 00:19:25.989
Hart Montgomery: i'm told that Github projects is working towards

192
00:19:26.570 --> 00:19:28.999
Hart Montgomery: feature parity with stuff like Zen Hub.

193
00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:32.160
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Okay.

194
00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:35.310
Hart Montgomery: But yeah, obviously it doesn't have ethics yet.

195
00:19:36.290 --> 00:19:39.550
Aleksandr Petrosyan: All right. Make sense. In that case it's

196
00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:46.269
Hart Montgomery: you. You may want to talk to Ry about that If you're curious.

197
00:19:47.630 --> 00:19:49.420
we

198
00:19:49.510 --> 00:19:51.230
Aleksandr Petrosyan: we haven't ever to chance. Actually.

199
00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:55.210
Hart Montgomery: Okay. So yeah, bring this up with him and save it like

200
00:19:55.690 --> 00:20:00.200
Hart Montgomery: because he has a better view on the ground of this than I do.

201
00:20:01.210 --> 00:20:04.749
Hart Montgomery: So you may want to say like, hey? Right? You know

202
00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:10.820
Hart Montgomery: we're looking at. We want to use set hub, You know we heard You're encouraging people to use github projects.

203
00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:15.459
Hart Montgomery: You know. What do you think are the best ways to work around this like epic thing.

204
00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:20.860
Hart Montgomery: or what are the best way to to handle this in Github projects. I'm sure he'll have suggestions for you.

205
00:20:22.850 --> 00:20:24.990
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Okay, that's a good idea.

206
00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:26.559
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Hold it back.

207
00:20:29.850 --> 00:20:30.640
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Okay.

208
00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:32.599
Aleksandr Petrosyan: So

209
00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:35.990
Aleksandr Petrosyan: I guess we covered everything that we did

210
00:20:37.990 --> 00:20:39.850
Aleksandr Petrosyan: not a lot but

211
00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:41.730
Aleksandr Petrosyan: little people.

212
00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:55.680
Brent Zundel: I I reached out on discord about the discrepancy between the Github Orsa Maintainer's list and the Maintainer's dot Md. File that we were asked to create.

213
00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:56.820
because

214
00:20:56.900 --> 00:21:00.570
Brent Zundel: there are a lot of people who are listed as maintainers in Github, who

215
00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:03.210
Brent Zundel: haven't been around for a while.

216
00:21:03.650 --> 00:21:04.940
Brent Zundel: and so I

217
00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:13.429
Brent Zundel: I thought that the Maintainer's Md. File was supposed to be the source of truth moving forward. But it doesn't seem to be actually tied into anything

218
00:21:13.610 --> 00:21:14.410
Brent Zundel: that would

219
00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:16.720
anything. So

220
00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:18.759
Aleksandr Petrosyan: it's a painful thing.

221
00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:21.579
Hart Montgomery: Are there left over Maintainer in the project?

222
00:21:22.690 --> 00:21:26.000
Brent Zundel: There are listed in the Hyper Ledger

223
00:21:26.690 --> 00:21:29.259
Github Project.

224
00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:32.500
Brent Zundel: There are 13 people named.

225
00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:35.829
Brent Zundel: I mean, Mono drivers is still in here. We haven't seen him in

226
00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:37.550
Hart Montgomery: where

227
00:21:38.140 --> 00:21:42.570
Brent Zundel: I will drop a link for you. I don't see. I'm looking at it right now.

228
00:21:53.050 --> 00:21:53.780
Hart Montgomery: Oh.

229
00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:55.070
Hart Montgomery: yeah.

230
00:21:55.180 --> 00:22:01.589
Brent Zundel: I'm still listed as a maintainer, too right? I mean, which I mean, you're welcome to be I I

231
00:22:01.650 --> 00:22:07.630
Hart Montgomery: No, no, no, no, I'm not like. I can't have an official position

232
00:22:09.370 --> 00:22:13.989
Hart Montgomery: I had. I was told I have to. I had to resign everything.

233
00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:19.450
Hart Montgomery: So yeah, this should be updated, do you all not. I guess you all Don't, have permission for this.

234
00:22:19.670 --> 00:22:24.960
Brent Zundel: I do not have permission to make changes here.

235
00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:31.489
Brent Zundel: Okay. I reached on the Maintainer's discussion channel in discord, and we'll see what happens just now.

236
00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:32.380
Yeah.

237
00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:34.130
Hart Montgomery: Okay.

238
00:22:34.510 --> 00:22:35.270
Aleksandr Petrosyan: yeah.

239
00:22:35.890 --> 00:22:39.140
Hart Montgomery: The discord is so busy. That's a good thing, but

240
00:22:40.890 --> 00:22:42.919
Hart Montgomery: it means it's impossible to

241
00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:48.249
Hart Montgomery: to keep track of. You may also want to ask in community architects, Brent.

242
00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:49.180
Brent Zundel: Okay.

243
00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:52.200
Hart Montgomery: because I know that they'll follow that

244
00:22:56.670 --> 00:23:00.400
Hart Montgomery: they'll follow that more closely than the Maintainer discussions

245
00:23:08.710 --> 00:23:09.330
by it.

246
00:23:11.470 --> 00:23:12.100
Hey

247
00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:15.150
it?

248
00:23:15.350 --> 00:23:21.080
Hart Montgomery: And yeah, i'm gonna. I'll post the exact text we have in our like planned

249
00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:24.690
Hart Montgomery: our planned

250
00:23:26.450 --> 00:23:28.030
Hart Montgomery: project analysis.

251
00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:34.230
Hart Montgomery: This is what we're gonna say for a Zen Hub.

252
00:23:47.220 --> 00:23:47.980
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Thank you.

253
00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:54.040
Hart Montgomery: So there's gonna be a blog post soon about projected lab services.

254
00:23:54.510 --> 00:23:57.870
Hart Montgomery: because this has been very ambiguous in the past.

255
00:23:58.490 --> 00:23:59.860
Hart Montgomery: and we have a

256
00:23:59.990 --> 00:24:04.100
Hart Montgomery: a big document with the explanation of pretty much all the tools people use.

257
00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:07.860
So

258
00:24:12.930 --> 00:24:13.970
bye.

259
00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:19.200
Hart Montgomery: Yeah, I mean, Alexander, if you if you want to. Also ask about the

260
00:24:20.980 --> 00:24:23.630
Hart Montgomery: the Zen Hub versus Github Project stuff.

261
00:24:25.300 --> 00:24:28.129
Hart Montgomery: i'm sure I would get back to you at discord there as well.

262
00:24:29.690 --> 00:24:30.940
Aleksandr Petrosyan: so i'll.

263
00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:35.449
Aleksandr Petrosyan: I'll just ask him to know DM. And frankly

264
00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:45.200
Aleksandr Petrosyan: given that we would in most cases would have to create a a set of Pipelines differences. If Zen Hub Isn't encouraged to use.

265
00:24:45.430 --> 00:24:50.999
Aleksandr Petrosyan: and I did this under the assumption that I was company wide

266
00:24:51.620 --> 00:24:53.760
Aleksandr Petrosyan: in this type of legend, wide.

267
00:24:54.450 --> 00:24:57.350
Aleksandr Petrosyan: my assumption was wrong now, probably.

268
00:24:57.930 --> 00:25:01.000
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Besides.

269
00:25:01.430 --> 00:25:05.979
Aleksandr Petrosyan: that's let's get it. Sorry for her for the issues around this.

270
00:25:07.580 --> 00:25:08.550
Aleksandr Petrosyan: I was

271
00:25:09.470 --> 00:25:12.119
Aleksandr Petrosyan: It's okay, fine. We

272
00:25:12.490 --> 00:25:14.519
Aleksandr Petrosyan: I expected that to be some

273
00:25:19.850 --> 00:25:23.309
Aleksandr Petrosyan: he's in. He's a di need of contributions.

274
00:25:23.610 --> 00:25:25.770
Hart Montgomery: Yeah.

275
00:25:31.820 --> 00:25:34.199
Aleksandr Petrosyan: it's perfectly fine. This is.

276
00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:38.169
Aleksandr Petrosyan: in fact, I did have a question to Brent given that

277
00:25:38.850 --> 00:25:39.870
here. Now.

278
00:25:41.210 --> 00:25:44.450
Aleksandr Petrosyan: how should we proceed about updating all of the dependencies

279
00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:50.830
Aleksandr Petrosyan: we could make a a semantically incompatible version of.

280
00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:56.670
Aleksandr Petrosyan: because then any we exported data types would have to also be semantically compatible

281
00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:05.090
Aleksandr Petrosyan: and upgrade to the latest. Because of all the lines which are still in use. With the exceptional failure.

282
00:26:05.820 --> 00:26:06.610
Aleksandr Petrosyan: you

283
00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:11.070
Aleksandr Petrosyan: and

284
00:26:11.530 --> 00:26:13.770
Aleksandr Petrosyan: the next step would be to

285
00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:19.599
Aleksandr Petrosyan: move away from fail and to restructure the

286
00:26:21.130 --> 00:26:22.540
Aleksandr Petrosyan: maybe they as well.

287
00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:27.279
I don't want to be the only one that makes that decision.

288
00:26:27.630 --> 00:26:28.630
Aleksandr Petrosyan: So

289
00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:31.220
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Do you have any objections for me doing that?

290
00:26:31.910 --> 00:26:36.059
Brent Zundel: I I don't have any objections. I i'm.

291
00:26:36.380 --> 00:26:37.770
Brent Zundel: You know, highly

292
00:26:38.170 --> 00:26:42.820
Brent Zundel: conscious of the fact that Orsa has not even dropped a one.

293
00:26:43.150 --> 00:26:46.590
Brent Zundel: and so as much as it's, you know.

294
00:26:47.490 --> 00:26:51.409
Brent Zundel: in principle desirable to not break

295
00:26:51.890 --> 00:26:53.660
Brent Zundel: backwards. Compatibility.

296
00:26:54.150 --> 00:26:54.710
good

297
00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:56.710
Brent Zundel: folks who are using

298
00:26:56.830 --> 00:26:57.680
Brent Zundel: should

299
00:26:57.820 --> 00:27:03.310
Brent Zundel: I'm. I'm sorry it's not even a one Yet if things are different in the one than they were before

300
00:27:03.950 --> 00:27:06.739
Brent Zundel: I'm: sorry, but that's just the nature of

301
00:27:06.850 --> 00:27:07.680
Brent Zundel: okay

302
00:27:07.790 --> 00:27:10.849
Brent Zundel: young project. So

303
00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:14.840
Brent Zundel: yes, we should update the dependencies, even if that

304
00:27:15.210 --> 00:27:22.090
Brent Zundel: breaks things, because, moving forward, we need to be able to update those dependencies to things that are maintained and safe.

305
00:27:23.930 --> 00:27:25.280
Okay.

306
00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:27.820
maybe the first thing I will do.

307
00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:32.569
Aleksandr Petrosyan: I'm: okay. Already. Some time this week

308
00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:35.860
Aleksandr Petrosyan: it's

309
00:27:36.330 --> 00:27:39.770
Aleksandr Petrosyan: so from the perspective of project management.

310
00:27:40.470 --> 00:27:43.980
Aleksandr Petrosyan: There's one more question about the procedure.

311
00:27:47.550 --> 00:27:48.230
Aleksandr Petrosyan: We

312
00:27:48.460 --> 00:27:53.380
Aleksandr Petrosyan: we'll need to know when people are available for a code review, because

313
00:27:53.570 --> 00:27:55.600
Aleksandr Petrosyan: currently the people

314
00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:58.389
Aleksandr Petrosyan: from you know half of the working on us.

315
00:27:59.620 --> 00:28:01.329
Aleksandr Petrosyan: How they need to maintain this

316
00:28:02.170 --> 00:28:06.830
Aleksandr Petrosyan: I've asked other people they might volunteer. In the meantime

317
00:28:07.470 --> 00:28:14.090
Aleksandr Petrosyan: there must be some third person, so that we have proposed that, plus 2 approval from

318
00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:16.590
Aleksandr Petrosyan: of the Maintainer.

319
00:28:19.870 --> 00:28:23.580
Aleksandr Petrosyan: what would be the best time for us to

320
00:28:29.100 --> 00:28:32.919
Aleksandr Petrosyan: you know not the only 2 people who can review them. Presence?

321
00:28:34.090 --> 00:28:34.670
Yes.

322
00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:35.840
Brent Zundel: we like

323
00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:41.839
Brent Zundel: so. So Mike. Water has not obviously been coming to these meetings.

324
00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:44.349
Brent Zundel: He has

325
00:28:45.030 --> 00:28:48.370
Brent Zundel: appeared on Github within the last couple of weeks.

326
00:28:48.580 --> 00:28:52.809
Brent Zundel: responding to and approving pr's and things like that.

327
00:28:53.890 --> 00:28:59.909
Brent Zundel: like he had a couple of full requests that were open for a long time, and I ping him on them, and he went and and just closed them.

328
00:29:00.210 --> 00:29:01.800
Brent Zundel: So

329
00:29:02.020 --> 00:29:03.590
Brent Zundel: in the short term

330
00:29:03.700 --> 00:29:05.989
Brent Zundel: I think it would be possible to have

331
00:29:06.340 --> 00:29:08.730
the hope that Mike would be

332
00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:10.980
Brent Zundel: the second

333
00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:12.990
Brent Zundel: second

334
00:29:13.190 --> 00:29:16.100
Brent Zundel: party to to approve things or look at things

335
00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:19.660
Brent Zundel: as far as timing of. When the Pr's come in. I don't.

336
00:29:20.450 --> 00:29:21.780
Brent Zundel: I i'm

337
00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:25.210
Brent Zundel: try to check at least once a week

338
00:29:25.670 --> 00:29:28.360
Brent Zundel: the the list of things happening in Ersa.

339
00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:31.970
Brent Zundel: But what day of the week that actually

340
00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:33.420
Brent Zundel: false is

341
00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:35.419
Brent Zundel: is utterly variable. So

342
00:29:35.620 --> 00:29:38.050
Brent Zundel: I don't know that there's a time that

343
00:29:39.830 --> 00:29:40.900
Yeah.

344
00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:45.410
Aleksandr Petrosyan: okay.

345
00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:52.730
Aleksandr Petrosyan: i'm perspective. I don't think we have any further questions.

346
00:29:57.070 --> 00:30:02.499
Brent Zundel: So from my end I have gone in to the set of Pr's in.

347
00:30:02.550 --> 00:30:03.600
Brent Zundel: and

348
00:30:06.690 --> 00:30:07.720
Brent Zundel: essentially just.

349
00:30:08.750 --> 00:30:11.949
Brent Zundel: you know, reached out to the posters, and if no.

350
00:30:13.010 --> 00:30:17.769
Brent Zundel: you know, responses made just ended up closing all of the stale Pr's.

351
00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:22.240
Brent Zundel: So all that are left are.

352
00:30:22.580 --> 00:30:25.359
Brent Zundel: you know, the Github actions, pipeline and

353
00:30:26.050 --> 00:30:27.870
Brent Zundel: fixing was, and then

354
00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:28.550
yeah

355
00:30:28.940 --> 00:30:31.890
Brent Zundel: bumping the depend upon thing which I I think is

356
00:30:32.180 --> 00:30:34.750
Brent Zundel: going to be a non-issue. Once you get your Pr. In.

357
00:30:37.330 --> 00:30:38.939
Brent Zundel: just want to

358
00:30:39.060 --> 00:30:41.929
Brent Zundel: what folks know that I had been doing that.

359
00:30:46.010 --> 00:30:47.979
Brent Zundel: and really look forward to

360
00:30:48.250 --> 00:30:49.760
Brent Zundel: a little bit more active

361
00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:52.470
Brent Zundel: progress, moving forward

362
00:30:56.810 --> 00:30:57.920
Aleksandr Petrosyan: feelings meet you

363
00:31:03.230 --> 00:31:09.429
Brent Zundel: So having done that with the Pr. I think the only open prs are ones that we care about, or.

364
00:31:09.670 --> 00:31:14.130
Brent Zundel: you know, ultimately won't. But for the meantime it doesn't hurt to leave it open.

365
00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:15.580
Brent Zundel: I

366
00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:20.600
Brent Zundel: if other folks are okay with it. I'd like to.

367
00:31:20.750 --> 00:31:22.349
Brent Zundel: I'd like to go through

368
00:31:22.370 --> 00:31:24.839
Brent Zundel: and start doing some issue triage.

369
00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:31.040
Brent Zundel: See which one of which which of these we feel are still

370
00:31:31.090 --> 00:31:34.110
Brent Zundel: pertinent. I mean, there's issues that go all the way back to

371
00:31:34.770 --> 00:31:36.020
Brent Zundel: 2020. So

372
00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:39.609
Aleksandr Petrosyan: the point question is

373
00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:42.389
Brent Zundel: as we go through, the the first question will be.

374
00:31:42.680 --> 00:31:44.010
Brent Zundel: Is this pertinent?

375
00:31:44.220 --> 00:31:46.630
The second one? If yes.

376
00:31:46.980 --> 00:31:51.570
Brent Zundel: do we want to address it for version one or a future version

377
00:31:53.590 --> 00:31:54.520
Aleksandr Petrosyan: that's correct.

378
00:31:54.750 --> 00:31:56.809
Brent Zundel: Folks don't mind that.

379
00:31:58.330 --> 00:31:59.410
Brent Zundel: I'll just start

380
00:32:00.020 --> 00:32:02.640
Brent Zundel: walking through issues. I'll share my screen.

381
00:32:07.380 --> 00:32:10.949
Hart Montgomery: Brent. I'm: unfortunately gonna have to drop for another meeting.

382
00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:13.710
Hart Montgomery: Thank you all.

383
00:32:13.730 --> 00:32:19.460
Hart Montgomery: Okay, yeah, Alexander, please feel free to reach out to staff on all of this stuff. Please don't.

384
00:32:19.550 --> 00:32:20.699
Hart Montgomery: Please don't be shy.

385
00:32:21.030 --> 00:32:22.390
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Yeah, No problem.

386
00:32:23.670 --> 00:32:28.920
Hart Montgomery: Alright. Thank you all very much, and I will talk to you later. Please let me know if you, If there's anything I can do to help.

387
00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:30.370
Brent Zundel: Thanks for.

388
00:32:30.450 --> 00:32:32.540
Hart Montgomery: Thank you. And

389
00:32:32.690 --> 00:32:34.950
Hart Montgomery: one other thing before I drop

390
00:32:35.060 --> 00:32:39.349
Hart Montgomery: I'm going to keep an eye on the open wallet community as well.

391
00:32:39.460 --> 00:32:44.659
Hart Montgomery: and if they have people looking to do similar stuff. I will obviously put you all in touch.

392
00:32:45.340 --> 00:32:46.220
Brent Zundel: Excellent.

393
00:32:47.100 --> 00:32:50.249
Hart Montgomery: so awesome. Thank you all so much. I'll talk to you later.

394
00:32:50.690 --> 00:32:51.610
Brent Zundel: Thank you. Hart.

395
00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:58.519
Brent Zundel: All right. We'll we'll start by looking at issue. 177

396
00:32:58.630 --> 00:33:03.230
instructions on how to include and use Z. Mix are outdated

397
00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:05.410
Brent Zundel: could be confusing

398
00:33:05.930 --> 00:33:07.250
Brent Zundel: should be updated.

399
00:33:09.590 --> 00:33:18.259
Brent Zundel: I think that this is not quite stale, but as soon as we begin making the structural changes that have been discussed it will be

400
00:33:18.700 --> 00:33:19.950
Brent Zundel: entirely stale.

401
00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:22.090
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Umhm.

402
00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:23.910
Brent Zundel: And so

403
00:33:24.970 --> 00:33:26.670
Brent Zundel: we have the option of

404
00:33:27.430 --> 00:33:29.880
Brent Zundel: indicating now that we don't expect

405
00:33:30.390 --> 00:33:34.790
Brent Zundel: this will be an issue in the future without addressing it, or we could

406
00:33:35.030 --> 00:33:40.630
Brent Zundel: but, like we could leave it open and say, we'll close this as soon as it's. Officially. No longer an issue, or we could right now say

407
00:33:41.990 --> 00:33:44.249
Brent Zundel: we have a different plan moving forward.

408
00:33:46.510 --> 00:33:47.430
Brent Zundel: closing

409
00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:55.060
Aleksandr Petrosyan: my recommendation would be to leave it open and close it when we definitely know that it's not going to be the issue. I agree.

410
00:33:57.620 --> 00:34:02.990
Brent Zundel: so it's not going to go under of these 2 V. One milestone. But we could

411
00:34:03.910 --> 00:34:11.659
Brent Zundel: any recommendations for a label that we could use to indicate we don't expect this to be something we care about in the future.

412
00:34:12.150 --> 00:34:14.259
Possibly irrelevant.

413
00:34:23.719 --> 00:34:24.560
Yeah.

414
00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:27.759
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Good choice of color

415
00:34:27.810 --> 00:34:32.440
Brent Zundel: I was I I it was a little too ugly for me. I was like, let's let's get something going on

416
00:34:35.989 --> 00:34:38.509
Brent Zundel: alright, i'm going to this one.

417
00:34:40.739 --> 00:34:42.080
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Cool

418
00:34:46.179 --> 00:34:47.069
Aleksandr Petrosyan: to that.

419
00:34:47.639 --> 00:34:49.080
Aleksandr Petrosyan: That that something

420
00:34:50.380 --> 00:34:51.599
yeah.

421
00:34:52.250 --> 00:34:53.569
that you all

422
00:34:58.620 --> 00:34:59.229
Aleksandr Petrosyan: yeah.

423
00:35:00.010 --> 00:35:01.129
Brent Zundel: right

424
00:35:02.060 --> 00:35:10.869
Brent Zundel: next one. This is. This is the big one operation. Oh, so this was the original plan for the Ersa refactor.

425
00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:14.729
Brent Zundel: It's

426
00:35:15.430 --> 00:35:19.680
Brent Zundel: not entirely out of line with the direction

427
00:35:20.250 --> 00:35:25.529
Brent Zundel: we seem to currently be going in. But I think the details are

428
00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:27.629
Brent Zundel: probably

429
00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:30.619
Brent Zundel: a bit different.

430
00:35:31.090 --> 00:35:35.480
Brent Zundel: The question is, would it be worthwhile.

431
00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:38.119
Would it be worthwhile

432
00:35:38.670 --> 00:35:48.350
Brent Zundel: on this ticket, creating a new list of things that we want to do, or creating another issue with that list of things that we intend to do.

433
00:35:49.940 --> 00:35:50.910
Brent Zundel: and then

434
00:35:50.930 --> 00:35:51.930
Brent Zundel: I, using this one.

435
00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:53.230
What's that issue

436
00:35:53.780 --> 00:35:55.069
is opened?

437
00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:57.250
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Okay.

438
00:35:57.390 --> 00:35:58.379
Aleksandr Petrosyan: So

439
00:35:58.610 --> 00:36:00.720
Aleksandr Petrosyan: my perspective on this would be

440
00:36:01.340 --> 00:36:02.200
Aleksandr Petrosyan: you do?

441
00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:04.600
Aleksandr Petrosyan: We should indicate that we are.

442
00:36:04.710 --> 00:36:10.380
Aleksandr Petrosyan: But there is a possible conflict. But I do think that what we are trying to do is a very different thing; that

443
00:36:11.790 --> 00:36:14.089
Aleksandr Petrosyan: to operation also, basically

444
00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:20.100
Aleksandr Petrosyan: any reason being the whole idea here is that we should bring it as

445
00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:27.099
Aleksandr Petrosyan: as a cryptographic library to be more feature complete, and the structural edits are

446
00:36:27.700 --> 00:36:29.370
Aleksandr Petrosyan: mainly to reduce the

447
00:36:31.650 --> 00:36:35.480
Aleksandr Petrosyan: technical debt. What we are trying to do is actually

448
00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:38.190
Aleksandr Petrosyan: mainly reduce the technical debt.

449
00:36:38.690 --> 00:36:40.270
Aleksandr Petrosyan: and then to bring it

450
00:36:40.290 --> 00:36:41.489
Aleksandr Petrosyan: in line with

451
00:36:42.380 --> 00:36:43.519
Aleksandr Petrosyan: what the vision might

452
00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:52.479
Aleksandr Petrosyan: from our perspective us is complete. We have everything we need, so separating them into issues.

453
00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:56.930
Aleksandr Petrosyan: i'm. Closing this one when the other 2 are close makes sense.

454
00:36:58.280 --> 00:37:05.930
Aleksandr Petrosyan: We will not address operation also. We would try to avoid conflicts wherever possible. If there are conflicts, we would just indicate it here.

455
00:37:06.770 --> 00:37:10.029
Aleksandr Petrosyan: and they look forward to questions. And it's the code.

456
00:37:15.170 --> 00:37:15.790
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Yeah.

457
00:37:17.080 --> 00:37:20.010
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Oh, i'm best to put it honestly.

458
00:37:21.810 --> 00:37:22.430
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Yeah.

459
00:37:32.340 --> 00:37:32.979
bye.

460
00:37:38.870 --> 00:37:39.540
Yeah.

461
00:37:41.950 --> 00:37:42.700
Aleksandr Petrosyan: sure.

462
00:37:44.390 --> 00:37:45.200
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Yeah.

463
00:38:03.510 --> 00:38:04.129
Okay.

464
00:38:06.290 --> 00:38:09.230
Brent Zundel: Also going to label it with possibly irrelevant.

465
00:38:29.080 --> 00:38:29.990
Brent Zundel: Hey?

466
00:38:30.940 --> 00:38:31.500
Yeah.

467
00:38:34.080 --> 00:38:39.939
Brent Zundel: 181 more flexible 0 knowledge attribute equality in non credits.

468
00:38:42.640 --> 00:38:43.279
Yeah.

469
00:38:46.930 --> 00:38:55.579
Aleksandr Petrosyan: it's like you can prove that I think it's to the user would still be able to add another

470
00:38:58.800 --> 00:39:00.590
Aleksandr Petrosyan: with the same link secrets.

471
00:39:03.810 --> 00:39:06.339
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Okay.

472
00:39:06.420 --> 00:39:07.729
Aleksandr Petrosyan: So they

473
00:39:07.810 --> 00:39:10.009
Aleksandr Petrosyan: link to specific implementations.

474
00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:13.209
Aleksandr Petrosyan: I have to imagine that

475
00:39:13.530 --> 00:39:18.499
Aleksandr Petrosyan: this should still be relevant. It's enhancement, because

476
00:39:19.010 --> 00:39:20.500
Aleksandr Petrosyan: so this is just

477
00:39:20.980 --> 00:39:22.640
Aleksandr Petrosyan: changing the functionality.

478
00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:26.370
Aleksandr Petrosyan: So.

479
00:39:26.420 --> 00:39:28.149
Aleksandr Petrosyan: yes, to the first question.

480
00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:30.460
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Second question.

481
00:39:31.700 --> 00:39:36.720
Aleksandr Petrosyan: I think it makes sense for one, though, because this is a convenient feature that people would accept.

482
00:39:39.060 --> 00:39:46.069
Aleksandr Petrosyan: At the very least it would make our life when we actually implement zoom knowledge proofs a little bit easier.

483
00:39:48.030 --> 00:39:48.620
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Yeah.

484
00:39:50.700 --> 00:39:52.339
I agreed.

485
00:39:54.260 --> 00:39:57.360
Brent Zundel: All right, labeled as enhancement added to

486
00:39:57.390 --> 00:39:59.989
Brent Zundel: Milestone V: One.

487
00:40:03.350 --> 00:40:04.279
Thank you.

488
00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:18.350
Aleksandr Petrosyan: It's an implements to the era that prevents us from comfortable.

489
00:40:19.610 --> 00:40:21.029
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Okay.

490
00:40:21.250 --> 00:40:22.220
Aleksandr Petrosyan: there's

491
00:40:22.930 --> 00:40:24.840
Aleksandr Petrosyan: one potential caveat to this issue

492
00:40:25.110 --> 00:40:27.490
Implementing some error error

493
00:40:28.470 --> 00:40:33.599
Aleksandr Petrosyan: requires to implement an orthogonal feature set which is called standard

494
00:40:34.020 --> 00:40:36.049
Aleksandr Petrosyan: dependence on Standard Library, because

495
00:40:36.070 --> 00:40:37.899
Aleksandr Petrosyan: our era is

496
00:40:38.100 --> 00:40:42.160
Aleksandr Petrosyan: sd compliant. If you're running it in an embedded context.

497
00:40:42.300 --> 00:40:43.390
Aleksandr Petrosyan: which we do.

498
00:40:43.900 --> 00:40:45.359
Aleksandr Petrosyan: it will break everything.

499
00:40:46.810 --> 00:40:48.020
Aleksandr Petrosyan: But, on the other hand.

500
00:40:48.730 --> 00:40:56.289
Aleksandr Petrosyan: has a point here, but most libraries assume that you are using the standard library error in space.

501
00:40:56.870 --> 00:41:00.009
Aleksandr Petrosyan: and unfortunately given that this interface is not portable.

502
00:41:00.300 --> 00:41:04.509
It cannot be moved into another library, but is imported separately.

503
00:41:06.190 --> 00:41:07.399
Aleksandr Petrosyan: So

504
00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:09.249
Aleksandr Petrosyan: this is very much

505
00:41:09.580 --> 00:41:12.570
Aleksandr Petrosyan: gonna have to happen after we've done that we

506
00:41:12.760 --> 00:41:14.949
Aleksandr Petrosyan: into smaller crates.

507
00:41:15.930 --> 00:41:16.899
Aleksandr Petrosyan: because.

508
00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:22.930
Aleksandr Petrosyan: adding another feature to an already ludicrous amount of features is going to be problematic.

509
00:41:27.630 --> 00:41:28.450
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Thanks.

510
00:41:28.860 --> 00:41:33.230
Aleksandr Petrosyan: This might become a little bit easier with, anyhow, because

511
00:41:34.060 --> 00:41:36.959
Aleksandr Petrosyan: I think they have the facilities time for the next release.

512
00:41:37.060 --> 00:41:45.480
Aleksandr Petrosyan: if it's not already. But it will detect standard, no standard environments, and accordingly derive the correct

513
00:41:46.120 --> 00:41:48.060
Aleksandr Petrosyan: right?

514
00:42:09.660 --> 00:42:13.540
Brent Zundel: Okay. So I do think that we need to.

515
00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:14.299
Brent Zundel: I mean.

516
00:42:14.450 --> 00:42:16.679
Brent Zundel: I see this as

517
00:42:19.350 --> 00:42:22.049
Brent Zundel: I'm: i'm going to rename the issue as

518
00:42:23.430 --> 00:42:25.530
Brent Zundel: fix versa error handling.

519
00:42:27.580 --> 00:42:32.059
Brent Zundel: and we can use it to just track that aspect of

520
00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:32.970
Brent Zundel: of

521
00:42:34.450 --> 00:42:40.520
Aleksandr Petrosyan: to general. You know we'll be a very specific fix er as a, because then

522
00:42:40.740 --> 00:42:42.359
Aleksandr Petrosyan: we will deprecate the failure

523
00:42:42.730 --> 00:42:43.529
Aleksandr Petrosyan: library.

524
00:42:43.650 --> 00:42:45.390
Aleksandr Petrosyan: and instead use Anyhow.

525
00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:50.969
Aleksandr Petrosyan: in addition to that, there will also be a few minor tweets to how errors are being exported.

526
00:42:51.080 --> 00:42:58.489
Aleksandr Petrosyan: namely, that we want them to be re-exorted, so that you don't actually need to import the library from which the era came in order to be able to process it.

527
00:42:59.130 --> 00:43:02.880
Aleksandr Petrosyan: And even then, because for us using nominated typing is not always possible.

528
00:43:02.900 --> 00:43:03.549
So

529
00:43:05.170 --> 00:43:08.689
Aleksandr Petrosyan: there's a lot more to fixing

530
00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:12.819
it.

531
00:43:12.840 --> 00:43:15.869
Aleksandr Petrosyan: That would be a good thing for an epic, and adding this issue to that, I think

532
00:43:24.870 --> 00:43:35.429
Aleksandr Petrosyan: this is also definitely an enhancement and definitely something that needs to be done for 1 point out, because, said era era is a common assumption, like all libraries.

533
00:43:35.960 --> 00:43:39.289
Aleksandr Petrosyan: so it cannot be considered. Feature completed. It Doesn't actually have that

534
00:43:47.710 --> 00:43:48.370
Aleksandr Petrosyan: alright.

535
00:43:54.840 --> 00:43:58.580
Brent Zundel: subtract for core components.

536
00:43:59.220 --> 00:44:01.990
Brent Zundel: keys, macros, big number errors.

537
00:44:04.660 --> 00:44:06.779
Brent Zundel: This is a a sub

538
00:44:08.020 --> 00:44:11.539
Brent Zundel: issue to the project Orsa issue

539
00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:14.419
Brent Zundel: not sure.

540
00:44:15.700 --> 00:44:21.910
Aleksandr Petrosyan: I'd say that it's one of the mechanisms on which we will achieve the we fact that we want

541
00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:29.830
Aleksandr Petrosyan: to be clear. There are alternatives to this.

542
00:44:29.870 --> 00:44:34.010
Aleksandr Petrosyan: but this seems to be the least painful method, because then you.

543
00:44:34.690 --> 00:44:40.899
Aleksandr Petrosyan: if you were using this project, you would have to do it. You would import as a call.

544
00:44:41.490 --> 00:44:47.540
Aleksandr Petrosyan: and then you would statically link whatever algorithms you wanted a separate crates.

545
00:44:47.700 --> 00:44:50.350
Aleksandr Petrosyan: it could be painful, but it would be quick.

546
00:44:50.470 --> 00:44:56.190
Aleksandr Petrosyan: and with Lto. It would also be efficient, because then you would have one instance of

547
00:44:56.360 --> 00:44:59.269
Aleksandr Petrosyan: as a call, and everything else will just

548
00:44:59.290 --> 00:45:01.070
Aleksandr Petrosyan: statically look to that

549
00:45:01.330 --> 00:45:02.899
Aleksandr Petrosyan: and produce a single

550
00:45:02.920 --> 00:45:03.649
Aleksandr Petrosyan: great

551
00:45:03.910 --> 00:45:04.860
Aleksandr Petrosyan: that makes sense.

552
00:45:06.230 --> 00:45:07.929
Aleksandr Petrosyan: We can kind of simulate them.

553
00:45:08.100 --> 00:45:12.180
Aleksandr Petrosyan: but it does tend to produce

554
00:45:12.230 --> 00:45:14.580
Aleksandr Petrosyan: multiple, useless build.

555
00:45:14.890 --> 00:45:17.089
Aleksandr Petrosyan: It's not quite there yet.

556
00:45:19.960 --> 00:45:23.690
Brent Zundel: so leave the label enhancement, add it to milestone. V. One

557
00:45:24.190 --> 00:45:25.470
Aleksandr Petrosyan: I

558
00:45:25.580 --> 00:45:26.730
Aleksandr Petrosyan: I don't know.

559
00:45:26.850 --> 00:45:31.439
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Did you consider the refactoring to be necessary for one month.

560
00:45:33.880 --> 00:45:35.620
Aleksandr Petrosyan: or should it be, too, by now?

561
00:45:38.310 --> 00:45:39.029
Okay.

562
00:45:39.280 --> 00:45:40.450
Aleksandr Petrosyan: maybe it's

563
00:45:45.110 --> 00:45:46.600
Aleksandr Petrosyan: to be fine.

564
00:45:46.930 --> 00:45:49.650
Aleksandr Petrosyan: 1 point. So how do we find what it is?

565
00:45:51.300 --> 00:45:55.509
Aleksandr Petrosyan: It means that as a is in a relatively stable state, right?

566
00:45:56.170 --> 00:45:56.759
Yeah.

567
00:45:58.020 --> 00:46:00.410
Aleksandr Petrosyan: In that case, at the label Monthly. So

568
00:46:08.730 --> 00:46:09.580
Aleksandr Petrosyan: okay.

569
00:46:17.620 --> 00:46:22.410
Brent Zundel: I use proof

570
00:46:26.650 --> 00:46:27.740
Brent Zundel: perfect.

571
00:46:32.210 --> 00:46:33.650
Aleksandr Petrosyan: They both question

572
00:46:35.420 --> 00:46:38.819
Aleksandr Petrosyan: and possibly relevant. This will change.

573
00:46:41.500 --> 00:46:42.439
Aleksandr Petrosyan: This would be

574
00:46:42.580 --> 00:46:52.619
Aleksandr Petrosyan: useful for the old architecture. But in the New York session. I don't think that the same structure will make the function will be the relatively the same. But the calling conventions for them.

575
00:46:52.760 --> 00:46:55.089
Aleksandr Petrosyan: i. E. Are they

576
00:46:55.530 --> 00:46:57.679
associated functions as a type.

577
00:46:57.810 --> 00:46:59.060
Aleksandr Petrosyan: they will change.

578
00:47:03.180 --> 00:47:04.600
Brent Zundel: Okay.

579
00:47:08.820 --> 00:47:09.450
Okay.

580
00:47:13.560 --> 00:47:15.679
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Okay, that's an important point.

581
00:47:20.260 --> 00:47:22.549
So we encountered this issue as well.

582
00:47:23.980 --> 00:47:27.640
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Basically we have a cannot be compiled into what assembly?

583
00:47:28.150 --> 00:47:29.009
Aleksandr Petrosyan: How this

584
00:47:30.210 --> 00:47:40.540
Aleksandr Petrosyan: and this is an important problem, because it prevents us from using with us directly inside of our javascript, SDK. And it said, we use, you know how, which itself can also assembly.

585
00:47:41.100 --> 00:47:48.479
Aleksandr Petrosyan: and somehow avoid the how. We we know exactly what needs to be done to look around in this case.

586
00:47:49.660 --> 00:47:50.520
Aleksandr Petrosyan: which

587
00:47:51.300 --> 00:47:54.010
Aleksandr Petrosyan: I say, but this is definitely.

588
00:47:55.280 --> 00:47:56.690
Aleksandr Petrosyan: I label it as a bug.

589
00:47:57.380 --> 00:48:03.089
Aleksandr Petrosyan: I'd give it the milestone. With 1 point I might give it a higher priority or less the issues

590
00:48:03.850 --> 00:48:10.359
Aleksandr Petrosyan: because, not being able to compound some web assembly defeats a lot of your use. Cases for rust

591
00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:20.060
Brent Zundel: sounds good to me.

592
00:48:29.240 --> 00:48:33.500
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Yeah, this is out of the fix.

593
00:48:38.290 --> 00:48:43.699
Aleksandr Petrosyan: The reason why we needed this is because on us it doesn't actually

594
00:48:44.410 --> 00:48:48.180
Aleksandr Petrosyan: so. What I would do is, I would create another issue

595
00:48:49.090 --> 00:48:54.170
Aleksandr Petrosyan: which actually specifies that all.

596
00:48:54.970 --> 00:48:57.000
Aleksandr Petrosyan: So then, you don't have to

597
00:48:58.400 --> 00:49:01.660
Aleksandr Petrosyan: guess which library a particular era came from.

598
00:49:02.550 --> 00:49:04.420
Aleksandr Petrosyan: and you can just directly process.

599
00:49:05.850 --> 00:49:12.280
Aleksandr Petrosyan: The reason why we came across this issue was because in that specific case

600
00:49:13.610 --> 00:49:17.049
Aleksandr Petrosyan: the error was returned, but it was a private structure.

601
00:49:17.810 --> 00:49:21.180
Aleksandr Petrosyan: So we saw that what was return was a

602
00:49:22.560 --> 00:49:23.810
Aleksandr Petrosyan: was an era

603
00:49:24.010 --> 00:49:29.830
Aleksandr Petrosyan: because it was in the right position in the email, but it never implemented in any

604
00:49:29.900 --> 00:49:33.240
Aleksandr Petrosyan: didn't er or any of the standard trace for that.

605
00:49:33.820 --> 00:49:41.939
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Nor was it possible to process it. The only way you could deal with it was to print it and pass the

606
00:49:42.150 --> 00:49:42.950
Aleksandr Petrosyan: horrible.

607
00:49:48.320 --> 00:49:49.959
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Could you assign this to me?

608
00:49:51.020 --> 00:49:52.379
Aleksandr Petrosyan: And just

609
00:49:53.040 --> 00:49:53.740
okay.

610
00:49:54.220 --> 00:49:56.640
Aleksandr Petrosyan: I will just remember what I need to do about this

611
00:49:59.500 --> 00:50:00.270
Brent Zundel: sounds good.

612
00:50:01.600 --> 00:50:04.650
Brent Zundel: Any labels or milestones that would aid in

613
00:50:06.010 --> 00:50:07.720
Brent Zundel: in that

614
00:50:08.340 --> 00:50:09.729
Aleksandr Petrosyan: possibly relevant.

615
00:50:09.880 --> 00:50:15.030
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Because it will definitely be

616
00:50:24.070 --> 00:50:29.209
Brent Zundel: It's like similarly

617
00:50:29.230 --> 00:50:31.450
assign it to me.

618
00:50:31.880 --> 00:50:34.050
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Give it.

619
00:50:34.430 --> 00:50:36.709
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Oh.

620
00:50:43.340 --> 00:50:43.939
okay.

621
00:50:58.520 --> 00:50:59.430
Aleksandr Petrosyan: okay.

622
00:51:04.170 --> 00:51:04.810
okay.

623
00:51:07.490 --> 00:51:08.229
Aleksandr Petrosyan: that's

624
00:51:10.120 --> 00:51:11.990
Aleksandr Petrosyan: why is it locked down?

625
00:51:15.730 --> 00:51:16.509
Oh.

626
00:51:21.340 --> 00:51:22.250
don't you us?

627
00:51:34.720 --> 00:51:38.160
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Okay. So from my perspective, this

628
00:51:38.500 --> 00:51:40.709
Aleksandr Petrosyan: he's about, and it's

629
00:51:46.990 --> 00:51:48.109
Aleksandr Petrosyan: okay

630
00:51:56.820 --> 00:51:57.450
or

631
00:51:57.590 --> 00:52:00.449
Brent Zundel: versa should have a key validation protocol

632
00:52:03.260 --> 00:52:12.390
Aleksandr Petrosyan: check. If the signature is valid by signing an unknown object to sign that this should be added to key principles, but should remain optional. If you need more of this implementation.

633
00:52:14.720 --> 00:52:15.310
Okay.

634
00:52:15.440 --> 00:52:17.890
Aleksandr Petrosyan: I agree that it should be made optional.

635
00:52:18.590 --> 00:52:21.620
Aleksandr Petrosyan: But I can't think of a mechanism

636
00:52:22.340 --> 00:52:23.550
Aleksandr Petrosyan: if it is not, for

637
00:52:26.050 --> 00:52:29.150
Aleksandr Petrosyan: I give it a label of enhancement, and I give it a

638
00:52:29.940 --> 00:52:32.559
Aleksandr Petrosyan: the most of 1.1, maybe 1.2,

639
00:52:34.240 --> 00:52:34.810
Aleksandr Petrosyan: one.

640
00:52:35.300 --> 00:52:37.980
Brent Zundel: Should we? At this stage

641
00:52:38.810 --> 00:52:39.990
Aleksandr Petrosyan: you can think about

642
00:52:40.330 --> 00:52:43.819
Brent Zundel: I I I would. I would rather set up a future milestone.

643
00:52:44.120 --> 00:52:44.770
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Yeah.

644
00:52:46.570 --> 00:52:47.640
Aleksandr Petrosyan: makes sense.

645
00:52:48.490 --> 00:52:49.500
Brent Zundel: and we can

646
00:52:49.780 --> 00:52:51.980
Brent Zundel: further triage as we get

647
00:52:54.940 --> 00:52:55.649
Aleksandr Petrosyan: good point.

648
00:53:02.170 --> 00:53:03.729
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Yeah, this is my issue

649
00:53:06.980 --> 00:53:08.980
Aleksandr Petrosyan: it to me

650
00:53:11.270 --> 00:53:14.509
Aleksandr Petrosyan: and give it a security level.

651
00:53:19.230 --> 00:53:20.350
Yeah.

652
00:53:24.830 --> 00:53:26.529
give it Sf.

653
00:53:30.140 --> 00:53:31.820
Aleksandr Petrosyan: one of the primary reds.

654
00:53:34.040 --> 00:53:34.640
Brent Zundel: Yeah.

655
00:53:34.860 --> 00:53:35.419
yeah.

656
00:53:38.620 --> 00:53:40.929
Aleksandr Petrosyan: it's a nice little, but that's kind of a point.

657
00:53:43.790 --> 00:53:44.390
Yeah.

658
00:53:44.980 --> 00:53:46.759
Brent Zundel: And

659
00:53:46.900 --> 00:53:47.669
Brent Zundel: I mean

660
00:53:48.960 --> 00:53:50.790
because

661
00:53:57.230 --> 00:53:59.279
Aleksandr Petrosyan: it's it's it's it's maintained

662
00:54:00.800 --> 00:54:01.589
Aleksandr Petrosyan: same thing.

663
00:54:18.990 --> 00:54:19.849
Brent Zundel: I think there

664
00:54:21.040 --> 00:54:22.319
Aleksandr Petrosyan: yeah, exactly.

665
00:54:26.060 --> 00:54:26.919
Aleksandr Petrosyan: this is

666
00:54:27.360 --> 00:54:30.629
Aleksandr Petrosyan: kind of more of a future thing, because

667
00:54:30.930 --> 00:54:33.169
Aleksandr Petrosyan: what we could do is we could just use

668
00:54:33.380 --> 00:54:38.220
Aleksandr Petrosyan: a Yes, soft for the time being. It's fairly quick, and

669
00:54:38.600 --> 00:54:42.739
Aleksandr Petrosyan: in this case the Ni Doesn't really give you much of an advantage.

670
00:54:46.990 --> 00:54:47.700
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Yeah.

671
00:54:49.370 --> 00:54:50.500
Yeah.

672
00:54:53.420 --> 00:54:54.250
Aleksandr Petrosyan: yes.

673
00:54:55.110 --> 00:54:57.190
Aleksandr Petrosyan: This is a C.

674
00:54:57.800 --> 00:54:58.359
Okay.

675
00:54:59.270 --> 00:55:04.730
Aleksandr Petrosyan: whether you're trying to use this inside of the build system. You need the library to be compiled in a

676
00:55:05.760 --> 00:55:09.000
Aleksandr Petrosyan: the shared object which will increase the let's see.

677
00:55:09.570 --> 00:55:11.939
Aleksandr Petrosyan: and that means

678
00:55:12.170 --> 00:55:13.899
Aleksandr Petrosyan: in most cases in the Us.

679
00:55:15.680 --> 00:55:18.380
Aleksandr Petrosyan: And the reason why that fails is because of it.

680
00:55:18.850 --> 00:55:21.069
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Because in this case, yeah.

681
00:55:21.810 --> 00:55:24.769
Aleksandr Petrosyan: that's the advice too much as standard Library features.

682
00:55:25.030 --> 00:55:26.490
Aleksandr Petrosyan: and some of them are not portable.

683
00:55:29.750 --> 00:55:32.089
Aleksandr Petrosyan: This should become possibly relevant.

684
00:55:34.040 --> 00:55:36.269
Aleksandr Petrosyan: but it's also a bug.

685
00:55:36.650 --> 00:55:37.290
Yeah.

686
00:55:46.940 --> 00:55:48.950
Aleksandr Petrosyan: it's probably going to be 1 point. Oh.

687
00:56:01.270 --> 00:56:02.379
Aleksandr Petrosyan: okay.

688
00:56:02.460 --> 00:56:04.040
Aleksandr Petrosyan: this is a new one.

689
00:56:05.330 --> 00:56:11.400
Aleksandr Petrosyan: I think this is used for signing down, like also the concerns of security. But it was private key instruction.

690
00:56:12.420 --> 00:56:19.639
Aleksandr Petrosyan: I mentioned that this is not like in the libraries like this are using the unsafe library to be unsafe. But I thought I should mention here.

691
00:56:22.050 --> 00:56:22.830
Okay.

692
00:56:22.860 --> 00:56:26.119
Aleksandr Petrosyan: i'm not actually familiar with this

693
00:56:26.340 --> 00:56:28.999
Aleksandr Petrosyan: issue. I would give it a

694
00:56:30.830 --> 00:56:31.790
Aleksandr Petrosyan: so

695
00:56:31.940 --> 00:56:34.540
Aleksandr Petrosyan: it definitely is security in the bug

696
00:56:36.680 --> 00:56:40.640
Aleksandr Petrosyan: marking a function. Unsafe also is a similar breakage.

697
00:56:42.540 --> 00:56:45.050
Aleksandr Petrosyan: So it was in some point. Now

698
00:56:50.640 --> 00:56:53.100
Aleksandr Petrosyan: you should probably also sign it to me.

699
00:56:55.550 --> 00:56:56.180
Yeah.

700
00:56:58.470 --> 00:56:59.500
Aleksandr Petrosyan: there we go.

701
00:57:08.880 --> 00:57:09.799
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Okay.

702
00:57:10.230 --> 00:57:11.929
This is a.

703
00:57:17.360 --> 00:57:18.560
Aleksandr Petrosyan: for example.

704
00:57:18.630 --> 00:57:20.920
Aleksandr Petrosyan: very easy to understand example

705
00:57:25.040 --> 00:57:26.250
Aleksandr Petrosyan: security.

706
00:57:27.280 --> 00:57:31.750
Aleksandr Petrosyan: because people will assume that all of the seeds have the same. They don't

707
00:57:33.410 --> 00:57:34.799
enhancement.

708
00:57:35.890 --> 00:57:37.049
Aleksandr Petrosyan: And 1 point out.

709
00:57:49.840 --> 00:57:51.649
Aleksandr Petrosyan: I think we missed one.

710
00:57:51.900 --> 00:57:52.609
Brent Zundel: Okay.

711
00:57:55.040 --> 00:57:57.430
that's the crunches of seedlings.

712
00:57:57.510 --> 00:57:59.759
Aleksandr Petrosyan: That's what we just did.

713
00:58:00.060 --> 00:58:02.350
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Sorry. How's it going to?

714
00:58:05.360 --> 00:58:06.499
Aleksandr Petrosyan: I'm a sake.

715
00:58:08.990 --> 00:58:13.320
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Yeah, this is already signed. This is documentation issue.

716
00:58:18.050 --> 00:58:19.330
Yeah.

717
00:58:20.070 --> 00:58:20.669
yeah.

718
00:58:23.930 --> 00:58:25.100
Aleksandr Petrosyan: this sounds good.

719
00:58:27.650 --> 00:58:30.629
Aleksandr Petrosyan: I wouldn't give it a month to. So it's the future.

720
00:58:31.990 --> 00:58:33.069
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Ideally.

721
00:58:36.260 --> 00:58:40.389
Aleksandr Petrosyan: ideally, this documentation should be done regardless whether or not

722
00:58:40.570 --> 00:58:41.980
Aleksandr Petrosyan: it's the same process.

723
00:58:43.160 --> 00:58:45.879
we should have addressed the ability to

724
00:58:46.090 --> 00:58:48.160
Aleksandr Petrosyan: compile us and portable mode.

725
00:58:49.750 --> 00:58:56.280
Aleksandr Petrosyan: But even when we do address it it's gonna be different. So this is gonna stay relevant to regardless of what we do

726
00:59:02.740 --> 00:59:05.010
Brent Zundel: time for at least one more.

727
00:59:07.350 --> 00:59:07.930
Brent Zundel: Okay.

728
00:59:11.600 --> 00:59:12.350
alright.

729
00:59:15.630 --> 00:59:17.900
Aleksandr Petrosyan: 26 of over 2022

730
00:59:18.090 --> 00:59:19.389
Aleksandr Petrosyan: it's been a while.

731
00:59:21.190 --> 00:59:22.919
Okay, so

732
00:59:24.420 --> 00:59:28.199
Aleksandr Petrosyan: the way that change on generation will be handled is

733
00:59:28.240 --> 00:59:30.519
Aleksandr Petrosyan: we'll just use it, gives history.

734
00:59:32.260 --> 00:59:33.830
Aleksandr Petrosyan: and using it.

735
00:59:34.500 --> 00:59:36.000
Aleksandr Petrosyan: commit messages

736
00:59:36.420 --> 00:59:38.850
Aleksandr Petrosyan: to generate short services.

737
00:59:39.150 --> 00:59:41.739
Aleksandr Petrosyan: I was done. You can see how it

738
00:59:41.900 --> 00:59:44.450
Aleksandr Petrosyan: you can see how it looks

739
00:59:45.670 --> 00:59:47.260
Aleksandr Petrosyan: fairly reliable.

740
00:59:48.790 --> 00:59:52.879
Aleksandr Petrosyan: If you could also assign this to

741
00:59:54.650 --> 00:59:56.289
Aleksandr Petrosyan: 601 D.

742
01:00:00.860 --> 01:00:02.049
Aleksandr Petrosyan: And

743
01:00:02.130 --> 01:00:03.489
Aleksandr Petrosyan: technical right? So

744
01:00:06.280 --> 01:00:09.270
Aleksandr Petrosyan: it was out of targets for one word

745
01:00:12.910 --> 01:00:14.959
Aleksandr Petrosyan: just out of yeah.

746
01:00:16.110 --> 01:00:16.779
good

747
01:00:19.830 --> 01:00:21.430
Aleksandr Petrosyan: labels, documentation.

748
01:00:24.620 --> 01:00:25.769
Aleksandr Petrosyan: c. I.

749
01:00:26.390 --> 01:00:27.439
Aleksandr Petrosyan: And Constant.

750
01:00:34.150 --> 01:00:35.409
Brent Zundel: he said. Ci.

751
01:00:35.560 --> 01:00:36.169
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Yeah.

752
01:00:36.270 --> 01:00:37.370
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Continuous integration.

753
01:00:40.190 --> 01:00:40.779
Yeah.

754
01:00:47.330 --> 01:00:48.289
Aleksandr Petrosyan: it's good to call it

755
01:01:04.110 --> 01:01:04.990
Brent Zundel: milestone.

756
01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:09.679
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Most of them

757
01:01:11.220 --> 01:01:13.169
Aleksandr Petrosyan: shouldn't affect the actual

758
01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:17.519
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Well, it's a process so it does affect one by 2.

759
01:01:22.760 --> 01:01:27.000
Brent Zundel: So I just heard back from rye on the discord

760
01:01:28.350 --> 01:01:31.910
Brent Zundel: to match the Maintainer's file.

761
01:01:35.670 --> 01:01:39.320
Aleksandr Petrosyan: I've already requested being added to that team.

762
01:01:39.380 --> 01:01:41.259
Aleksandr Petrosyan: You also have it a month.

763
01:01:44.900 --> 01:01:46.549
Aleksandr Petrosyan: We still have to see

764
01:01:47.830 --> 01:01:48.410
before

765
01:01:53.280 --> 01:01:56.529
Brent Zundel: Let's do one more. 133.

766
01:01:58.650 --> 01:02:03.530
Brent Zundel: We have a Google Doc to the July 20 s, 2,020 roadmap.

767
01:02:04.170 --> 01:02:05.009
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Yeah.

768
01:02:05.850 --> 01:02:07.379
Brent Zundel: At 1 point.

769
01:02:08.690 --> 01:02:10.080
Aleksandr Petrosyan: possibly relevant.

770
01:02:16.290 --> 01:02:22.700
Aleksandr Petrosyan: And I'm. Also we can add one by though, because it technically does contribute to us.

771
01:02:27.270 --> 01:02:29.299
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Okay.

772
01:02:29.330 --> 01:02:32.640
Aleksandr Petrosyan: it's a good start.

773
01:02:32.660 --> 01:02:33.259
Aleksandr Petrosyan: bye.

774
01:02:33.910 --> 01:02:34.870
Aleksandr Petrosyan: I mean

775
01:02:36.430 --> 01:02:40.749
Brent Zundel: we we should be able to triage the rest of them

776
01:02:41.220 --> 01:02:42.060
Brent Zundel: on it.

777
01:02:43.250 --> 01:02:44.189
Brent Zundel: and

778
01:02:45.780 --> 01:02:50.290
Brent Zundel: we will have a few solved issues.

779
01:02:50.850 --> 01:02:51.740
Brent Zundel: Excellent!

780
01:02:53.150 --> 01:02:58.140
Brent Zundel: Well, thank you both. I let's see our is our next meeting. In 2 weeks

781
01:03:01.910 --> 01:03:03.690
Dmitri Venger: I will.

782
01:03:03.760 --> 01:03:05.469
Brent Zundel: I will be traveling

783
01:03:07.040 --> 01:03:08.250
Brent Zundel: So I

784
01:03:09.320 --> 01:03:14.189
Brent Zundel: you are. I feel free to continue triaging without me. If you're comfortable doing so.

785
01:03:14.470 --> 01:03:23.280
Aleksandr Petrosyan: there's another point. You mentioned that some of the possible maintainers actually can't attend this meeting because they have a concurrent meeting.

786
01:03:24.500 --> 01:03:28.189
Dmitri Venger: so you might actually change the time as well.

787
01:03:28.350 --> 01:03:31.099
Brent Zundel: I'm. I'm open for that. Let's.

788
01:03:31.770 --> 01:03:38.309
Brent Zundel: We can try to have that discussion asynchronously, and try to set it up before what, when the next meeting would be.

789
01:03:39.750 --> 01:03:41.100
Brent Zundel: or we can just

790
01:03:41.810 --> 01:03:44.729
Brent Zundel: meet back in 4 weeks and try to figure out a better time. Then.

791
01:03:46.740 --> 01:03:47.319
Okay.

792
01:03:47.850 --> 01:03:49.259
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Okay.

793
01:03:49.900 --> 01:03:51.099
Dmitri Venger: Okay, sounds good.

794
01:04:03.920 --> 01:04:06.490
It's not so. It's possible.

795
01:04:06.530 --> 01:04:07.279
Dmitri Venger: Interesting.

796
01:04:07.810 --> 01:04:09.330
Dmitri Venger: So I'm: back up again.

797
01:04:11.580 --> 01:04:13.129
Dmitri Venger: Hmm.

798
01:04:17.340 --> 01:04:18.549
Dmitri Venger: No. The

799
01:04:19.530 --> 01:04:20.319
Okay.
