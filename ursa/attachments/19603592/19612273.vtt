00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:39.000
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Hello!

2
00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:43.710
Brent Zundel: Hello! How are you?

3
00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:46.510
Aleksandr Petrosyan: You know? Crazy? Yeah.

4
00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.089
Brent Zundel: Yes, in my back.

5
00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.499
Aleksandr Petrosyan: So I guess we were expecting a lot of people today.

6
00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.229
Brent Zundel: i'm hoping so.

7
00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:08.710
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Yeah.

8
00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:14.249
Aleksandr Petrosyan: it's a bit of a shame. We Last time we met we actually had a few actionable points, and since then

9
00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:16.340
Aleksandr Petrosyan: it's non-stop

10
00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.390
Aleksandr Petrosyan: deadline after deadline.

11
00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.350
Brent Zundel: That will stuff happens.

12
00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.720
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Yeah.

13
00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.980
it's

14
00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.640
probably

15
00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:29.400
Aleksandr Petrosyan: cool.

16
00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:30.960
Aleksandr Petrosyan: A good thing.

17
00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.950
What?

18
00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.620
Aleksandr Petrosyan: I think it's crossed. It's actually gonna

19
00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:37.060
better

20
00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.890
Aleksandr Petrosyan: actually, we

21
00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.850
Aleksandr Petrosyan: one of the last deadlines which is

22
00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:46.770
on the twentieth. So

23
00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:49.610
Aleksandr Petrosyan: it's Friday.

24
00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.570
Aleksandr Petrosyan: and we'll have a lot of resources otherwise to dedicate to us.

25
00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:57.810
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Maybe it starts going 3.

26
00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:59.640
What about

27
00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.480
Aleksandr Petrosyan: I do the cool request.

28
00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.260
Aleksandr Petrosyan: maybe maybe write some code of our own. Actually.

29
00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:08.980
Aleksandr Petrosyan: it's a bit of a

30
00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:16.420
Aleksandr Petrosyan: the the one kind of retooling that was

31
00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.600
Aleksandr Petrosyan: a little bit necessary at 1 point was

32
00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.260
Aleksandr Petrosyan: we needed to update the dependencies

33
00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:26.790
Aleksandr Petrosyan: over there Hasn't been but

34
00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:28.510
Aleksandr Petrosyan: to make sure.

35
00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:34.340
Aleksandr Petrosyan: and it isn't trivial

36
00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:35.660
and also

37
00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:36.890
Aleksandr Petrosyan: make it trivial.

38
00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.740
Yeah.

39
00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:48.170
Brent Zundel: on that note of, you know, working in ersa, and

40
00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:52.110
Brent Zundel: you know just on the topic of reducing

41
00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:53.680
Brent Zundel: barriers.

42
00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:57.560
Brent Zundel: is there?

43
00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:07.190
Brent Zundel: Is there someone on your team that you would want added as a Maintainer.

44
00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:13.060
Aleksandr Petrosyan: You know we're in a little bit of a great territory.

45
00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:16.650
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Our company is basically sinking money into you. As it is.

46
00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:21.949
Aleksandr Petrosyan: it's a big open source project, and we have something like 12 developers. There.

47
00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:26.459
Aleksandr Petrosyan: We have a hard time justifying the developers we have on, you know.

48
00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:30.960
Aleksandr Petrosyan: much less than dedicating time to supporting any one of the upstream library within

49
00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:32.560
Aleksandr Petrosyan: up.

50
00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:37.150
Aleksandr Petrosyan: I can get away with it because i'm the technique. And I can say we need this

51
00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:39.790
Aleksandr Petrosyan: because security and so on

52
00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:43.920
Aleksandr Petrosyan: anyone else, it is going to be an uphill at home.

53
00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:48.650
Aleksandr Petrosyan: I'm not saying it's a no, i'm just saying it's difficult.

54
00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:54.600
Brent Zundel: Oh, yeah, no worries. I mean, i'm just talking about adding a name to the Maintainer's list.

55
00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:07.359
Aleksandr Petrosyan: To be quite known as doing the Tsc. Ballot that that is a little bit in the backside

56
00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:11.679
Aleksandr Petrosyan: the of the 12 developers would be hired this year was

57
00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:15.519
Aleksandr Petrosyan: basically 0, who are allowed to contribute to the vote.

58
00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:20.480
Aleksandr Petrosyan: it very

59
00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:22.590
Aleksandr Petrosyan: useful.

60
00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:24.879
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Maybe we should. All of you people

61
00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:27.200
Aleksandr Petrosyan: to just an in name Only

62
00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:33.410
then there's the question, what

63
00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:37.710
Aleksandr Petrosyan: What if actually something does come up on? They actually need to do something.

64
00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:46.360
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Oh, oh.

65
00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:47.820
Aleksandr Petrosyan: I lost around with my team.

66
00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:58.600
Aleksandr Petrosyan: How many people were you applying for

67
00:05:58.910 --> 00:05:59.790
Aleksandr Petrosyan: contributions?

68
00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:01.830
Brent Zundel: Well, it's just

69
00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:03.069
Brent Zundel: the way that

70
00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:05.850
Brent Zundel: the approvals work with

71
00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:12.669
Brent Zundel: Someone from the Maintainer's list needs to approve the Pr's right. Now that list consists of me.

72
00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:19.170
Brent Zundel: cool. I don't have time, and my boss is like.

73
00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:27.979
Brent Zundel: you know, kind of eyeing my participation in Ursa sideways, anyway, because at this point my company isn't using it anymore.

74
00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:30.050
Brent Zundel: Mike

75
00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:38.270
Brent Zundel: Completely blanking on his last name, which is a shame because I literally worked with him for years.

76
00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:51.590
Brent Zundel: Mike Who wrote a good chunk of ersa, but and might have time in the future to come and work on some more stuff. But at this point

77
00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:55.639
Brent Zundel: who knows? And camara who works for

78
00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:58.219
Brent Zundel: it is nice.

79
00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:00.200
Brent Zundel: Well, he

80
00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:02.870
Brent Zundel: he's working for

81
00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:06.790
Brent Zundel: the company does micro loans in Africa.

82
00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:14.529
Brent Zundel: And they were strong into Hyper Ledger for a while, doing just like any stuff, and then they pulled away.

83
00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:16.160
Brent Zundel: And

84
00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:19.620
Brent Zundel: And so

85
00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:22.310
Brent Zundel: of those 3 maintainers

86
00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:25.339
Brent Zundel: i'm there some of the time.

87
00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:28.420
Brent Zundel: and may not be there for much longer.

88
00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:35.600
Brent Zundel: So just having another name on that list that can push the approved button on a Pr. To get things merged. Moving forward.

89
00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:37.539
Aleksandr Petrosyan: That case I me?

90
00:07:40.450 --> 00:07:41.990
Aleksandr Petrosyan: I think i'm already in the field

91
00:07:42.910 --> 00:07:45.289
Aleksandr Petrosyan: request. This is my

92
00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:46.140
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Get home.

93
00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:51.400
Aleksandr Petrosyan: I'll definitely have time to look through the Prs. At least

94
00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:54.060
Aleksandr Petrosyan: maybe contribute some code as well

95
00:07:55.170 --> 00:07:56.910
Aleksandr Petrosyan: and definitely this month.

96
00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:00.280
Aleksandr Petrosyan: we do need to get the dependencies on.

97
00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:04.919
Aleksandr Petrosyan: because it's untenable. We have to duplicate a lot of dependencies

98
00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:05.760
Aleksandr Petrosyan: as is.

99
00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:06.670
So

100
00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:13.220
Aleksandr Petrosyan: i'll ask you around the team, maybe during the next meeting we'll have

101
00:08:13.810 --> 00:08:14.400
that means.

102
00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:22.170
Aleksandr Petrosyan: But basically the idea is you need someone to be able to review the call requests not necessarily to contribute code

103
00:08:24.130 --> 00:08:24.850
right?

104
00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:33.699
Brent Zundel: Right, like anybody can submit a Pr. what we need is somebody on the receiving end that can click the yes button. This is okay.

105
00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:38.449
Brent Zundel: I can do it, and Mike sometimes shows up and does it.

106
00:08:38.470 --> 00:08:39.750
Brent Zundel: I don't know that

107
00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:42.220
Brent Zundel: cam's done it a long time. You know. It's just

108
00:08:43.850 --> 00:08:46.340
Brent Zundel: It's just one of those things that we need.

109
00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:51.609
Brent Zundel: okay, so i'm going to add you right now.

110
00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:55.090
Brent Zundel: and you live on the call.

111
00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:48.380
Brent Zundel: It is a L. E, x s, a n, d R. Oh, no, e at the end

112
00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:50.920
no, no!

113
00:09:52.210 --> 00:09:53.699
Aleksandr Petrosyan: What's funny is that I

114
00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:58.779
Aleksandr Petrosyan: I wasn't even consulted on how to spell my name, so it's permanently recorded, as this

115
00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:00.230
Aleksandr Petrosyan: abomination

116
00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:03.070
happens.

117
00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:07.130
Brent Zundel: And your github is at

118
00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:10.160
Brent Zundel: a dash.

119
00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:13.649
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Oh, good pronunciation!

120
00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:16.600
Well, thank you.

121
00:10:39.770 --> 00:10:43.070
Brent Zundel: do you participate in the

122
00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:46.939
Brent Zundel: discord channels and stuff on

123
00:10:47.170 --> 00:10:48.799
Brent Zundel: the Hyper Ledger? Discord?

124
00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:54.920
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Yes, but very early the I used to do it a lot more, but the

125
00:10:57.820 --> 00:10:59.240
Aleksandr Petrosyan: the lack of a better word.

126
00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:05.059
Aleksandr Petrosyan: deadline after deadline situation that started in September, and

127
00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:06.520
Aleksandr Petrosyan: didn't end until

128
00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:08.700
Aleksandr Petrosyan: until the day after

129
00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:10.129
Aleksandr Petrosyan: this Friday.

130
00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:13.080
Aleksandr Petrosyan: there was no balance.

131
00:11:14.070 --> 00:11:14.820
Aleksandr Petrosyan: none.

132
00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:19.999
Aleksandr Petrosyan: I I actually was length of the Csc. Election as Well.

133
00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:21.870
Aleksandr Petrosyan: I

134
00:11:22.370 --> 00:11:24.600
Aleksandr Petrosyan: basically. Produce everything in 5 min.

135
00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:27.159
Aleksandr Petrosyan: That's why I wasn't elected.

136
00:11:30.650 --> 00:11:34.270
Brent Zundel: I can't find you. I'm searching in the wrong discord. Let's try this again.

137
00:11:34.970 --> 00:11:35.580
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Oh.

138
00:11:35.630 --> 00:11:37.460
Aleksandr Petrosyan: maybe I can find you

139
00:11:38.730 --> 00:11:40.729
Aleksandr Petrosyan: us on the Hyper Ledger discord, right?

140
00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:46.000
Brent Zundel: I Currently I I found you. I just need. There's like a numeric code

Aleksandr Petrosyan: 9, 7, 3, 4,

142
00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:50.210
Brent Zundel: 9, 7, 3, 4.

143
00:12:15.570 --> 00:12:18.100
Brent Zundel: Okay. I think I've got this in

144
00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:19.540

Brent Zundel: it goes.

149
00:13:22.750 --> 00:13:24.799
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Our maintain is allowed to push the right.

150
00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:27.919
Aleksandr Petrosyan: or do they have to go through the, you know, and put the prices as well?

151
00:13:30.390 --> 00:13:32.300
Brent Zundel: They, if

152
00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:45.399
Brent Zundel: ideally, if one Maintainer submits a. Pr. There will at least be comments and approvals from other folks that are involved before things are being merged. So it should go through the regular pr process.

153
00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:49.660
Brent Zundel: I believe they have the power to

154
00:13:50.910 --> 00:13:52.650
Brent Zundel: merge directly, but I

155
00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:56.800
Brent Zundel: honestly it's been so long since I've looked at the buttons.

156
00:13:57.620 --> 00:13:58.260
Oh.

157
00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:02.139
Aleksandr Petrosyan: i'm sure the better question is, if

158
00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:04.410
Aleksandr Petrosyan: I needed to force push.

159
00:14:05.210 --> 00:14:07.450
Aleksandr Petrosyan: to correct some sign offs at some point.

160
00:14:08.370 --> 00:14:11.510
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Will that be considered a huge in fractional just to

161
00:14:12.430 --> 00:14:13.700
Aleksandr Petrosyan: in the last hotel.

162
00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:15.990
Brent Zundel: I

163
00:14:16.630 --> 00:14:18.340
Brent Zundel: I don't think that

164
00:14:20.190 --> 00:14:21.339
Brent Zundel: anybody would

165
00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:23.109
Brent Zundel: consider that

166
00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:24.910
Brent Zundel: a huge infraction.

167
00:14:25.780 --> 00:14:26.490
Okay.

168
00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:33.020
Aleksandr Petrosyan: we got a situation where we don't have where we have to. We commit

169
00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:35.470
Aleksandr Petrosyan: around the hunting commits because

170
00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:39.890
Aleksandr Petrosyan: one of the earliest signos was with a github rather than that.

171
00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:41.949
Aleksandr Petrosyan: an actual personal email

172
00:14:42.030 --> 00:14:43.060
Aleksandr Petrosyan: so that you sign up for

173
00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:43.680
basically.

174
00:14:43.710 --> 00:14:44.530
use this?

175
00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:48.530
Brent Zundel: Oh, yeah, the d smell stuff. That stuff is

176
00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:50.320
Brent Zundel: very annoying when it gets

177
00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:51.610
Brent Zundel: punched out.

178
00:14:53.110 --> 00:14:55.860
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Our solution was to disable the

179
00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:04.060
Brent Zundel: alright.

180
00:15:04.450 --> 00:15:05.790
Brent Zundel: Oh, no, no, go ahead.

181
00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:07.930
Aleksandr Petrosyan: No

182
00:15:10.950 --> 00:15:11.599
go ahead.

183
00:15:11.630 --> 00:15:18.590
Brent Zundel: I was gonna say that the Pr. Is in it's going through the ci checks and everything which

184
00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:24.089
Brent Zundel: I can't imagine. We'll have a problem because i'm changing one line in a single file.

185
00:15:27.130 --> 00:15:30.600
Aleksandr Petrosyan: You should actually tune the Ci to. And all these things

186
00:15:33.150 --> 00:15:38.629
Brent Zundel: I I don't disagree, but that's definitely outside of my

187
00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:43.570
Aleksandr Petrosyan: i'm a little bit of a double. So

188
00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:46.630
Aleksandr Petrosyan: okay.

189
00:15:48.690 --> 00:15:52.379
Aleksandr Petrosyan: and I can definitely see that the warnings and i'll consider that as

190
00:15:56.710 --> 00:15:57.930
Aleksandr Petrosyan: the formatting is.

191
00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:04.230
Brent Zundel: is the formatting off

192
00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:07.240
Aleksandr Petrosyan: the formatting is correct.

193
00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:08.880
Aleksandr Petrosyan: how do I know

194
00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:12.710
Aleksandr Petrosyan: it wouldn't affect anything because you didn't touch any source code.

195
00:16:14.650 --> 00:16:17.339
Aleksandr Petrosyan: The bigger question is most of the time

196
00:16:17.410 --> 00:16:22.490
Aleksandr Petrosyan: on bigger projects enable W. Or in rust. The equipment is treating all

197
00:16:22.630 --> 00:16:24.000
Aleksandr Petrosyan: warnings as

198
00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:30.479
Aleksandr Petrosyan: and usually don't care about the formatting much.

199
00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:37.280
Aleksandr Petrosyan: And as long as I can tell you, not actually caching the

200
00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:38.810
artifacts.

201
00:16:40.090 --> 00:16:40.730
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Yeah.

202
00:16:40.930 --> 00:16:42.410
Aleksandr Petrosyan: lots of room for improvements.

203
00:16:42.990 --> 00:16:44.630
Brent Zundel: I am sure of that.

204
00:16:46.330 --> 00:16:52.299
Brent Zundel: So Pr: 218 once it's through, or at any point you are more than welcome to jump in and

205
00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:56.239
Brent Zundel: throw your approval on there, just to show that it's being done with your knowledge.

206
00:16:56.570 --> 00:16:57.420
Brent Zundel: And so

207
00:17:01.070 --> 00:17:03.549
Brent Zundel: I can turn my Google on there. And

208
00:17:03.780 --> 00:17:04.770
Brent Zundel: i'm good.

209
00:17:04.839 --> 00:17:05.859
Brent Zundel: added

210
00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:09.890
Brent Zundel: water, Mike Water. I remember

211
00:17:14.690 --> 00:17:15.310
right.

212
00:17:21.869 --> 00:17:22.690
since

213
00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:25.769
Aleksandr Petrosyan: out of the comment, just in case

214
00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:42.400
Aleksandr Petrosyan: how many

215
00:17:43.030 --> 00:17:45.190
Aleksandr Petrosyan: projects in hyperl are using rust.

216
00:17:45.790 --> 00:17:47.909
Aleksandr Petrosyan: i'm going to throw that close a little bit, but

217
00:17:48.370 --> 00:17:50.589
Aleksandr Petrosyan: it goes shockingly more popular.

218
00:17:55.370 --> 00:17:57.620
Aleksandr Petrosyan: I know it's little hard. Aries

219
00:17:57.640 --> 00:17:59.050
another

220
00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:01.550
that's basically it.

221
00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:04.050
Brent Zundel: Yeah, not as many as i'd like

222
00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:07.609
Brent Zundel: that a pretty high opinion of of

223
00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:10.310
Brent Zundel: there was

224
00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:15.410
Brent Zundel: years and years back. There was very serious talk about

225
00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:17.179
Brent Zundel: porting in the

226
00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:19.130
Brent Zundel: to rust

227
00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:27.980
Brent Zundel: And actually the if I remember the Indie SDK is in Rusk already, but it's the

228
00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:35.170
Brent Zundel: it's the actual Indie plenum and the ledger code that's still in python of all things.

229
00:18:36.910 --> 00:18:42.759
Brent Zundel: So who? Yeah, there was like very serious conversations around we we should really do this. But you know, like

230
00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:49.640
Brent Zundel: is common with open source projects. Well, who's got the resources and time to actually do that?

231
00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:52.870
Brent Zundel: And how confident are we that it's still going to work with that?

232
00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:56.129
It was.

233
00:18:57.680 --> 00:18:59.930
Brent Zundel: But yeah, not as much rest as i'd like to see.

234
00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:05.440
Brent Zundel: though, from what I understand the

235
00:19:05.620 --> 00:19:08.660
Brent Zundel: there's some go that's being written, that's

236
00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:10.389
that's pretty decent as well.

237
00:19:12.790 --> 00:19:14.679
I'm not a big time ago.

238
00:19:16.330 --> 00:19:18.889
Aleksandr Petrosyan: I respect the people designing it.

239
00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:21.349
Aleksandr Petrosyan: The design itself Structural time, I think

240
00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:22.590
it was just.

241
00:19:23.010 --> 00:19:23.860
Aleksandr Petrosyan: It's.

242
00:19:24.180 --> 00:19:25.100
It's like

243
00:19:25.270 --> 00:19:27.890
Aleksandr Petrosyan: is hindsight to 30 years

244
00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:30.669
Aleksandr Petrosyan: of what everyone, including people

245
00:19:30.910 --> 00:19:31.929
Aleksandr Petrosyan: to a design

246
00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:35.839
really in brilliant languages like this.

247
00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:38.350
Aleksandr Petrosyan: and terrible, terrible languages like this.

248
00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:42.150
Aleksandr Petrosyan: I have taught you about how to do these things.

249
00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:45.500
Aleksandr Petrosyan: and you throw it all away.

250
00:19:45.630 --> 00:19:47.650
Aleksandr Petrosyan: You say let's reinvent the deal

251
00:19:48.290 --> 00:19:50.069
Aleksandr Petrosyan: based on something that we know. Doesn't.

252
00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:56.750
It's

253
00:19:56.970 --> 00:19:59.240
Aleksandr Petrosyan: not that I have any objection to this.

254
00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:00.750
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Go, that's written.

255
00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:02.580
It's just not. The

256
00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:06.770
Aleksandr Petrosyan: rust has a low, high barrier of entry.

257
00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:09.240
Aleksandr Petrosyan: because you have to get through the borrowed checker

258
00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:11.350
Aleksandr Petrosyan: by the time you finish the events.

259
00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:15.830
Aleksandr Petrosyan: quite another venture. You've learned a lot.

260
00:20:15.970 --> 00:20:20.159
Aleksandr Petrosyan: would go. It's not the same. It's it actually lets you get away with

261
00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:25.139
Aleksandr Petrosyan: talk too much, and by the time you've finished with the tutorial you already picked up a few about habits.

262
00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:33.599
Aleksandr Petrosyan: But then again it's. It's all in the program.

263
00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:36.230
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Emphasis on

264
00:20:40.650 --> 00:20:42.230
Aleksandr Petrosyan: this is an engineer, actually.

265
00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:45.359
Aleksandr Petrosyan: because it a good design, even in a good language.

266
00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:51.159
Aleksandr Petrosyan: You know a bad language or flourish on the planet Design, even with a good language, will just die out.

267
00:20:57.060 --> 00:21:00.259
Brent Zundel: It's in point. There's a lot of C still out there.

268
00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:02.390
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Good. See

269
00:21:02.430 --> 00:21:04.170
Brent Zundel: there.

270
00:21:04.450 --> 00:21:06.090
Brent Zundel: like legitimately

271
00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:08.270
Brent Zundel: solid. See, I mean

272
00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:12.420
Brent Zundel: the the Linux kernel is my favorite example of that

273
00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:14.220
Brent Zundel: works really well.

274
00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:17.700
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Well, it

275
00:21:18.090 --> 00:21:22.699
Brent Zundel: at least for a certain measure of works, really. Well, I guess. Here

276
00:21:23.710 --> 00:21:24.799
Brent Zundel: you're on Linux

277
00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:28.840
Aleksandr Petrosyan: I contributed

278
00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:31.600
Aleksandr Petrosyan: little bit of code system that it's Eric controllers

279
00:21:32.210 --> 00:21:33.200
Aleksandr Petrosyan: back in my day

280
00:21:34.790 --> 00:21:38.400
Aleksandr Petrosyan: and i'm really happy that they introduced us into the kernel.

281
00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:43.939
Aleksandr Petrosyan: because the kind of thing that you'd be writing

282
00:21:43.970 --> 00:21:47.440
Aleksandr Petrosyan: isn't the kind of thing that you trust to

283
00:21:47.710 --> 00:21:52.230
Aleksandr Petrosyan: seeing all this to do most of the contributions are from scene offices.

284
00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:58.040
Aleksandr Petrosyan: It's it's better to spend a little more time compiling and being certain that you

285
00:21:58.330 --> 00:21:59.969
Aleksandr Petrosyan: they haven't made a mistake rather than

286
00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:05.700
Aleksandr Petrosyan: having

287
00:22:05.770 --> 00:22:07.359
Aleksandr Petrosyan: a controller that use it.

288
00:22:07.710 --> 00:22:08.859
Aleksandr Petrosyan: What is used

289
00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:11.090
Aleksandr Petrosyan: in some lab somewhere.

290
00:22:17.650 --> 00:22:24.359
Aleksandr Petrosyan: You actually wouldn't believe what the code is for. There's a there's an apple 2 computer in the Cabin Mission laboratory in Cambridge.

291
00:22:26.910 --> 00:22:31.510
Aleksandr Petrosyan: I really wanted to move to a somewhat modern operating system

292
00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:34.679
Aleksandr Petrosyan: still made if you purchase the Linux

293
00:22:36.350 --> 00:22:39.829
Aleksandr Petrosyan: so that you could remove everything else. And if you fitted to the

294
00:22:39.860 --> 00:22:40.539
to be able to run

295
00:22:42.100 --> 00:22:47.320
Aleksandr Petrosyan: least compatible software things that you could compile on a regular PC, and then just

296
00:22:47.540 --> 00:22:49.410
Aleksandr Petrosyan: move into it.

297
00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:55.360
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Yeah, it works.

298
00:22:55.930 --> 00:22:57.520
Aleksandr Petrosyan: It was shockingly well.

299
00:23:00.260 --> 00:23:06.780
Aleksandr Petrosyan: They returned to the apple, too, because it had some software which was designed specifically for the application.

300
00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:09.030
Aleksandr Petrosyan: It was proprietary. So you couldn't reverse, engineer.

301
00:23:09.810 --> 00:23:11.400
Let it run the control of it

302
00:23:12.530 --> 00:23:13.880
Aleksandr Petrosyan: this one while I lost it.

303
00:23:18.940 --> 00:23:22.059
Aleksandr Petrosyan: I guess we are not going to be joined by anyone

304
00:23:22.590 --> 00:23:23.850
Brent Zundel: doesn't look like it.

305
00:23:24.090 --> 00:23:32.860
Brent Zundel: so in addition to the comment, if you're able to, just like, if you go to the files, changed, tab and approve

306
00:23:33.090 --> 00:23:35.100
Brent Zundel: normal. Yeah, Well, there.

307
00:23:36.130 --> 00:23:39.710
Brent Zundel: and I will ping Mike and cam

308
00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:42.729
Brent Zundel: to see if they can jump in and approve it.

309
00:23:42.790 --> 00:23:43.930
Brent Zundel: And

310
00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:46.189
Brent Zundel: yeah, we'll get

311
00:23:47.820 --> 00:23:48.440
good.

312
00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:51.489
Aleksandr Petrosyan: so just the roadmap for what we're going to be doing.

313
00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:55.730
Aleksandr Petrosyan: My guess is

314
00:23:56.670 --> 00:24:01.110
Aleksandr Petrosyan: next week is the earliest. I can actually start doing anything.

315
00:24:03.350 --> 00:24:10.759
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Then i'll have a look at the smaller issues like 213, maybe, as the crashes on sea length shorter than 30, divided by

316
00:24:11.490 --> 00:24:12.749
Aleksandr Petrosyan: should be an easy fix.

317
00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:14.400
Aleksandr Petrosyan: I'll bump

318
00:24:15.150 --> 00:24:16.919
Aleksandr Petrosyan: dependencies as much as I can

319
00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:22.180
Aleksandr Petrosyan: The conditional compilation makes it difficult, for I think it should be possible.

320
00:24:22.820 --> 00:24:23.800
Aleksandr Petrosyan: At least

321
00:24:24.130 --> 00:24:25.480
Aleksandr Petrosyan: i'll go to where it should be

322
00:24:25.610 --> 00:24:26.570
Aleksandr Petrosyan: readable.

323
00:24:27.130 --> 00:24:27.760
Hmm.

324
00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:30.560
Aleksandr Petrosyan: so the simple

325
00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:33.230
it's.

326
00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:36.180
It's a bit more complicated.

327
00:24:37.450 --> 00:24:39.959
Aleksandr Petrosyan: I think it will be resolved when

328
00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:44.160
Aleksandr Petrosyan: will be bumping the burden? It might actually come with the same

329
00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:46.059
full request.

330
00:24:47.090 --> 00:24:51.170
Aleksandr Petrosyan: I think we should probably have another meeting and discuss what's going to happen next. But

331
00:24:51.370 --> 00:24:53.809
Aleksandr Petrosyan: after that the biggest.

332
00:24:53.910 --> 00:24:54.820
Aleksandr Petrosyan: probably

333
00:24:56.100 --> 00:24:58.340
best thing to start working on is

334
00:25:00.250 --> 00:25:02.099
Aleksandr Petrosyan: adding support for

335
00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:05.300
Aleksandr Petrosyan: undeprecated libraries like this era.

336
00:25:05.450 --> 00:25:06.140
anyhow.

337
00:25:06.810 --> 00:25:07.619
Aleksandr Petrosyan: 199.

338
00:25:08.470 --> 00:25:09.120
Brent Zundel: Yeah.

339
00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:14.220
Aleksandr Petrosyan: After those are done we can start talking about

340
00:25:14.460 --> 00:25:15.170
Aleksandr Petrosyan: changing

341
00:25:15.430 --> 00:25:16.300
the structure

342
00:25:16.660 --> 00:25:17.490
great.

343
00:25:17.630 --> 00:25:21.860
Aleksandr Petrosyan: making it it's lots of smaller crates which are compiled separately rather than a single

344
00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:24.099
Aleksandr Petrosyan: single one with most features.

345
00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:29.710
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Hopefully. They will also help in organizing the code.

346
00:25:31.340 --> 00:25:31.990
because

347
00:25:32.670 --> 00:25:35.709
Aleksandr Petrosyan: right now it's not quite as obvious as

348
00:25:35.910 --> 00:25:37.240
Aleksandr Petrosyan: you'd like to be.

349
00:25:38.050 --> 00:25:42.220
Aleksandr Petrosyan: which create, or rather, which module is responsible, for which functionality

350
00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:46.630
Aleksandr Petrosyan: it's all over the place and grouped by algorithm rather than by functionality.

351
00:25:47.270 --> 00:25:49.590
Brent Zundel: Yeah, Usually, if you're using.

352
00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:53.569
Aleksandr Petrosyan: if you're using something, you're not actually interested in the algorithm

353
00:25:53.630 --> 00:25:54.910
Aleksandr Petrosyan: you're interested in

354
00:25:55.870 --> 00:25:59.299
Aleksandr Petrosyan: either encryption, decryption, thresholds, etc.

355
00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:01.230
Aleksandr Petrosyan: and those things

356
00:26:01.530 --> 00:26:08.650
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Mit, c.

357
00:26:09.030 --> 00:26:11.350
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Or you could import each of them individually.

358
00:26:12.990 --> 00:26:14.240
Aleksandr Petrosyan: and that will

359
00:26:14.470 --> 00:26:17.519
Aleksandr Petrosyan: probably cut down on the compilation time as well.

360
00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:20.509
Aleksandr Petrosyan: because then you can explicitly define.

361
00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:21.280
You want

362
00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:23.160
no

363
00:26:23.290 --> 00:26:24.640
Aleksandr Petrosyan: recompiled every time you

364
00:26:26.270 --> 00:26:27.999
Aleksandr Petrosyan: right.

365
00:26:30.770 --> 00:26:33.489
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Do you really need to upload the roadmap

366
00:26:34.710 --> 00:26:36.810
Aleksandr Petrosyan: before we do it? What do we need to do after

367
00:26:41.850 --> 00:26:42.879
Brent Zundel: I

368
00:26:43.830 --> 00:26:47.440
Brent Zundel: What you outlined just now is

369
00:26:47.620 --> 00:26:51.240
Brent Zundel: in line with my understanding of where we want to go, and I wanted to go.

370
00:26:53.090 --> 00:26:54.090
Brent Zundel: And so

371
00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:58.029
Brent Zundel: I think we got to just start seeing. Pr.

372
00:26:58.870 --> 00:26:59.450
Okay.

373
00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:01.390
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Okay, in case

374
00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:02.170
Oh.

375
00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:06.949
Aleksandr Petrosyan: i'll address the issues which were assigned to me.

376
00:27:07.580 --> 00:27:09.399
Aleksandr Petrosyan: I'll let you self assign it to you

377
00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:12.929
Aleksandr Petrosyan: the ones that I mentioned.

378
00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:17.210
Aleksandr Petrosyan: yeah.

379
00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:25.540
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Like, I said. The reason why I haven't contributed previously was

380
00:27:28.550 --> 00:27:31.089
Aleksandr Petrosyan: the precarious, for we do need us, and we

381
00:27:31.670 --> 00:27:35.149
Aleksandr Petrosyan: I really want to have a point on my busy, my

382
00:27:36.020 --> 00:27:37.360
Aleksandr Petrosyan: cryptographic library

383
00:27:39.020 --> 00:27:39.680
on

384
00:27:40.210 --> 00:27:42.270
Aleksandr Petrosyan: management isn't very happy with spending

385
00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:44.199
Aleksandr Petrosyan: develop a time doing this

386
00:27:44.330 --> 00:27:46.659
I might actually have to take it out and do it on my own time

387
00:27:47.070 --> 00:27:47.770
sometimes.

388
00:27:49.240 --> 00:27:49.820
Yeah.

389
00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:53.400
Aleksandr Petrosyan: it's good that we can help

390
00:27:55.590 --> 00:27:56.809
that. We can help

391
00:27:56.900 --> 00:27:58.180
Aleksandr Petrosyan: little bit more this time.

392
00:28:00.220 --> 00:28:00.850
So on.

393
00:28:03.010 --> 00:28:09.069
Brent Zundel: Well, I appreciate you being here, and next meeting is in 2 weeks, and hopefully both of us can be there as well.

394
00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:10.390
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Excellent!

395
00:28:10.590 --> 00:28:11.220
Thank you.

396
00:28:11.530 --> 00:28:12.609
Brent Zundel: Thank you, Alexander

397
00:28:16.280 --> 00:28:16.750
Bye.
