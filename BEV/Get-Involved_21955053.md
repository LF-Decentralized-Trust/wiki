**[Bevel](https://www.hyperledger.org/blog/2020/07/14/how-to-quickly-deploy-blockchain-networks-that-can-scale-to-production-with-blockchain-automation-framework-a-hyperledger-lab) (previously Blockchain Automation Framework) is a Hyperledger Accelerator for rapidly and consistently deploying production-ready DLT platforms.  Learn more in this short 7 minute video.**

 

# **You are welcome to get involved!**

[Hyperledger](https://www.hyperledger.org/), as part of the  [Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/), is an open source community and anyone who is interested is welcome to use the code, talk to others in the community and make contributions to this project.

**Some useful links to get you started:**

- [Hyperledger Bevel Github wiki](https://github.com/hyperledger/bevel/wiki)
- [Hyperledger Bevel technical documentation](https://hyperledger-bevel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- [Hyperledger Bevel Discord channel](https://discord.com/channels/905194001349627914/941475087389950002)

**Let us make your contribution journey easier.**

## **First become a user - deploy your DLT network using Hyperledger Bevel**

**Follow the [Getting Started](https://hyperledger-bevel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started/prerequisites/) Links to deploy your first network.**

The above pathway would help you to deploy a DLT/Blockchain network on a chosen cloud infrastructure using BAF.
