Arun .S.M.  
dviejo  
Sasan, Jagpreet Singh  
Sarkar, Suvajit

**Discussion items and pointers:**

- hlf-operator project is fine with it becoming a subproject within HL Bevel, as long as it can work towards its own roadmap and improvements
- Bevel v1.0 plan to host de-facto helm charts for blockchain platforms and have operators as subproject starting with hlf-operator
- Bevel will continue to have its flux helm operator for now, but might plan to revisit and makes changes around it once more platform operators are integrated/added
- As per the last discussion between hlf-operator and fabric-operator maintainers, fabric-operator project is willing to collaborate but donâ€™t have dedicated people for collaboration/merging discussions and activities
- hlf-operator to be renamed as bevel-fabric-operator
- Joint effort is required to understand how hlf-operator fabric charts would be merged with bevel fabric helm charts, so that as per the proposed flow the operator uses bevel helm charts
- Certificates and credential storage and usage in hlf-operator needs to relooked to make it compatible with bevel code / charts
- hlf-operator will have sprint and other project ceremonies combined with bevel ceremonies, but will maintain a separate project board and repository

**Action items:**

dviejo to list gaps and feature differences between fabric-operator, which would useful in documentation and further discussion on working towards single operator  
dviejo to work on architecture diagram for hlf-operator
