  - The PR above was started by SICPA but they currently don't have the resources to finish it, so we're looking for someone who would like to take over the effort.
  - In the meantime, Timo will create a new branch where we keep the work that has been done in the PR and that we can keep up to date with the main to some extent.
- Flaky tests are being flaky even more
