## Agenda

- [PRs](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/pulls)
- PR 3095 - cherry pick for a 0.12.x and 0.11.x release, and try out the LTS support process.
- [Issues](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/issues)
  
  - Looking at the ARM issue still – nice to have before 1.0.0 final.
  - [Ian Costanzo](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/5a90a1b054c8ff39bc246426?ref=confluence)  is looking at the AATH failures, likely to do with the AnonCreds W3C VCDM changes.
- 1.0.0 Left To Do?
  
  - How is testing going? So far so good, but still to be completed.
  - RC4 does not have the AnonCreds W3C VCDM changes and as such we'll likely need an RC5
- Open Discussion
