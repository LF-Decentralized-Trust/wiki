## Agenda

- PR Review - [https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/pulls](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/pulls)
- Finalizing 0.10.0 - #2409 first, rc1, and then final
- AnonCreds Progress/Next Steps - finish off BDD tests, existing endpoints + existing tests
  
  - Merging main into anoncreds branch.
  - What to do with the CredX changes –
- Issues Review - [https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/issues](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/issues)
- Open Discussion
  
  - Sonar Cloud - is this actually working? Add issue to take a look – perhaps Wade or Jason Syrotuck.
  - OpenAPI - Indicio is doing post processing on the OpenAPI file, because what is in the repo is not especially useful.
    
    - too many values being marked as optional – especially on receipt of results from the Admin API.
    - multiple use of the schema – technically they are optional in other places, but not in the OpenAPI
    - Response schemas aren't enforced allowing for returned values to differ
  - Peer DID
    
    - Good progress.
    - An issue with the peer did library: [https://github.com/sicpa-dlab/peer-did-python/issues/60](https://github.com/sicpa-dlab/peer-did-python/issues/60)
  - Code coverage reports on ACA-Py
  - Resolved, new indy-tails-server released.
    
    - We can't open PRs to the bcgov/indy-tails-server repo; we've got the necessary changes to support uploading tails files by hash in our fork but don't have anywhere for these changes to go
  - Done:
    
    - When do we stop running tests with Indy wallets? AKA When should we move BDD tests to using images without Indy SDK cause it will make our tests a lot faster
  - Quick thoughts on OpenID4VCI/VP
- did:peer work
