Aries empowers us to develop solutions with confidence and security, knowing they are supported by a trustworthy Aries community whose values resonate with ours."
> 
> *- Jorge Flores, Co-founder and CTO, Entidad*

> "My team builds solutions that incorporate decentralized identity and rely on Aries standards and projects. Aries provides a foundation that allows us to build or add onto solutions while making them easier to use, simplifying integration, protecting privacy, and enhancing security."
> 
> *- Mike Ebert, Enterprise Team Lead, Indicio*

> "We support the implementation of Aries derived from SSI. We spread the value of Web3 and provide Aries' mobile app, agent, and application services as SaaS services so that many people can easily adopt private certificates."

> "As we use picos to develop decentralized applications, we are confident that DIDs and DIDComm v2 will help us identify the various actors and allow them to communicate securely with each other. We have followed the Aries community since its inception and are grateful for the technologies developed therein."
