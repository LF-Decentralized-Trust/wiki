      - Differs from Indy Wallet architecture by separating out auth and access control. Intention is to ensure a smooth transition from Indy.
      - Ability to export keys under certain conditions (metadata is set upon key creation)

  - Revocation support has merged into master and is likely to included in the next release. Some smoothing of the edges happening.
