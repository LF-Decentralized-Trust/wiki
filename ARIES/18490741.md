## Agenda

- Open Source Mobile Agent - Aries Bifold? - James Ebert (Indicio)
  
  - [Meetings](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/ARIES/Aries+Bifold+User+Group+Meetings) - Next Wednesday (Feb. 24) the hour before the Aries WG Call
  - Repo: [https://github.com/Indicio-tech/aries-bifold](https://github.com/Indicio-tech/aries-bifold); there is a second repo that is the underlying layer, between the rn-indy-sdk and Bifold
    
    - Interestingly, Animo has a like named repo that is the UI part, with Aries Framework - JavaScript as the layer below the mobile UI.
  - There are currently at least 6 mobile stacks in the community
    
    - Xamarin/Aries Framework Go (many)
    - React Native/rn-indy-sdk (Bifold)
    - React Native/Aries Framework - JavaScript (Animo)
    - Flutter (iGrant)
    - IOS Native (Swift)
    - Android Native
  - Goal of an open source wallet collaboration is to combine the engineering effort to move faster, focus on UX and the protocols to support UX, interop testing automation, Aries features (ledgers, cred. formats)
  - Let's get started on this – starting at the meeting next Wednesday (above).
- Aries Exit from Incubation
  
  - Criteria: [https://tsc.hyperledger.org/project-incubation-exit.html](https://tsc.hyperledger.org/project-incubation-exit.html); Hyperledger Aries Request: [Hyperledger Aries Proposal to Exit Incubation Status](Hyperledger-Aries-Proposal-to-Exit-Incubation-Status_18490531.html)
  - Formal request made to the TSC today, likely on the TSC agenda next week.
  - Please review the request document, add your name to it if you agree, review and update the document as you see fit.

    - The PR to the PR is ready to be accepted
    - We will have Sub-targets
    - The Credential Exchange protocols have been moved to the primary target

    - We need new RFCs for the Indy AnonCreds, JSON-LD and BBS+ sub-targets to describe the credential exchange attachments for each
      
      - [Daniel Hardman](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/557058:d8f2338c-759d-4e0c-bb47-14386507f414?ref=confluence) agreed to create the Indy one

      - The BBS+ one will likely be an evolution of the JSON-LD one
      - Draft and review preparation to be done for next week's meeting.
    - Remove Credential Manifest as a sub-target
      
      - [Timo Glastra](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/5f64a069a1048d0069073500?ref=confluence) is working on a minimal implementation of a replacement suitable for the issue-credential protocol and will include that in the new RFC mentioned above.
    - Presentation Exchange RFC – [George Aristy](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/712020:a54e9044-6519-4da3-84ed-b85f302c0029?ref=confluence)to review/revise the [RFC 0510-dif-pres-exch](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/features/0510-dif-pres-exch-attach) as needed, mainly to nail down the specific version of the PE spec to use.
    - DIDComm message envelope RFC – [Troy Ronda](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/557058:c854f35a-2b58-4be3-9003-ca2a67495580?ref=confluence)to provide an overview of his [RFC 0587 PR](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/pull/587), including, effort needed to add support to the frameworks, what a community update would look like, and how to use OOB (and DIDDoc?) to express what is supported by the sending agent.
      
      - Really hope to see [Tomislav Markovski](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/557058:ee5efbab-32e0-460e-ad0f-e16694c7707c?ref=confluence) [Andrew Whitehead](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/557058:03322b63-53ed-4272-9c4a-a256b19c7098?ref=confluence) [Timo Glastra](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/5f64a069a1048d0069073500?ref=confluence) at the meeting to assess the impact on the three major open source Aries implementations.

## Next Week
