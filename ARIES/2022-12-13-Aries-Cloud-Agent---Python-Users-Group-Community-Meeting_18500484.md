## Agenda

- Persistent Queues, Caching, Redis and Horizontal Mediator Scaling
  
  - Drawing: [https://hackmd.io/dj-ZYA6NSAiEbq0vMFvlrw?view](https://hackmd.io/dj-ZYA6NSAiEbq0vMFvlrw?view)
  - Discussion about the requirements for general use
  - How mobile notifications should be used in conjunction with websockets, but not as a replacement
    
    - Could use HTTP "return-pickup", where a wallet makes an HTTP request, and in the response receives queued messages – [Aries RFC 0092](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/main/features/0092-transport-return-route)
  - From Chat:
    
    - WS connections are sticky to a mediator instance, but are subject to being disconnected, such as when you move from wifi to cell network.
      
      - From Colton Wolkins Or if the IP changes, you're not guaranteed to hit the same mediator
    - From Clecio : So, 1 queue for incoming messages? Multiple queues for outgoing messages? The processor is really just listening for incoming messages, and adding to the right queue?
    - From Dave McKay : Sequence diagrams here:[https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/blob/main/Mediation.md](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/blob/main/Mediation.md)
    - From Jason Leach : I made the assumption that “Wallets” was a mobile device thus WebSocket were needed.
    - From Jason Leach : There are few other cases I can think of where a mediator is needed.
    - From Clecio : I think all incoming messages are queue for resilience and fault tolerance. Each instance of the mediator may then process that queue and either add to the web socket queue or immediately send (http) to the target destination
    - From Clecio : I am assuming that we need to support web sockets at least for now, is that correct?
    - From Clecio : The push notification can be added later and reuse the http post strategy
- Defer to next call: Encryption Envelope for DIDComm V2
  
  - Issue to discuss: 
    
    - Encryption envelope in Askar
    - Other libraries are available (Python, Rust, others)
    - Question: Should the ACA-Py architecture remain with the envelope in Askar or use an external.
- Open Discussion

## Next Meeting

- Encryption Envelope for DIDComm V2
- What gets ACA-Py to v1.0
- Mediators, Redis and Horizontal Scaling
- Adding DIDComm V2 to ACA-Py – the encryption envelope. What is the best path forward?
- Issue [2029](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/issues/2029): Additional security controls for webhooks for multi-tenancy
- Other topics TBD
