## Agenda

- [PRs](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/pulls) and Issues – [#3224](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/issues/3224)
- OWF Submission –
- AATH ACA-Py Backchannel into ACA-Py?
  
  - Maybe – but a fair amount of work.
  - We have a dependency on AATH because of the integration tests.
  - Start – document how to run/debug AATH tests with ACA-Py.
  - Interop tests go into AATH instead of into the ACA-Py integration tests.  Make the changes there.
- did:tdw Resolver
  
  - trustdidweb-py has been library-ized, but not published to PyPi.  Does resolve DIDs properly, but needs caching controls – check if we can use the caching built into the ACA-Py DID Resolver layer.
  - Continue on...
- Progress on other initiatives:
  
  - OpenID4VCs plugin - Indicio team focus – new plugin that includes OpenID4VP (JWT-VC and JWT-VP supported) and a demo to clearly shows what is going on. DID JWK looks like a good inclusion in the plugin.
    
    - Next focus is adding in SD-JWT support – issuance and presentation.
  - Kudos – dependabot management in ACA-Py Plugins (20 minutes a week!!) – Nice work Jamie Hale!!
- Open Discussion
  
  - Urgent request to complete did:indy support (e.g., JSON-LD VCs based on did:indy DIDs) – triggering learnings about DID handling.  [Daniel Bluhm](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/712020:c322d585-d6d2-4479-a990-b91fac45db1c?ref=confluence) to assemble those learnings and share as work proceeds.
