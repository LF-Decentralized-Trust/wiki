## Agenda

- Status: Adding support in ACA-Py for AnonCreds in W3C VCDM Format
  
  - PR for the issue credential is working.  Review, tag, and then hopefully merge.
  - PR is pending on the proof request – Ian to check on that.
- Status: Upgrading Wallet Types
  
  - Looking at the holder side – the handling of the link secret (renamed from master secret to link secret) – exposed by running the demo.
    
    - Case: Have credential, get a new credential of the same type, goes down a different path – being investigated.
  - Noted a different problem – if you have multiple credentials and you revoke one, the verification fails – to be investigated.
  - Questions about the fact that the wallet upgrade is from Askar CredX to Askar AnonCreds-RS
    
    - If a deployment is on Indy Wallet they have to do the Indy-Askar update first, then the CredX to AnonCreds-RS
- Status: Logging in ACA-Py
  
  - Considering refactoring.
- aiohttp [CVE](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-5m98-qgg9-wh84) and older ACA-Py releases
  
  - CVE – crafted query can cause an infinite loop
  - 0.12.1 has been upgraded to the patched version.
  - We need to get the other instances of ACA-Py based Aries repos updated.
  - Do we patch 0.11.0?  Earlier?
- Getting to 1.0.0
- [PRs](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/pulls)
- [Issues](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/issues)
- What's the next priority?
- Open Discussion

## Upcoming Meeting Topics:

## Future Topics

- Sonar Cloud - is this actually working? Add issue to take a look – perhaps Wade or Jason Syrotuck.
- OpenAPI - Indicio is doing post processing on the OpenAPI file, because what is in the repo is not especially useful.
  
  - too many values being marked as optional – especially on receipt of results from the Admin API.
  - multiple use of the schema – technically they are optional in other places, but not in the OpenAPI
  - Response schemas aren't enforced allowing for returned values to differ
- Code coverage reports on ACA-Py
