## RFC Progress

## Other Business

Future of this meeting

- We recognize as a community that each of us needs to adapt to current global events: improving the upstream open source libraries is likely to be slower.
  
  - No apology is needed if people take longer to respond to things.
  - Richard's role changed, so we need a change in host.
    
    - [Robert Mitwicki](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/712020:9176fc40-350e-4342-b616-01da76989d8d?ref=confluence) will coordinate the meeting going forward
  - Fewer meetings and more async collaboration?
