  - Documentation (Readme files) should note that a mediator is not always functionally required.
    
    - verbose option: Mediators and Relays RFC
    - terse option: a paragraph or two. Copied to each repo, or as an anchored link in the above RFC?
  - aries-mediator-\[language]? languages ready: go, dotnet, rust (absa)
    
    - binary &amp; docker image that wraps an existing framework? (e.g., aries-mediator-go as an instance of aries-framework-go)
- DIDExchange Repo Progress
  
  - OOB Linked In ([PR 454](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/pull/454))
  - Signed Attachments ([PR 456](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/pull/456))
  - Reuse-accepted ([PR 455](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/pull/455))
  - What's missing?
    
    - Role Names ([Issue 457](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/issues/457))
