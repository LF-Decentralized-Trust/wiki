## Announcements

## Agenda

- Outcomes from last AATH Users Group Meeting
- Demo
  
  - We (IDLab) would like to announce a closed beta for our interoperability-bench platform during this week's Aries Test Harness Users Group meeting.
    
    We will be running this beta through the month of October. Our first plugins to be made available is a private instance of AATH-as-a-Service. Some have seen a preview of this during the Hyperledger Interop-a-thon.
    
    If there is time at the agenda we want to run a short features demo and further ignite discussions.
    
    Current features include:
    
    - 4 roles &amp; 4 available backchannels (acapy, afj, dotnet, mobile)
    
    - Tag selection
    
    - Publicly exposed endpoints for integration (backchannel, agent, api and webhooks)
    
    - Integrated UI for mobile testing
    
    - Automated reporting with a private allure instance
    
    We will be looking for feedback and feature requests in order to built a tool that is useful for the community.
- In-depth Approach review
  
  - Mobile backchannel work to integrate with other Aries frameworks, right now it is an acapy backchannel
  - Expanding the AFJ Backchannel to cover more defined tests like AIP 2.
  - Does it make sense to label as set of AATH Interop tests as SmokeTests. Will they apply to all Aries Frameworks? 
    
    - Issue: [Define a set of @SmokeTest scenarios](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/aries-agent--mobile-test-harnesses-6261474397580b0014247f32/issues/hyperledger/aries-agent-test-harness/534)
- AATH/AMTH Kanban Board Walkthrough
  
  - [https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/aries-agent--mobile-test-harnesses-6261474397580b0014247f32/board](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/aries-agent--mobile-test-harnesses-6261474397580b0014247f32/board)

    - In Progress
    - Short Term Backlog
    - Product Backlog
    - New Items

## Next Meeting

- Oct 27th 11AM Eastern

## Future Topics

- Continued conversation on Mobile backchannel work to integrate with other Aries frameworks
- Expanding the AFJ Backchannel to cover more defined tests like AIP 2.
- Does it make sense to label as set of AATH Interop tests as SmokeTests. Will they apply to all Aries Frameworks?

## Action items

- Patrick and Sheldon to talk about how to attach logs to tests in Allure
- Patrick to add people to the Interoperability-Bench Platform beta as requests are received.
- Sheldon to dive deeper into the Mobile backchannel (Holder) working with other Aries frameworks as Issuer and Verifier.
