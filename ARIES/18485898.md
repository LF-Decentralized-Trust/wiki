    - Can be done in Ursa with two steps, but might add as a single function call.

## RFC Progress

## Other Business

Future of this meeting

- We recognize as a community that each of us needs to adapt to current global events: improving the upstream open source libraries is likely to be slower.
  
  - No apology is needed if people take longer to respond to things.
  - Richard's role changed, so we need a change in host.
  - Fewer meetings and more async collaboration?
