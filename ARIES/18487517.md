# Hyperledger Aries : 2020-07-01-A Aries Working Group Call (AMER morning)

Created by Robert Mitwicki, last modified on Jul 01, 2020

## Summary:

- Work updates
- Transferable reputation via VC (Mike Richardson - EuroLedger)
  
  - Topic to discuss:
    
    \- Proxy Issuer Wallet: is this a bit too much of a centralised data store?
    
    - Website Authentication, use of Trinsic connection Ids, or DIDs for user passcode?
    
    - Lack of revocation notifications: is this a problem?
    
    - Synchronizing upstream and downstream platforms (ie issuer and verifier) where credentials change
    
    - Wallet management: are we in danger of "credential proliferation"?
- Optional: Wallets - do we need certification and who can do it? [Robert Mitwicki](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/712020:9176fc40-350e-4342-b616-01da76989d8d?ref=confluence)
