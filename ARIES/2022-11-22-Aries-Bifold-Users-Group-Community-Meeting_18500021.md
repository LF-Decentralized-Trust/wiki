## Announcements

- IIW35: Noteworthy for Bifold because the Open Wallet Foundation is to “create a wallet engine for everyone to use to build a wallet” and many different groups want to have their wallet as the basis for that, including Aries. Unfortunately it was sold out and none of the Bifold maintainers made it. Hopefully a few from our team like Stephen Curran were knowledgable enough to share our viewpoint.

## Agenda

- High-priority bugs
  
  - Report on first credential issuance bug
    
    - indy-vdr (with iOS too many open files bug fixes)
    - did-indy would really help resolve issues here
- Review PRs
- RN 0.70.0 Update
- Architecture conversation.

## Next Meeting

- Akiff to look into V1 vs V2 changes (present proof and issue credential) to Bifold and give an update.

## Future Topics

- Machine Readable Governance Presentation - Mike
- How should we implement Machine Readable Governance?

## Action items

- Need to update Sovrin genesis file and check network availability.
- Fetch genesis transaction as part of a build step.
- Understand if the wallet can update the genesis transaction in the field (post build).
- Problem with pick-up plugin (pickup v2) with mediators. The first message is dropped.
- Clecio will help update ZMQ in indy and give a new build to James.
- James to present some architecture ideas at the next Bifold meeting.

# Recording

- TBD
