    - Automatic offer acceptance/managing credentials
    - Machine readable governance
- Ursa
  
  - To replace libsodium, need to have a replacement for the anoncrypt / authcrypt sealed box for pack / unpack.
    
    - Can be done in Ursa with two steps, but might add as a single function call.
  - Revocation 2.0 Support - new approach: Non-Revocation Range Merkle Tree - Ursa RFC [here](https://github.com/andrewwhitehead/ursa-rfcs/tree/non-rev-tree/text/0000-revocation-range-tree)
    
    - Performance looks good at 1M creds/registry - 16M might be possible.
