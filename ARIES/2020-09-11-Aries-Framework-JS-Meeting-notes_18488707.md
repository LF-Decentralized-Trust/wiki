## Meeting Notes

- creators of DID Agent Framework (DAF) interested in project, looking for synergy.
- adding agent middleware seems like a good idea
  
  - [Timo Glastra](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/5f64a069a1048d0069073500?ref=confluence) will work out in more detail the possibilities and present next week
  - Current approach seems to lean to how express js handles middleware
- It looks like, we may need some refactoring to make the library more runtime-agnostic (Nodejs, Deno, RN) by removing hard dependency on Indy and packing the lib as pure ES6 module
- Ajay has started working on integrating the library with Deno and will create appropriate issues in Github.

## Future topics

- State machines
