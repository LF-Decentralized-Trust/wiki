## Agenda

- Finalizing 0.10.2 - 
  
  - Are we sure that both PRs from 0.10.2 are in main?
- Please Ack – DSR has a new developer that is planning to take this on.
  
  - Easy for Ack on receipt
  - Trickier for Ack on completion – how to do that without impacting all steps of all protocols...
- ACA-Py 1.0.0
  
  - What is left? [List from ACA-Py](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/blob/main/SupportedRFCs.md#aip-20)
    
    - DID Exchange – done?
    - Use DID Key?
    - Encryption Envelope?
    - Static Peer DIDs?
    - Route Coordination?
- PR Review - [https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/pulls](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/pulls)
  
  - SD-JWTs !!!!
  - orjson
    
    - Flag?
    - Spaces in JSON – really needed?
- AnonCreds Progress/Next Steps - finish off BDD tests, existing endpoints + existing tests
  
  - Continuing with Revocation
  - Incident this week that required manual revocation intervention...will that be needed in the future?
- Issues Review - [https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/issues](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/issues)
- Open Discussion
- Other Topics:
  
  - Sonar Cloud - is this actually working? Add issue to take a look – perhaps Wade or Jason Syrotuck.
  - OpenAPI - Indicio is doing post processing on the OpenAPI file, because what is in the repo is not especially useful.
    
    - too many values being marked as optional – especially on receipt of results from the Admin API.
    - multiple use of the schema – technically they are optional in other places, but not in the OpenAPI
    - Response schemas aren't enforced allowing for returned values to differ
  - Code coverage reports on ACA-Py
  - Resolved, new indy-tails-server released.
    
    - We can't open PRs to the bcgov/indy-tails-server repo; we've got the necessary changes to support uploading tails files by hash in our fork but don't have anywhere for these changes to go
  - Done:
    
    - When do we stop running tests with Indy wallets? AKA When should we move BDD tests to using images without Indy SDK cause it will make our tests a lot faster
  - Quick thoughts on OpenID4VCI/VP
- did:peer work
