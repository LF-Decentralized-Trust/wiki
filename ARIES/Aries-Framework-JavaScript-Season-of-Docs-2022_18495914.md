**Your project's problem**

Users of Aries Framework JavaScript want to build self-sovereign identity solutions using the framework, but often have a hard time because there is almost no documentation. Companies currently working with the framework have deep knowledge of the internals of the framework. Companies that have less knowledge are left to read code or ask the maintainers. There is also a lack of guidance on what is supported, and in what scenarios the framework can be used. For example there is an extension repository that I suspect few will know of: [https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-javascript-ext](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-javascript-ext). We need to guide new users of the framework on how the framework works and what you can do with it.

We would also like to grow the contributor-base of Aries Framework JavaScript in the spanish-speaking community, and having these docs in English and Spanish will help that effort.

**Your project's scope**

For now we really want to focus on improving the existing documentation and extending it for the most basic features. This includes documentation on:

\- How to create connections

\- How to issue and receive credentials

\- How to set up mediation

\- How to prove and verify proofs

This work would first be completed in English and then be translated into Spanish. 

**Measuring your project's success**

- Improved onboarding experience for new contributors, reducing friction from asking basic questions and getting started faster.
- Increased support deflections by using docs
- Docs provide effective 1 to many support, measured in fewer requests for 1:1 support from project team
- Surveying Aries Maintainers on the improvement in quality of the documentation
- Reaching existing and new developers who are Spanish speakers to grow the contributor base.
- The Hyperledger Foundation has developed active regional communities, including a Hyperledger Latinoamerica Chapter, and we will measure the success of the Spanish language documentation by observing adoption of this tool in that community and adding new contributors.
