## Agenda

- Issue PR Game: Can we merge this? (15 min):
- Protocol Semver
  
  - Additional data in protocol needs a version bump?
  - need template update per 0003
- Service Block / Endpoint URI for Agents without an endpoint ([Issue 405](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/issues/405))
  
  - Needs to know which key to encrypt for.
  - The implication is that agent will 'pick-up' messages
- DID Exchange ([RFC](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/features/0023-did-exchange/README.md))
  
  - Extraction of Invitation Protocol? - Yes (Sam if nobody beats me to it.)
    
    - note about security
    - includes inline keys described below
    - use of [~service decorator](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/features/0056-service-decorator/README.md)
      
      - inline key representations - use did:key: as a temporary solution
    - reference of [0268 Deep Linking RFC](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/concepts/0268-unified-didcomm-agent-deeplinking/README.md)
    - solve reuse problem by starting a protocol
  - pass DID Docs as attachments
    
    - replace inline ~sig with attachment signatures
- [Named states and coprotocols](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17hk6QqLW5M9E4TBPZwXIUBu9eEinMNXReceyZTF4LpA/edit) Daniel Hardman
- Chained Credentials RFC 104 - Paul/Jan
