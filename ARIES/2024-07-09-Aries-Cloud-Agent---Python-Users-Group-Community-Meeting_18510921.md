## Agenda

- Release 1.0.0rc4
  
  - Deprecating v1 Credential Exchange Protocols – PR to do that?  No – this was done in 0.12.x.
  - Add a reminder to the Changelog about that.
- OpenID4VCI Updates - [Tim Bloomfield](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/5a70c8faa02421507dce29c3?ref=confluence) 
  
  - Has JWTs support, but want to support others.
  - Adding plugin approach to enable support for others credential types – Data Integrity and mDL/mDocs
- ACA-Py conformance with the W3C VCDM 2.0 / DI-ED25519 test suite - [Patrick St-Louis](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/712020:252ecf1c-7d3b-4f2e-805d-1b747814236e?ref=confluence)
- Open [PRs](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/pulls)
- Open [Issues](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/issues):
- Finalizing LTS Handling - Issue [#2993](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/issues/2993), PR [#3051](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/pull/3051)
  
  - Outlines the strategy
  - Commits to LTS for 0.11.1 and 0.12.0
  - Initial Questions:
    
    - Policy for setting end dates for LTS.
    - Release number for an LTS – seems we need both a minor number to be the LTS (e.g., 0.11.1), but we also need to have additional releases on the branch for identified vulnerabilities – how does that work?
    - How are we notified of only the dependabot vulnerabilities that need fixing in an LTS?
- Getting to a default Arm friendly release.
  
  - Progress?
- Other hot issues.
- Open Discussion
