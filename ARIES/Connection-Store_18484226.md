# Hyperledger Aries : Connection Store

Created by Sudesh Shetty, last modified on Dec 27, 2019

This page documents design for connection storage. Connection storage will be used to all protocols for,

- Query connection records by ID or other criteria to send messages to a connection or to recognize connection of received message.
- Save/Update connection records during DID exchange message exchange

## High Level Design

##### [Connection Store](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-go/blob/c1ad21e66685fadec796a4652514a88f8be2a865/pkg/didcomm/common/didconnection/api.go) :

This component provides [features](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-go/blob/c1ad21e66685fadec796a4652514a88f8be2a865/pkg/didcomm/common/didconnection/api.go#L11) for storing and getting DID records from underlying connection store.   

##### [Connection Recorder:](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-go/blob/fa4a3fb88290dcc28423279d106eeecf0a30ceec/pkg/didcomm/protocol/didexchange/persistence.go#L43)

This component provides features for saving/updating/querying connection record from underlying did exchange store. This store is extensively used during DID exchange message exchanges to maintain connection records including state updates. Current connection recorder implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-go/blob/fa4a3fb88290dcc28423279d106eeecf0a30ceec/pkg/didcomm/protocol/didexchange/persistence.go#L43).

##### [Connection Lookup:](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-go/blob/fa4a3fb88290dcc28423279d106eeecf0a30ceec/pkg/common/connectionstore/connection_record.go#L72)

This *read-only* component provides query features for retrieving connection records including DID records from underlying DID connection and DID exchange store. This component will be extensively used by other protocols and clients to lookup connections.
