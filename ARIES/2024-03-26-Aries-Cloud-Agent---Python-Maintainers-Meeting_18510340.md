## Future Topics

- Sonar Cloud - is this actually working? Add issue to take a look – perhaps Wade or Jason Syrotuck.
- OpenAPI - Indicio is doing post processing on the OpenAPI file, because what is in the repo is not especially useful.
  
  - too many values being marked as optional – especially on receipt of results from the Admin API.
  - multiple use of the schema – technically they are optional in other places, but not in the OpenAPI
  - Response schemas aren't enforced allowing for returned values to differ
- Code coverage reports on ACA-Py
