00:22:43	Troy Ronda:	Awesome - thanks Stephen.
00:22:57	Troy Ronda:	Glad to hear about the progress on AIP.
00:24:59	Troy Ronda:	I also like the idea of having an AIP for a particular case. It would be great to start on an AIP “X” profile for more networking oriented cases (e.g., routing, relays, transports).
00:27:16	John Jordan:	There may be ways as well to use the Layers of the Trust over IP stack as a way to articulate bundles of capabilities for an agent
00:27:24	Troy Ronda:	One thing I should mention is that our focus remains on “X” profile and the more networking cases.
00:27:49	Troy Ronda:	Aries-framework-go is still an Aries project despite not supporting the full AIP 1.0. :).
00:29:44	Troy Ronda:	More contributors welcome, of course!
00:31:02	Troy Ronda:	Yeh - profiles are important.
00:31:08	Troy Ronda:	Fundamentals + profiles.
00:46:37	Daniel Bluhm:	Thanks for covering for me Ken and Sam!
01:01:52	Troy Ronda:	The first step is approved algorithms and ability to plugin the implementation.
