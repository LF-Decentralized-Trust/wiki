00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:25.620
Lance Byrd: What a what are you? Are you a teacher?

16
00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:31.899
No, I work with with Phil Wendy, who is supervising a capstone project.

17
00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:33.300
Lance Byrd: Oh, okay.

18
00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.160
Bruce Conrad: And i'm helping out with some technical expertise.

19
00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:38.399
Lance Byrd: Great.

20
00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:42.010
Bruce Conrad: and part of that is is attending this meeting. End.

21
00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.080
Lance Byrd: Good! Good. What? What the students are Where

22
00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:51.509
Bruce Conrad: and at Brigham Young University. And yeah. Great.

23
00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.609
Lance Byrd: very good. It's amazing how many SSI people are from the Utah area.

24
00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:12.229
Bruce Conrad: Yeah. evername, I think, Started started it off to a great extent. I'm not sure if there were precursors to that. That was the first group that shared it with me.

25
00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:18.579
Bruce Conrad: Gotcha. That makes sense

26
00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.560
Lance Byrd: right great.

27
00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.080
Bruce Conrad: and some of the students he he hired.

28
00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.540
Bruce Conrad: many of them are working in the industry. There are some working at in Vco.

29
00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.209
Bruce Conrad: a couple of them founded

30
00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:41.910
Lance Byrd: right?

31
00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.370
Lance Byrd: Okay, yeah. Those those connections all make sense. Then.

37
00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.010
Lance Byrd: our page here. I guess I can share my screen.

38
00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:25.190
Rodolfo Miranda: Hi, everybody!

39

Lance Byrd: We'll be getting started in about 1 min.

43
00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:05.740
Hakan: all right.

44
00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:14.990
Lance Byrd: just trying to clean up all my

45
00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.939
Lance Byrd: all my screens here 1 s.

46
00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:20.190
Lance Byrd: 10,

47
00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:25.030
Lance Byrd: good, and then.

48
00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:31.259
Lance Byrd: Now that I'm sharing, I have lost my other view.

49
00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:33.480
Lance Byrd: Come on.

50
00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:36.460
Lance Byrd: chat.

51
00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:45.000
Lance Byrd: Okay, so let's just publish this for now, so we can.

52
00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:49.340
Lance Byrd: Everybody can.

53
00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:59.180
Lance Byrd: Okay, welcome to our Aries. Did come v 2 working group for December the twelfth

54
00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.269
Lance Byrd: 2022 good to have everybody.

55
00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:10.180
Lance Byrd: we'll go through some updates here.

56
00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:14.220
Lance Byrd: I just created the page. So yeah, we'll just

57
00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:25.350
Lance Byrd: we just edit it as we go feel free to. Well, I should remind everybody about the antitrust policy for Hyper Ledger and the code of conduct for Hyper ledger.

58
00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:29.429
Lance Byrd: please. if you'd like to add yourself to the attendees list.

Lance Byrd: for today's meeting.

60
00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.610
Lance Byrd: I think. Yep.

61
00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:42.280
Lance Byrd: I left some from last week that are here. And

62
00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:44.590
Lance Byrd: Yup, that's the 4 of us. Good.

63
00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:53.359
Lance Byrd: Okay. So I let's see on my end just doing updates real quick. We'll go around

64
00:05:53.510 --> 00:06:03.250
Lance Byrd: and actually, maybe Bruce, Would you like to introduce yourself? I think maybe everybody knows you. But yeah, maybe

65
00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:06.750
Bruce Conrad: maybe go for it. Thank you. Thank you, Lance.

66
00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:11.869
Bruce Conrad: I'm. I don't I if I've met a rhodo and he

67
00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:19.320
Bruce Conrad: I work at Brigham Young University in Provo Utah

68
00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:22.650
Bruce Conrad: and i'm my interest in this

69
00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:27.029
Bruce Conrad: working group is that I'm. Assisting Phil Windley, who has

70
00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:30.730
Bruce Conrad: 3 students implementing. Then Con B. 2

71
00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:34.200
Bruce Conrad: using his pico system

72
00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:44.690
Hakan: so quick, quick, quick question on that. is it being implemented on some areas framework or or another yeah.

73
00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:46.760
Hakan: or another software

74
00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:52.220
Bruce Conrad: it's it's another software Phil Wendy invented

75
00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:54.590
Bruce Conrad: something he calls Picos.

76
00:06:55.130 --> 00:07:02.949
Bruce Conrad: Yes, which are supported by a pico engine implemented in Node Js.

77
00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:08.080
Bruce Conrad: And the students are using the rust library of

78
00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:11.510
Bruce Conrad: to

79
00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:14.509
Bruce Conrad: Bring that up in the pico world.

80
00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:17.620
Rodolfo Miranda: I IoT device it right.

81
00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:27.850
Bruce Conrad: yeah, picos are came out of the IoT world, but they're

82
00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:30.380
Bruce Conrad: They They have broader usage than that

83
00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:33.630
Bruce Conrad: they can be used to implement websites

84
00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:35.740
Bruce Conrad: and

85
00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:38.020
and

86
00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:40.809
Bruce Conrad: each each people can be an agent

87
00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:46.719
Bruce Conrad: we already have Aries agents running did come V one

88
00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:55.499
Bruce Conrad: up up to and including making connections and exchanging basic messages.

89
00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:01.620
Rodolfo Miranda: Hmm. Great.

90
00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:04.160
Rodolfo Miranda: Yeah. I always miss the

91
00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:15.389
Rodolfo Miranda: the sessions on the Iw. Regarding the the picos or something. Yeah, there's there's way too much going on that I double. Yeah.

92
00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:24.530
Lance Byrd: all right. Great? Yeah. Glad to have you, Bruce. And it was cool to meet you at Iw. And yeah.

93
00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:25.780
Lance Byrd: Very good.

94
00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:27.650
Lance Byrd: Okay.

95
00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:41.849
Lance Byrd: Let's see updates on my end. I don't think I did much for specifically for this group over the last week. I did read through the document that

96
00:08:41.929 --> 00:08:44.060
Lance Byrd: that hackon had shared.

97
00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:46.200
Lance Byrd: let's see. We have it here.

98
00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:54.959
Rodolfo Miranda: is the last there's a ha can be from some

99
00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:57.679
Rodolfo Miranda: that may be interesting to to

100
00:08:57.830 --> 00:09:08.940
Lance Byrd: to review today. Yes, good point right. So that is was one of the nice things from this past week. the

101
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.830
Lance Byrd: the

102
00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:17.199
Lance Byrd: The aip. 3 movement is alive and well.

103
00:09:18.250 --> 00:09:26.030
Lance Byrd: let me. I'm just going to search for the the links that I had for that.

104
00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:36.349
Lance Byrd: but yeah, it it it seems like a IP 3 is is going to be a real thing. It's going to be did come be too focused.

105
00:09:36.390 --> 00:09:47.929
Lance Byrd: and yeah, I I would say that that's maybe the most important thing that happened over the last week. But yeah, you guys go ahead and fill in some details, and i'll find some links.

106
00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:54.379
Rodolfo Miranda: I I

107
00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:57.430
Hakan: Oh, this is great. This is from San Current.

108
00:09:57.610 --> 00:09:58.380
Okay.

109
00:09:58.710 --> 00:10:09.870
Rodolfo Miranda: yeah, yeah. On the last meeting eighties meeting last week. he raised that topic. So he on the meeting. He open up this.

110
00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:12.209
Rodolfo Miranda: the document, and I

111
00:10:12.510 --> 00:10:13.900
Rodolfo Miranda: on the fly.

112
00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:20.260
Rodolfo Miranda: So but it but it's something that we need to be completed. It's just what the the

113
00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:22.859
Rodolfo Miranda: keep feeling on the during the meeting.

114
00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:36.830
Lance Byrd: Yeah, this was really cool. it's so great to have Sam helping with the effort. and yeah, he basically what we kind of discussed was that

115
00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:50.209
Lance Byrd: I was concerned. That okay, aip one was was, you know, had had it's it's scope. And then maybe aip 2 that that that scope expanded and I was worried.

116
00:10:50.220 --> 00:11:07.949
Lance Byrd: are we at a point where a aip, 3.0 might be? just too large to be kind of a as-wide interrupt profile. maybe you know, I suggested. maybe we should call it like a IP. did come V 2 even though personally

117
00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:27.619
Lance Byrd: I would love to see Aip 3.0. B. You know that did come V 2 interrupt profile. And and basically Sam and and others base, basically noted. Well, maybe the scope of the IP actually shrinks by making it did come v 2 specific and and

118
00:11:27.650 --> 00:11:45.029
Lance Byrd: it seems that the momentum in in the other agents you know the the work that hockey and his group's doing for occupy. And the pull request that's going through for Afgh right now going through review, and and that the sick pole guys

119
00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:48.610
Lance Byrd: are working on actively.

120
00:11:49.410 --> 00:12:01.429
Lance Byrd: that it seems to be enough momentum across Aries that yeah Ap. 3. What they did come V. 2 focus would would would be quite beneficial to the community. So

121
00:12:01.810 --> 00:12:08.470
Lance Byrd: that was a really great talk. And basically Sam started to produce this table.

122
00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:28.060
Lance Byrd: in order to basically show how did come V. 2 spec begins to replace a bunch of the Rfcs from previous interrupt profiles. And thus, you know, maybe the list is not, as ex not as large as as I would feared.

123
00:12:28.090 --> 00:12:30.690
Lance Byrd: So any thoughts

124
00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:37.749
Rodolfo Miranda: he actually remove it. Start it, copy past the IP 2, and start removing roles.

125
00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:42.670
Rodolfo Miranda: and that's how it does. And the the other main point here is that

126
00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:47.330
Rodolfo Miranda: even in also in in a IP 2 there are some

127
00:12:47.610 --> 00:12:53.870
Rodolfo Miranda: a that are optional, so like the mediator, and and that some on the on the bottom.

128
00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:58.539
Rodolfo Miranda: So we we can do the same like. Put everything as a optional.

129
00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:08.079
Rodolfo Miranda: so you you can comply with the IP 3, but not with with some only in in some part, maybe the main part.

130
00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:12.110
Rodolfo Miranda: But if you are a mediator, you can comply also with the mediator part.

131
00:13:14.070 --> 00:13:19.159
Lance Byrd: Yeah. And I love that. What what do you guys think about having kind of this this optional list

132
00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:24.960
Lance Byrd: that people can can borrow from depending on. you know their requirements.

133
00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:31.660
Hakan: Sorry I was commenting right now. What what do you mean with the optional list.

134
00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:35.080
Lance Byrd: You know we're basic.

135
00:13:35.090 --> 00:14:00.619
Lance Byrd: I think the concept is instead of making it seem that. Oh, you know, if you want to be a IP 3 compliant. you know, here is the the super list, right of everything you could implement right. One of my one of the lessons learned, it seems to me, from the Jff. exercise was that when people start start jumping into did Com. V. 2

136
00:14:00.630 --> 00:14:13.299
Lance Byrd: it can be pretty overwhelming to know. What is it that I absolutely have to implement? And what can we kind of work towards over time? Granted. You know, there it's a spec, and you know we all want to fully comply with the spec. But

137
00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:31.140
Lance Byrd: you know there's some kind of minimal things that you could put. And so Sam was pointing out that even maybe an aip 2, they had a a concept of some optional pieces and so maybe you don't want to implement mediation

138
00:14:31.150 --> 00:14:42.650
Lance Byrd: right off the back, because maybe you're not doing mobile you know development, and and you don't need a mediator. But you know eventually you would would want to adopt that. So

139
00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:57.259
Lance Byrd: I think the concept was. Let's try to make a list. That's kind of you know the core things that that probably everybody is going to need, and then have some optional things that people can pick and choose from. For instance, if they want Indie Base credentials.

140
00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:08.349
Rodolfo Miranda: Yeah, and those those we already on aip 2. So but I but I didn't know that was like optional, so, and they they could like this man with maybe it in the credit.

141
00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:15.010
Rodolfo Miranda: and that is optional. So that was something new for me, too. So it's good.

142
00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:19.149
Lance Byrd: Yeah, I like it. Other thoughts.

143
00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:31.090
Rodolfo Miranda: I'm sorry it's. It's very important to to our project, because it's a very short term project.

144
00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:34.660
Bruce Conrad: and we're not even going to get all of the base requirements done.

145
00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:36.450
Lance Byrd: Yeah.

146
00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:41.359
Lance Byrd: yeah, that's and that that yeah, again, the the Jf thing

147
00:15:41.490 --> 00:15:58.699
Lance Byrd: you know, it was this exercise, and you know they get funding, and you know. So okay, a bunch of people jumped in. and yeah, same thing. It it's supposed to be the short term turnaround of okay, let's show the the this cordial exchange.

148
00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:01.809
Lance Byrd: What's it called? Open badge or something like that

149
00:16:01.830 --> 00:16:09.259
Lance Byrd: credential exchange. And yeah, they they have a limited amount of time, little limited amount of resources. And so you

150
00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:19.060
Lance Byrd: they're not going to be able to implement everything for did come v 2, and they kind of went through Wacky and Wacky Didcom for for credential exchange, and they basically

151
00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:25.570
Lance Byrd: even that they they chose a subset to to implement between themselves so that they could.

152
00:16:25.650 --> 00:16:33.400
Lance Byrd: you know, show trading these credentials or or transferring these credentials to one another. So

153
00:16:34.250 --> 00:16:40.189
Lance Byrd: I think that concept should be very important, and i'd love to kind of capture.

154
00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:40.930
Hmm

155
00:16:40.950 --> 00:16:47.009
Lance Byrd: kind of the core path of of a did come V. 2 implementation of verse

156
00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:54.239
Lance Byrd: kind of all the other things that a a person might support or did come the to implementation might support.

157
00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:56.930
Bruce Conrad: Yes, that sounds very, very interesting.

158
00:16:57.180 --> 00:17:05.570
Bruce Conrad: Can you? provide the link to the Jf. Work of some kind.

159
00:17:05.890 --> 00:17:15.359
Lance Byrd: this this spreadsheet that that i'm trying to build. I have a references, tab, and so I put the Jf. Notes here. There's a link to that.

160
00:17:15.410 --> 00:17:24.560
Lance Byrd: i'll. I'll thank you very much. I I have that. okay, Good. Yeah, great. And yeah.

161
00:17:24.569 --> 00:17:44.410
Lance Byrd: I guess my my disclaimer again, for the spreadsheet is, i'm trying to build it to to help the community. But we can document things. However, we want. I would just like there to be a place that's useful for us to kind of collect this information as we go so we have, you know, a list of implementations, a list of did methods

162
00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:51.789
Lance Byrd: that that are essentially supported by those implementations. And you know, probably you want to support did peer right. But

163
00:17:51.810 --> 00:17:57.400
Lance Byrd: these kinds of things to help interrupt between all these new

164
00:17:57.440 --> 00:18:00.640
Lance Byrd: users essentially of Didcom V. 2

165
00:18:02.450 --> 00:18:09.880
Rodolfo Miranda: So yeah, I'm always open.

166
00:18:09.910 --> 00:18:20.350
Rodolfo Miranda: removing this some protocols, and and they start removing the protocols that are already inside the this. It can be to a specification like the out of one.

167
00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:37.750
Rodolfo Miranda: I think the the trust being the routine protocol on the discover feature. So, though those 4 were removed from the list, but our only because they are on the expect that it's the first role.

168
00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:40.989
Rodolfo Miranda: So I think, in the out. We need to put that the the

169
00:18:41.290 --> 00:18:45.110
Rodolfo Miranda: this is back also includes include those those protocols.

170
00:18:45.290 --> 00:18:51.419
Rodolfo Miranda: Yeah, the the other one really important for hard time, and that is something that we need to Really.

171
00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:59.189
Rodolfo Miranda: They will talk about this. He removed them. I think they they did a change protocol.

172
00:18:59.430 --> 00:19:02.489
Rodolfo Miranda: because some say, okay, this is not actually

173
00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:05.999
Rodolfo Miranda: we need it in the of a IP.

174
00:19:06.430 --> 00:19:11.249
Rodolfo Miranda: because it's more internal on each framework. I think

175
00:19:11.620 --> 00:19:15.829
Rodolfo Miranda: so. But anyway, we we and and the other

176
00:19:15.870 --> 00:19:23.170
Rodolfo Miranda: thing that is, some mention is we are we to? Maybe we should write an like an Rfp.

177
00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:31.530
Rodolfo Miranda: It's not gonna be like a protocol, but more kind of a like a reference, or over the cushion on how we should implement

178
00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:36.930
Rodolfo Miranda: those kind of stuff like you, you you always.

179
00:19:37.130 --> 00:19:41.530
Rodolfo Miranda: I was talking about the connection right how you establish a connection.

180
00:19:41.650 --> 00:19:44.440
Rodolfo Miranda: and even though did it come to

181
00:19:45.490 --> 00:19:48.109
Rodolfo Miranda: kind of start the connection with such a simple

182
00:19:48.330 --> 00:19:49.380
Rodolfo Miranda: message

183
00:19:49.810 --> 00:19:55.110
Rodolfo Miranda: by receiving a simple message on the framework? You need to handle that right?

184
00:19:55.330 --> 00:19:58.749
Rodolfo Miranda: And this is something that we need to agree on. How

185
00:19:58.950 --> 00:20:00.059
Rodolfo Miranda: should be done.

186
00:20:03.490 --> 00:20:06.749
Lance Byrd: and so do we see that

187
00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:08.970
Lance Byrd: as part of the

188
00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:19.559
Lance Byrd: Rfc. For they come v one, and they come v 2. The transition from did come be one to did come v 2, or do you see that as

189
00:20:20.350 --> 00:20:25.179
Rodolfo Miranda: maybe not not for the transitions like a a general way of

190
00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:28.080
Rodolfo Miranda: yeah. How should a connection?

191
00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:31.010
Rodolfo Miranda: How to? We establish right?

192
00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:36.939
Rodolfo Miranda: Just we see the message, and that's a connection or not. Yes, we need something extra

193
00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:39.679
Rodolfo Miranda: like replying to that message on.

194
00:20:39.870 --> 00:20:44.529
Rodolfo Miranda: and that's the end of the establishing a connection that that's the thing, I think.

195
00:20:44.890 --> 00:20:50.360
Rodolfo Miranda: if need to, to. We we saw because they they did this change. We saw that right

196
00:20:50.610 --> 00:20:52.939
Rodolfo Miranda: and that way. It's not so clear

197
00:20:53.550 --> 00:20:54.960
Rodolfo Miranda: I we should probably.

198
00:20:55.210 --> 00:20:58.689
Alex: Hey, guys Sorry I Gen: Late a little bit

199
00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:04.129
Alex: yeah. I was stuck on my code, and I forgot about the meeting. but I guess like

200
00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:09.289
Alex: I guess, Rodo, you said that we should try to figure out a way to generalize connection.

201
00:21:09.810 --> 00:21:10.630
Alex: I

202
00:21:10.730 --> 00:21:14.310
Alex: I don't think we should try to do it at the group level.

203
00:21:14.350 --> 00:21:19.099
Alex: in my opinion, like that kind of depends on like a message per message level

204
00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:26.840
Alex: from that perspective, and I think that, like each like Wallet implementer, should try to figure out a way of like how to

205
00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:29.330
Alex: for handle messages.

206
00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:31.819
Alex: I had like a message at handler class

207
00:21:31.870 --> 00:21:35.579
Alex: since they come to to me, since more like it's a

208
00:21:36.250 --> 00:21:37.050
Alex: one way

209
00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:40.429
Alex: protocol like it's it doesn't like really support it

210
00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:41.870
Alex: like sessions.

211
00:21:41.940 --> 00:21:45.000
Alex: I mean, it does have the concept of thread so like you can kind of like use

212
00:21:45.230 --> 00:21:49.090
Alex: a thread. Id as like a connection Id concept

213
00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:51.429
Alex: but yeah, like.

214
00:21:52.410 --> 00:21:54.780
Alex: do you guys think this is like a good like?

215
00:21:54.860 --> 00:21:59.010
Alex: I mean, I agree that everybody is going to have to use the concept of connections. I'm not sure

216
00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:00.999
Alex: we should standardize it

217
00:22:01.690 --> 00:22:04.239
Alex: outside of thecom, I guess.

218
00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:06.640
Yeah.

219
00:22:06.810 --> 00:22:07.690
Alex: What do you think

220
00:22:17.540 --> 00:22:32.829
Rodolfo Miranda: don't know? Jump on? No, yeah, yeah. I I I agree. Don't misunderstand the eyes, but maybe a reference, because it's an in this issue, and somehow I agree on on, because if you receive a message.

221
00:22:33.220 --> 00:22:38.690
Rodolfo Miranda: you're okay. You You can now establish a connection. But the other part is still not because

222
00:22:39.210 --> 00:22:57.310
Alex: yeah, that yeah, no, you're the other part to right? Right? Right? Right. The party. You know that you received the message right? Correct, like like the your part doesn't even know that, like whether you read the message or not, so I think the like, I think, did come itself, is designed in such a way that it's purposely done that way

223
00:22:57.370 --> 00:22:59.890
Alex: to not have like a pair wise

224
00:23:02.710 --> 00:23:05.969
Alex: like a fair West connection. But yeah, I mean like.

225
00:23:06.150 --> 00:23:12.749
Alex: So I guess i'm trying to figure out. What are we trying to do with Aip 3? And to me it sounds like we're trying to figure out like a basic set of protocols

226
00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:17.009
Alex: that allows to have some minimum communication between

227
00:23:17.390 --> 00:23:22.250
Alex: to did come agents. and I guess since it doesn't.

228
00:23:22.450 --> 00:23:27.689
Alex: I have to do much with areas like in my mind they make sense to call like a basic. They come profile.

229
00:23:27.930 --> 00:23:29.859
Alex: but yeah.

230
00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:36.089
Alex: I think I think I guess from the perspective it does make sense to standardize connections.

231
00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:39.150
Alex: If we look at it that way. So okay, yeah.

232
00:23:41.020 --> 00:23:44.919
Rodolfo Miranda: But but I know that Hong Kong was working really hard on that. One day

233
00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:47.470
Rodolfo Miranda: on the I got by, so

234
00:23:47.810 --> 00:23:54.629
Alex: I guess, like I'm saying like the way I can, I will handle connections will be slightly different than a. Of J.

235
00:23:54.660 --> 00:23:55.880
Alex: Where no connection

236
00:23:56.250 --> 00:23:59.050
Alex: or do they handle connection the same way right now.

237
00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:08.199
Rodolfo Miranda: but that doesn't matter how how they can, but how how it they flow will work, maybe to to

238
00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:11.140
Rodolfo Miranda: to acknowledge the connection somehow.

239
00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:12.990
I see

240
00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:19.289
Rodolfo Miranda: if you send a message, you you, because maybe you send a message to to another one

241
00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:27.340
Rodolfo Miranda: from one out of one. And then you need to. We see that we played back to make sure that the okay, both both parties now are talking.

242
00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:28.480
Rodolfo Miranda: We have it.

243
00:24:28.530 --> 00:24:30.020
Rodolfo Miranda: Yeah, an agreed connection

244
00:24:30.110 --> 00:24:30.700
me, too.

245
00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:33.259
Rodolfo Miranda: You You may or may not mean that. But

246
00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:34.949
anyway, I think that's

247
00:24:35.370 --> 00:24:43.949
Alex: yeah, like established like a handshake like, okay, hey? I'm: I have this. Yeah, I think, like we need to figure out like the like a connection and

248
00:24:44.030 --> 00:24:44.810
pretty cool.

249
00:24:46.300 --> 00:24:46.960
Hakan: Yeah.

250
00:24:49.430 --> 00:24:51.759
Hakan: I think there were. I'm: sorry.

251
00:24:54.510 --> 00:24:55.790
Lance Byrd: Yeah, go ahead, Hawk.

252
00:24:55.860 --> 00:25:11.770
Hakan: No, yeah. I I totally agree with the handshake protocol, because this is, I think, mentioned in did come as well it could be like an out of pens, or like a did exchange, I think, in terms of handshake proc for Aries frameworks at least.

253
00:25:19.750 --> 00:25:25.809
Alex: Yeah, Exactly. I think we should figure out a way like agent like discovered themselves like between one another and like I think that's

254
00:25:26.420 --> 00:25:27.920
Alex: the protocol I created.

255
00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:33.639
Alex: That's that's what i'm thinking as well.

256
00:25:36.730 --> 00:25:45.459
Rodolfo Miranda: and that can be an Rfp. And you Rfp: because we have this change, for this can be one, and that can be really really simple. Or this comes with you.

257
00:25:50.940 --> 00:26:08.359
Lance Byrd: Okay, interesting. Alex. Just so you're we're codified. I'm: Sorry, Bruce, that's that is in here he is. working with students. in Utah who are doing like a minimal implementation

258
00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:13.969
Lance Byrd: of did com V. 2. They have a, you know, a very fairly narrow window

259
00:26:14.020 --> 00:26:30.979
Lance Byrd: to work on it. And I told him that that has a similarities to kind of the Jf. stuff that that you have been working on with Brian and others. and so he's he's got the link to the Jff document that you guys have

260
00:26:30.990 --> 00:26:47.490
Lance Byrd: but I still think maybe the transfer of information between his group and your group. for how to, kinda, you know. Get up and running. I I I would just love for that to be reflected somewhere.

261
00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:51.230
Lance Byrd: so yeah, just

262
00:26:51.440 --> 00:27:09.000
Lance Byrd: the the kind of pain points that you guys went through, or you know what's the the the quickest path to to, you know, transferring credentials and inspired by Wacky, but maybe not fully implementing wacky and not fully implementing, did convey to. So I just wanted to make you aware of his work, and

263
00:27:09.010 --> 00:27:12.220
Lance Byrd: I think I think you guys can benefit from each other. Maybe.

264
00:27:13.940 --> 00:27:15.239
Alex: Hi, Bruce! Nice to meet you.

265
00:27:17.020 --> 00:27:20.220
Bruce Conrad: Nice to meet you, Alex. Yes, that would be. That would be great.

266
00:27:20.310 --> 00:27:27.610
Bruce Conrad: In fact, our students are even going to go so far as exchanging verify verifiable credentials.

267
00:27:27.820 --> 00:27:30.999
Bruce Conrad: Their work will be done when they've managed to connect

268
00:27:31.340 --> 00:27:33.650
Bruce Conrad: 2 picos using did Comb V 2.

269
00:27:35.250 --> 00:27:37.329
Alex: Okay, Got it? So okay.

270
00:27:37.430 --> 00:27:41.049
Alex: So you guys trying to implement your own like the come libraries from scratch

271
00:27:41.590 --> 00:27:45.300
Bruce Conrad: starting with sick for the for the crypto.

272
00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:56.549
Rodolfo Miranda: I I I I think that I think they pickco is gonna be they. They're gonna have a like a an endpoint, or they're gonna need a mediator.

273
00:27:59.220 --> 00:28:03.649
Bruce Conrad: each. Each each pica will be will be an agent with endpoint.

274
00:28:04.430 --> 00:28:19.509
Rodolfo Miranda: Okay, Good. Maybe that that's gonna be in a close, like in a private network, or just a live on on the work. Yes, every pico when it's created is there's a cloud agent.

275
00:28:20.390 --> 00:28:21.400
Rodolfo Miranda: Okay, Good.

276
00:28:26.990 --> 00:28:29.840
Alex: Yeah, definitely. That's a that's a sometime, and we can chat.

277
00:28:30.620 --> 00:28:32.040
Bruce Conrad: Yeah, that would be great.

278
00:28:36.750 --> 00:28:41.080
Bruce Conrad: if you would send me an email to get started, Alex. That would be

279
00:28:41.770 --> 00:28:42.750
Bruce Conrad: fabulous.

280
00:28:44.230 --> 00:28:51.810
Alex: can you show me your email? Can you text me your email? And then I can email you back

281
00:28:52.220 --> 00:28:54.230
Bruce Conrad: it's in the meeting notes at the top.

282
00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:59.139
Alex: Oh, got it? I don't know. Yeah, I'll I'll get it from the from there.

283
00:28:59.200 --> 00:28:59.790
Alex: I think.

284
00:29:00.140 --> 00:29:01.540
Bruce Conrad: Okay, thanks. That works

285
00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:15.110
Lance Byrd: okay. Very good benefit from.

286
00:29:20.010 --> 00:29:26.310
Bruce Conrad: Okay, so so Lance given given their goal. I think that would be interesting if

287
00:29:26.790 --> 00:29:31.669
Bruce Conrad: if the aip 3 was even further subdivided.

288
00:29:32.030 --> 00:29:33.700
Bruce Conrad: in the

289
00:29:34.150 --> 00:29:36.759
Bruce Conrad: in the overall diagram for

290
00:29:37.140 --> 00:29:38.360
Bruce Conrad: sovereign identity.

291
00:29:38.510 --> 00:29:41.540
Bruce Conrad: The the layer diagram that has

292
00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:46.439
Bruce Conrad: verifiable data repositories at the at level, one

293
00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:50.020
Bruce Conrad: and agents connecting at level 2

294
00:29:50.390 --> 00:29:55.570
Bruce Conrad: credential issuance and proof concepts at Level 3 and governance at level 4

295
00:29:56.480 --> 00:29:58.249
Bruce Conrad: and

296
00:29:58.330 --> 00:30:02.079
Bruce Conrad: so part of being an Aries agent is being able to connect

297
00:30:02.620 --> 00:30:04.780
Bruce Conrad: and send messages.

298
00:30:04.850 --> 00:30:08.840
Bruce Conrad: you know, starting with basic message, and then custom protocols.

299
00:30:09.310 --> 00:30:14.820
Bruce Conrad: and that's level. 2 of the diagram I referred to. Sorry I couldn't find that I looked for it.

300
00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:16.960
Bruce Conrad: and

301
00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:22.210
Bruce Conrad: issuing credentials and proof requests, and so forth. Our level 2. Yeah, that's the one

302
00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:29.649
Bruce Conrad: layer 3. So I think it would be interesting if a IP 3 had a part that same for layer 2

303
00:30:29.670 --> 00:30:31.459
Bruce Conrad: this is what you need

304
00:30:31.550 --> 00:30:32.430
Bruce Conrad: to have.

305
00:30:32.580 --> 00:30:37.300
Bruce Conrad: and for later 3 you need to add on these things.

306
00:30:37.580 --> 00:30:40.160
Lance Byrd: Yes, interesting. And I think

307
00:30:40.490 --> 00:30:42.759
Lance Byrd: haven't I seen recently. A.

308
00:30:43.030 --> 00:30:45.380
Lance Byrd: Maybe it was a. Did come v 2

309
00:30:45.950 --> 00:30:48.170
Lance Byrd: break down

310
00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:53.939
Lance Byrd: of this technology stack. But with did come V. 2.

311
00:30:55.970 --> 00:31:00.790
Lance Byrd: Does anybody remember that? I feel like in the last? I'll say 3 weeks, maybe month.

312
00:31:01.090 --> 00:31:02.939
Lance Byrd: and maybe it was like a W.

313
00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:06.089
Alex: Yeah, I think German Reid. He has a

314
00:31:06.210 --> 00:31:09.750
Alex: It has like a like an image where you have layer 2,

315
00:31:09.820 --> 00:31:13.330
Alex: they come and layer 3. You have like discount protocols.

316
00:31:13.740 --> 00:31:19.889
Alex: Yes, you're right. That was the only difference that that that's kind of like where they come up

317
00:31:20.490 --> 00:31:25.919
Alex: it goes to. And then he was comparing that to like. Oh, I DC. It's also like a layer 3 protocol.

318
00:31:26.170 --> 00:31:30.620
Alex: for, like exchanging credentials.

319
00:31:30.890 --> 00:31:33.180
Bruce Conrad: Was that an Iw session

320
00:31:33.300 --> 00:31:42.239
Bruce Conrad: that I missed? I missed most of them. Yeah, isn't isn't that the the torture of it.

321
00:31:42.470 --> 00:31:46.250
Lance Byrd: okay, I will

322
00:31:46.340 --> 00:31:48.720
Lance Byrd: try to hunt that down.

323
00:31:49.890 --> 00:31:51.020
Lance Byrd: Hmm.

324
00:31:51.300 --> 00:31:55.719
Lance Byrd: Yes, give me a moment and yeah, I guess feel free to.

325
00:31:57.130 --> 00:32:00.760
Lance Byrd: Well, what else do we want to talk about? I I guess. Let's let's

326
00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:05.080
Lance Byrd: a

327
00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:06.640
Lance Byrd: do

328
00:32:06.790 --> 00:32:10.049
Lance Byrd: we? Yeah, how did we get to?

329
00:32:11.530 --> 00:32:15.319
Lance Byrd: Let's see? Yeah, we introduced to Bruce to

330
00:32:15.790 --> 00:32:20.310
Lance Byrd: Alex. Before that we were talking about hackon's work?

331
00:32:20.570 --> 00:32:23.219
Lance Byrd: Yes, and with connections right?

332
00:32:23.770 --> 00:32:29.320
Rodolfo Miranda: we're getting that done least once. What i'm gonna do is like

333
00:32:29.630 --> 00:32:32.860
Rodolfo Miranda: this list here. updating. Yeah, then

334
00:32:33.260 --> 00:32:42.399
Rodolfo Miranda: the protocols to the some to the bars on 3 like they issue credentials that they walk. You may be moving to bathroom 3.

335
00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:45.239
Rodolfo Miranda: I'm going to review the go.

336
00:32:45.540 --> 00:32:46.720
Rodolfo Miranda: What code?

337
00:32:47.370 --> 00:32:49.390
Rodolfo Miranda: least acknowledged.

338
00:32:49.890 --> 00:32:55.470
Rodolfo Miranda: Yeah. Some like like simple updating to to the latest protocols.

339
00:32:55.520 --> 00:33:01.129
Rodolfo Miranda: and maybe that also for the mediator. the one on the on the bottom.

340
00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:04.050
Rodolfo Miranda: I'm going to have the the latest. Yeah.

341
00:33:04.220 --> 00:33:07.530
Rodolfo Miranda: And then we probably should work on on this

342
00:33:07.660 --> 00:33:12.789
Rodolfo Miranda: connection, reference or whatever.

343
00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:22.420
Lance Byrd: Yeah, that is, everybody. Are we able to? What do we have here? There's notes here.

344
00:33:23.670 --> 00:33:27.909
Lance Byrd: but this is okay. This is fairly recent. I haven't gone through these notes.

345
00:33:28.100 --> 00:33:33.880
Lance Byrd: so it looks like at the very least people are able to post.

346
00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:35.420
Oh, that's good.

347
00:33:35.910 --> 00:33:42.260
Hakan: Yeah, you can comment on it's basically with, choose wherever you want to do it and make your right click.

348
00:33:42.860 --> 00:33:44.749
Rodolfo Miranda: Hmm. That's good. Good.

349
00:33:46.770 --> 00:33:47.810
Lance Byrd: Okay.

350
00:33:50.030 --> 00:33:53.850
Lance Byrd: right? So we kind of talked about

351
00:33:55.590 --> 00:33:57.190
Lance Byrd: this.

352
00:33:57.280 --> 00:33:57.960
Hakan: Yeah.

353
00:33:57.990 --> 00:34:12.310
Hakan: right? But I still keep it there to put it at least as a note with the Rfc. As mentioned, because these are Rfcs that are already there on the areas. And since this is like kind of an area into a purpose of profile. 3 point. Oh, I think it's worth mentioning.

354
00:34:12.460 --> 00:34:13.290
Lance Byrd: Right?

355
00:34:13.389 --> 00:34:15.159
Lance Byrd: Okay? Great.

356
00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:18.630
Lance Byrd: Everybody agrees with that. Yes.

357
00:34:20.610 --> 00:34:21.609
yes.

358
00:34:30.020 --> 00:34:31.359
Lance Byrd: yeah, good.

359
00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:33.119
Lance Byrd: All right. Cool

360
00:34:33.830 --> 00:34:38.950
Lance Byrd: let's see something you mentioned there. Roto

361
00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:42.729
Lance Byrd: regarding the goal. Codes

362
00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:45.789
Lance Byrd: right. We talked about

363
00:34:46.909 --> 00:34:58.769
Lance Byrd: right discovery protocol. I think we discussed this last week a little bit a, and I cash. I meant to this week do some this past week, do some research to

364
00:34:59.710 --> 00:35:05.260
Lance Byrd: better understand ways that did come. V. 2 agents can

365
00:35:05.830 --> 00:35:10.520
Lance Byrd: discover more about each other than just their application Protocols.

366
00:35:10.700 --> 00:35:17.930
Lance Byrd: this concept that you know. Okay, if you're not going to implement every part of Didcom.

367
00:35:18.470 --> 00:35:20.919
Lance Byrd: How do you tell

368
00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:37.680
Lance Byrd: another agent that? Well, these are the parts of did come that that I've implemented? These are the did methods that I support. These are the, you know. Maybe maybe there's some kind of crypto negotiations that you can do. but kind of how do you do that right? Because.

369
00:35:37.850 --> 00:35:45.679
Lance Byrd: you know, at some point you get to the point where you know. How do you even message each other at all, or or trade information at all.

370
00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:54.270
Lance Byrd: so yeah, that that's super fuzzy for me. If anybody spend any time thinking about that, i'd love to hear ideas.

371
00:35:55.930 --> 00:35:59.000
Lance Byrd: but that's something that I I I still would like to.

372
00:35:59.330 --> 00:36:04.890
Lance Byrd: Eventually you have a have a good breakdown of, and and maybe using

373
00:36:05.540 --> 00:36:08.039
Lance Byrd: the trust over IP model

374
00:36:09.080 --> 00:36:19.530
Lance Byrd: to kind of highlight what can be discovered, or maybe even you know, what are the nuances? Because this is kind of what this spreadsheet

375
00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:22.909
Lance Byrd: supposed to be doing is showing you.

376
00:36:23.010 --> 00:36:41.360
Lance Byrd: you know. Here are the considerations we'll just call them considerations for now the layer. One considerations that you need to do did come, for instance, V. 2, the the layer, 2 considerations, the layer, 3 considerations. And then how you know, how does? How do 2 agents that that may not have implemented everything.

377
00:36:42.380 --> 00:36:43.120
Lance Byrd: you know.

378
00:36:43.860 --> 00:36:58.530
Lance Byrd: How did I, even? How do you discover? Why, you couldn't interrupt, but it I posted like the link to the discover feature protocol inside the the income. Oh, yes. So if you go there.

379
00:37:00.770 --> 00:37:02.800
Rodolfo Miranda: yeah, go go down a little bit.

380
00:37:03.510 --> 00:37:08.930
Rodolfo Miranda: and there's a message. Yeah. So here you see that the discovery is like a query.

381
00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:12.430
Rodolfo Miranda: and and you query by a feature type.

382
00:37:12.620 --> 00:37:16.130
Rodolfo Miranda: and you can provide it like a matching. Also, if you want.

383
00:37:16.240 --> 00:37:21.520
Rodolfo Miranda: So in this spec all, I think they only mentioned

384
00:37:21.820 --> 00:37:28.820
Rodolfo Miranda: feature, type, protocol on feature, tile goal on the type of mentioned. But you can. It's a sensible, so you can

385
00:37:28.860 --> 00:37:38.250
Rodolfo Miranda: include other feature type. As you're wrong, you can create one, maybe a feature tie, walkypex, or whatever. So for a credential form, although.

386
00:37:38.500 --> 00:37:44.770
Rodolfo Miranda: and and that's I think it's the way to to use the discount feature.

387
00:37:46.300 --> 00:37:49.739
Lance Byrd: and and Sam seem to agree with that as well.

388
00:37:50.040 --> 00:37:52.509
Lance Byrd: when

389
00:37:53.640 --> 00:37:54.899
Lance Byrd: maybe

390
00:37:55.140 --> 00:38:01.309
Lance Byrd: I i'm just trying to think of timing. At what point do we want to as a group kind of walk through this.

391
00:38:01.670 --> 00:38:10.560
Lance Byrd: you know. Read up on it, be aware of it, and then kind of walk through. You know what could be some an inch initial values that we'd put in here.

392
00:38:12.580 --> 00:38:16.549
Lance Byrd: that would be more helpful for 2 agents.

393
00:38:18.330 --> 00:38:25.909
Lance Byrd: to yeah. Essentially discover their ability to to have, you know, to complete. There did come

394
00:38:26.380 --> 00:38:27.759
Lance Byrd: of

395
00:38:27.850 --> 00:38:29.729
Lance Byrd: operations with one another.

396
00:38:33.180 --> 00:38:42.390
Lance Byrd: any thoughts on that, or also if if this seems like something way in the future that we you know, shouldn't really be tackling now i'm i'm fine with that as well.

397
00:38:46.330 --> 00:38:52.239
Rodolfo Miranda: I I don't know. But the the other way you were mentioned like the what he picks that you can.

398
00:38:52.270 --> 00:38:56.020
Rodolfo Miranda: The attachments can be in different formats like the

399
00:39:00.390 --> 00:39:01.700
Rodolfo Miranda: so I don't know if that's

400
00:39:02.020 --> 00:39:03.500
Rodolfo Miranda: can be something.

401
00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:04.459
Rodolfo Miranda: all of them.

402
00:39:04.830 --> 00:39:08.760
Lance Byrd: Yeah, maybe a good starting point.

403
00:39:09.290 --> 00:39:10.279
Lance Byrd: Okay.

404
00:39:10.530 --> 00:39:16.140
Bruce Conrad: I I don't know if this is of interest. But even earlier in Section 2.1,

405
00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:18.249
Bruce Conrad: the media types.

406
00:39:22.090 --> 00:39:27.719
Bruce Conrad: the the Pico engine went as a Web server, which is part of what it does

407
00:39:27.820 --> 00:39:30.119
Bruce Conrad: it doesn't currently.

408
00:39:30.590 --> 00:39:33.600
Bruce Conrad: except messages with any of those headers.

409
00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:40.789
Bruce Conrad: And so one of the first things the students will have to do is modify it so that it will accept it will at least accept a message

410
00:39:41.430 --> 00:39:42.970
Bruce Conrad: at all.

411
00:39:44.600 --> 00:39:51.260
Bruce Conrad: Okay, yeah, I I I think I think if we assume http as the transport.

412
00:39:51.450 --> 00:39:57.969
Bruce Conrad: I think Http includes queries for that kind of thing. But I don't know for sure.

413
00:39:58.560 --> 00:40:03.179
Bruce Conrad: so that might be an initial starting point. You have an endpoint

414
00:40:03.210 --> 00:40:05.880
Bruce Conrad: that purports to be in Aries agent. Well.

415
00:40:06.200 --> 00:40:09.100
Bruce Conrad: what what media types does it

416
00:40:09.160 --> 00:40:10.029
Bruce Conrad: support?

417
00:40:11.890 --> 00:40:21.439
Bruce Conrad: you said you, said Aries agent. But did did you mean did company to agent? Or

418
00:40:21.620 --> 00:40:23.359
Bruce Conrad: if it purports to be one

419
00:40:23.460 --> 00:40:28.590
Bruce Conrad: then the then you could send an Http request

420
00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:29.979
Bruce Conrad: asking.

421
00:40:30.070 --> 00:40:33.989
Bruce Conrad: Does it support any of these media types?

422
00:40:34.830 --> 00:40:40.060
Bruce Conrad: If it doesn't, then we can determine that it's not actually, it did come v 2 agent

423
00:40:41.710 --> 00:40:46.620
Bruce Conrad: And if it doesn't support them all, then we at least know where to where to begin probing.

424
00:40:46.710 --> 00:40:47.560
Lance Byrd: Yeah.

425
00:40:47.900 --> 00:40:48.470
yeah.

426
00:40:48.680 --> 00:40:59.730
Rodolfo Miranda: that the promise that they discovered. Feature is after you're ready.

427
00:41:01.230 --> 00:41:07.920
Rodolfo Miranda: That is true. So they they pick the pickle. He said it to receive the message, but not expecting that

428
00:41:07.970 --> 00:41:09.599
Rodolfo Miranda: type of

429
00:41:10.030 --> 00:41:11.049
Rodolfo Miranda: and

430
00:41:12.940 --> 00:41:17.709
Rodolfo Miranda: the the tip of the on the heather is if they receive the visa.

431
00:41:18.300 --> 00:41:19.810
Bruce Conrad: Yeah, the the

432
00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:25.270
Bruce Conrad: the the pico engine out of the box. just expects.

433
00:41:25.460 --> 00:41:28.670
Bruce Conrad: expects Http requests with a media type.

434
00:41:28.700 --> 00:41:31.100
Bruce Conrad: I think it includes a a. Json

435
00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:34.430
Bruce Conrad: so it's it's it's very general.

436
00:41:35.250 --> 00:41:39.919
Rodolfo Miranda: But if if we receive that it will fail, or will that accept the message?

437
00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:46.060
Bruce Conrad: currently the way it's written. If it receives a message with one of those media types, it just ignores it.

438
00:41:48.350 --> 00:41:55.790
Rodolfo Miranda: Okay, it's not the message. Okay. And so so that's the first thing the students will be doing will be to

439
00:41:58.160 --> 00:42:00.229
Bruce Conrad: The open open the

440
00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:04.639
Bruce Conrad: the Pico engine as the Http server to those media types.

441
00:42:05.830 --> 00:42:06.990
Rodolfo Miranda: Okay.

442
00:42:14.570 --> 00:42:22.429
Bruce Conrad: Yeah. In in the trust over IP tech stack, I assume. Did come V 2 enters in only on level 2

443
00:42:23.700 --> 00:42:27.070
Bruce Conrad: does it? Does it interact with the level one at all?

444
00:42:29.650 --> 00:42:36.699
Rodolfo Miranda: Not needed, maybe to be solved like a. Did that. The

445
00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:39.169
Bruce Conrad: okay Only for a good resolution.

446
00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:40.639
Rodolfo Miranda: I think so

447
00:42:41.290 --> 00:42:56.859
Lance Byrd: that makes sense. Yeah. And which is still a big deal right? I mean, even in the Jf. Stuff Alex. Was kind of like. Oh, you know, they're using a did web. And you know this other person was just trying to do a did key, and i'm doing a did peer right? I mean.

448
00:42:58.110 --> 00:42:58.850
Bruce Conrad: Yeah.

449
00:43:00.500 --> 00:43:03.330
Bruce Conrad: I see what you mean. Yeah, there's a lot going on there, too.

450
00:43:03.820 --> 00:43:18.499
Lance Byrd: I mean it would. It would almost be nice to just rank the did methods like you know, of the people out there, you know, if if you know, here's the did methods that are most used, or something like that. And here's the reasons why pros and cons. And

451
00:43:18.910 --> 00:43:20.569
Bruce Conrad: yeah, that would be very useful.

452
00:43:20.850 --> 00:43:21.649
Lance Byrd: Yeah.

453
00:43:22.460 --> 00:43:26.550
Lance Byrd: And yeah. So maybe I mean, maybe this is

454
00:43:26.910 --> 00:43:29.120
Lance Byrd: a better way to

455
00:43:29.470 --> 00:43:32.020
Lance Byrd: connect the community.

456
00:43:33.360 --> 00:43:39.560
Lance Byrd: I hadn't really been coming at it from from the Trust over by trust Trust over IP, you know, layers.

457
00:43:40.110 --> 00:43:42.819
Lance Byrd: But I yeah, I feel like maybe our work

458
00:43:43.190 --> 00:43:51.509
Lance Byrd: and documenting the pain points, and you know, most most use did methods and things like that. It's probably better in this kind of

459
00:43:51.650 --> 00:43:53.680
Lance Byrd: view. What what do you guys think?

460
00:43:57.170 --> 00:44:08.069
Bruce Conrad: I I think so. I I guess. Obviously our Our students are basically going to be just in layer to using using periods or even key dids.

461
00:44:08.220 --> 00:44:09.609
Lance Byrd: Yeah, fair enough.

462
00:44:10.150 --> 00:44:12.820
Bruce Conrad: and and they will be done when they've established

463
00:44:12.890 --> 00:44:14.069
Bruce Conrad: connections

464
00:44:14.440 --> 00:44:19.079
Bruce Conrad: at the at layer 2 between between

465
00:44:19.530 --> 00:44:21.319
Bruce Conrad: the P. Among picos.

466
00:44:23.100 --> 00:44:31.150
Bruce Conrad: It would be it would be nice if they had time to interoperate they did spend some time looking at the Aries test harness and didn't get very far.

467
00:44:31.530 --> 00:44:36.450
Bruce Conrad: But but there the tasks feel when they set them wasn't to interoperate with

468
00:44:36.600 --> 00:44:40.999
Bruce Conrad: agents of with a did con v. 2 of of any other kind

469
00:44:41.270 --> 00:44:43.019
Bruce Conrad: just among themselves.

470
00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:43.990
Lance Byrd: Yeah.

471
00:44:44.120 --> 00:44:45.689
Lance Byrd: yeah, that makes sense.

472
00:44:46.370 --> 00:44:49.089
Lance Byrd: and

473
00:44:51.740 --> 00:44:53.700
Lance Byrd: but well.

474
00:44:54.060 --> 00:44:56.919
Lance Byrd: yeah, I mean that that totally makes sense.

475
00:44:57.040 --> 00:44:58.239
Lance Byrd: and then

476
00:44:58.270 --> 00:45:05.950
Lance Byrd: because interoperability is a lot harder. Okay, Good.

477
00:45:08.540 --> 00:45:12.129
Lance Byrd: Okay, we've got about 15 min left.

478
00:45:13.700 --> 00:45:20.589
Lance Byrd: I I i'll definitely send a message to Drummond to track down

479
00:45:21.270 --> 00:45:24.090
Lance Byrd: his the start of his diagram.

480
00:45:30.080 --> 00:45:34.679
Rodolfo Miranda: Well on the on them, you know they they so it

481
00:45:34.750 --> 00:45:43.900
Rodolfo Miranda: working group release the final document of the architecture. I think that is part of that diagram, but it really

482
00:45:44.240 --> 00:45:48.229
Rodolfo Miranda: define all the all the details within each layer.

483
00:45:53.150 --> 00:45:59.000
Lance Byrd: Okay, but that didn't show did it. It wasn't in the context of did com V. 2 right

484
00:45:59.600 --> 00:46:06.650
Rodolfo Miranda: well the inside that the this reference they define.

485
00:46:06.910 --> 00:46:14.640
Rodolfo Miranda: or they they tell about, did convict you?

486
00:46:15.170 --> 00:46:18.049
Rodolfo Miranda: that's a reference. All I think they manage on it.

487
00:46:18.220 --> 00:46:20.320
Rodolfo Miranda: can we, or some

488
00:46:20.500 --> 00:46:23.199
Rodolfo Miranda: I see.

489
00:46:23.370 --> 00:46:24.450
Rodolfo Miranda: Come on.

490
00:46:24.820 --> 00:46:26.310
Rodolfo Miranda: Yeah.

491
00:46:27.020 --> 00:46:28.149
Lance Byrd: Gotcha.

492
00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:29.779
Lance Byrd: Okay.

493
00:46:30.260 --> 00:46:35.119
Lance Byrd: I will. Let's see. You're saying that's the trust over. IP:

494
00:46:37.260 --> 00:46:40.269
Lance Byrd: What do they call that the architecture? Stat? Or

495
00:46:40.870 --> 00:46:44.389
Rodolfo Miranda: Yeah, I think so. Architecture, stack

496
00:46:45.100 --> 00:46:47.020
Hakan: or reference model

497
00:46:47.820 --> 00:46:50.909
Hakan: reference, architecture. Some like that.

498
00:46:56.240 --> 00:47:01.300
Lance Byrd: Oh, maybe that's literally on that page that I was

499
00:47:01.660 --> 00:47:02.910
Lance Byrd: model

500
00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:04.990
Lance Byrd: started with a vision.

501
00:47:08.600 --> 00:47:10.169
Lance Byrd: My paper?

502
00:47:11.130 --> 00:47:15.520
Lance Byrd: No, maybe this other page here Technical architecture.

503
00:47:24.030 --> 00:47:27.710
Rodolfo Miranda: I got it. It's it's on the now. It's on on a

504
00:47:27.760 --> 00:47:29.740
Rodolfo Miranda: the link.

505
00:47:32.890 --> 00:47:36.330
Lance Byrd: You say, github you Man: the yeah, there we go.

506
00:47:39.770 --> 00:47:43.470
Rodolfo Miranda: this one. I don't know how it windows.

507
00:48:05.710 --> 00:48:10.060
Rodolfo Miranda: Yeah, but probably rendering somewhere. I don't know that would work.

508
00:48:22.910 --> 00:48:30.080
Lance Byrd: Okay, and it just links to this back. Well, okay, we'll find we'll find more stuff and

509
00:48:30.910 --> 00:48:32.770
Lance Byrd: try to

510
00:48:33.100 --> 00:48:34.250
Lance Byrd: connect

511
00:48:34.850 --> 00:48:39.079
Lance Byrd: just that point of view, since you know it's it's gaining a lot of momentum.

512
00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:44.039
Lance Byrd: all right. so that I I feel like that was a lot of

513
00:48:45.610 --> 00:48:47.500
Lance Byrd: good discussion.

514
00:48:47.660 --> 00:48:55.909
Lance Byrd: How can do? Do? Is there any kind of updates from your team and the work that you're doing? I I love to get back to that

515
00:48:56.060 --> 00:48:58.529
Lance Byrd: just because it's

516
00:48:59.030 --> 00:49:02.879
Lance Byrd: you know it's rooted in implementation.

517
00:49:03.850 --> 00:49:14.279
Hakan: So from the implementation point of view, Judith started working on out of pens Protocol message structure fitting for did Con V 2

518
00:49:14.430 --> 00:49:20.959
Hakan: Spec: basically that's to to establish connection and set a V 2 flag. And the connection Id

519
00:49:23.430 --> 00:49:27.069
Hakan: from the point of

520
00:49:27.510 --> 00:49:36.640
Hakan: Yeah, I guess some more discussion. Strategic discussions tomorrow with the Aka Park meeting, and then we're going to talk about a bit about

521
00:49:36.670 --> 00:49:47.600
Hakan: which encryption, envelope or message envelope library we want to use for a cup I like there is one there's just been already implemented for. Ask I wallet there's like a python library. There's a rust library

522
00:49:47.780 --> 00:49:54.750
Hakan: to see what the community at this Akapi community is thinking about using as libraries.

523
00:49:57.730 --> 00:50:03.220
Lance Byrd: libraries for encryption. You said, yeah. Libraries for message envelope. Okay?

524
00:50:07.560 --> 00:50:16.799
Lance Byrd: And you said, as far as our python implementation, I think it's from Daniel Haman.

525
00:50:17.420 --> 00:50:20.959
Hakan: or Rust's implementation. Okay.

526
00:50:24.180 --> 00:50:30.149
Lance Byrd: good. I think i'll be able to make it to that. But i'll have to double check that there is something good

527
00:50:30.450 --> 00:50:31.729
Lance Byrd: meetings.

528
00:50:33.620 --> 00:50:35.660
Lance Byrd: all right, great.

529
00:50:36.190 --> 00:50:38.310
Rodolfo Miranda: I actually also once I just post

530
00:50:38.430 --> 00:50:41.790
Rodolfo Miranda: the links to the rendered person. So

531
00:50:42.190 --> 00:50:42.810
is that

532
00:50:47.430 --> 00:50:50.579
Lance Byrd: okay? So this is what they presented.

533
00:50:52.940 --> 00:50:54.479
Lance Byrd: An Iw.

534
00:50:55.920 --> 00:51:00.219
Lance Byrd: at least 3 digital exchange protocols.

535
00:51:03.710 --> 00:51:04.649
Lance Byrd: Okay.

536
00:51:06.400 --> 00:51:07.250
Lance Byrd: Yeah.

537
00:51:07.930 --> 00:51:10.350
Lance Byrd: we'll try to find.

538
00:51:14.190 --> 00:51:17.029
Lance Byrd: Try to find that diagram. That

539
00:51:18.120 --> 00:51:19.330
Lance Byrd: the Drummond

540
00:51:19.580 --> 00:51:20.520
head.

541
00:51:22.730 --> 00:51:24.259
Lance Byrd: All right, cool.

542
00:51:25.380 --> 00:51:28.079
Lance Byrd: I'll put that in the notes as well.

543
00:51:31.750 --> 00:51:34.509
Lance Byrd: and you had one other spec.

544
00:51:35.380 --> 00:51:38.890
Rodolfo Miranda: I think it is the same in

545
00:51:38.920 --> 00:51:39.959
Lance Byrd: Gotcha.

546
00:51:40.560 --> 00:51:42.149
Lance Byrd: All right. Good.

547
00:51:46.680 --> 00:51:54.250
Lance Byrd: Okay. Anything else. we should maybe talk really quickly about our meetings

548
00:51:54.320 --> 00:52:02.299
Lance Byrd: since we're coming up to the holiday times. it is the 12 today.

549
00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:12.769
Lance Byrd: So I would think we can s probably sneak in one more meeting, and then is everybody okay with us canceling until the New Year?

550
00:52:12.900 --> 00:52:14.530
Lance Byrd: Let me just look at the

551
00:52:15.940 --> 00:52:20.989
Lance Byrd: the calendar, or, if you know, Obviously, if people want to meet, they can.

552
00:52:23.780 --> 00:52:27.799
Lance Byrd: Looks like if we waited till

553
00:52:28.220 --> 00:52:30.779
Rodolfo Miranda: you say can cancel the 26.

554
00:52:30.910 --> 00:52:36.219
Rodolfo Miranda: I'm the second of January.

555
00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:43.769
Hakan: Okay, I mean, i'm just taking the Christmas week off. Otherwise i'll be available.

556
00:52:44.600 --> 00:52:50.859
Lance Byrd: Okay, that would, if we took the yeah, if we did, the 26 and second off. Then that would put us back

557

558
00:52:53.630 --> 00:52:54.550

560
00:53:06.290 --> 00:53:13.740
Lance Byrd: and i'll post that as well in our discord, which I guess i'll post it in the discord literally asking him to remove those

567
00:53:47.130 --> 00:54:02.209
Lance Byrd: going to be able to interoperate? and we'll consider the Trust over. IP stack more. And then Obviously, we'll be following the pull requests and and discussions within the Yakapug and the Aries javascript meeting.

568

582
00:55:00.910 --> 00:55:08.439
Alex: Yeah. So there was like a little bit of discussion of like what the timeline of the Pr. Was going to be. It wasn't really discussion about the Pr. Itself.

583
00:55:08.590 --> 00:55:09.840
Alex: and they

584
00:55:10.440 --> 00:55:20.850
Alex: like. Unfortunately, t-mo wasn't there, so they didn't really go through any code, and they were saying how it might take a couple of months for the code to get merge for the company to in a

585
00:55:21.580 --> 00:55:25.149
Alex: at least, that was kind of like what Mike was saying

Alex: from a northern block.

587

591
00:55:37.860 --> 00:55:41.340
Alex: It's just because of the holidays and and what not.

Lance Byrd: I don't know I I do want to.

607
00:57:01.570 --> 00:57:16.960
Lance Byrd: honestly, i'm I don't have. I haven't had enough time to really solidify kind of the documentation and everything that we've been doing for this other than what we have in our meeting notes.

608
00:57:17.140 --> 00:57:19.559
Lance Byrd: But I do think

609
00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:29.899
Lance Byrd: yeah, some some a a more solid way to kind of document. All of the activities and different pain points is still a big goal of mine. I just

610
00:57:30.020 --> 00:57:31.630
Lance Byrd: Haven't had time to really

611
00:57:32.360 --> 00:57:40.019
Lance Byrd: really put that together. I think eventually it will come together. But I I think we're capturing a lot of important ideas. That will help that. So

612
00:57:40.260 --> 00:57:41.750
Lance Byrd: it's really good.

613
00:57:44.430 --> 00:57:45.279
