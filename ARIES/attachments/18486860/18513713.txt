00:13:06	Tomislav Markovski:	+1 for network in did method
00:13:35	Drummond Reed:	-1 to doing that
00:13:39	Drummond Reed:	VERY bad idea

01:25:38	Andrew Whitehead:	put a password on the zip file! :)
01:34:35	Nathan George:	Pipe friendly is good
01:35:40	Andrew Whitehead:	A bit late to introduce this but there might be some overlap with identity hubs, as in a directory of protocol-specific data objects
