00:09:03	mwherman2000:	I can't see the grid? 
00:10:05	Ajay:	Its here - https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/ARIES/Aries+Working+Group
00:11:54	Cam Parra:	Can we get link to meet up?
00:12:04	Cam Parra:	Thank you
00:23:45	Troy Ronda:	How does the AMS/DRI naming relate to the KMS naming last week?
00:24:18	Cam Parra:	KMS is just part of AMS
00:25:19	Nader:	+1 to the simplified repo approach
00:26:27	Troy Ronda:	Ah ok. What’s an example of a data element stored in DRI? I assume the metadata discussed last week is still in KMS.
00:28:06	mwherman2000:	AMS=?
00:29:47	George Aristy:	Agent Managed Storage
00:29:50	Troy Ronda:	Is there some common code in aries-ams beyond interfaces?
00:36:30	mwherman2000:	Aries Runtime?
00:38:24	Nader:	is it really an SDK if we pull all of the AMS logic out of that repo?
00:40:14	Gary de Beer:	core +1
00:40:47	Paul Knowles:	We can call things “Core”, “Mantel”, “Crust”
00:41:12	Paul Knowles:	Not sure if I’m joking or not …
00:42:44	Ajay:	+1 for Core
00:44:33	Ajay:	Will it be all in Rust?
00:52:38	Cam Parra:	Yes rust is the language for these repos
00:53:13	Stephen Curran:	@troy - DRI is anything written to the ledger. DIDs, schema, etc.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
00:53:34	Stephen Curran:	DR is the name that W3C came up with for the ledger.
00:55:50	Troy Ronda:	I think test suites are a good idea. I want to make sure that test suite inclusion isn’t a gate keeper function though.
01:03:16	Gustavo Frederico (Pivotree):	An alternative is to choose a date to turn warnings into errors.
01:07:04	George Aristy:	Pending questions for the protocol test suite (written by Daniel): https://hackmd.io/JW5b9xYCRGKqyqhVevTZ_g
01:17:52	Troy Ronda:	Thanks @Stephen
01:26:40	George Aristy:	sorry
