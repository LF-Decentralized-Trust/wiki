08:05:13	 From  Sam Curren (TelegramSam) : https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/ARIES/2022-06-29+Aries+Working+Group+Call
08:09:05	 From  Mike Ebert (Indicio)   to   Sam Curren (TelegramSam)(Direct Message) : Do we want to tell him about Kim's work on proxy mediators? We ship this standard now.
08:09:23	 From  Sam Curren (TelegramSam)   to   Mike Ebert (Indicio)(Direct Message) : it's different...
08:09:32	 From  Sam Curren (TelegramSam)   to   Mike Ebert (Indicio)(Direct Message) : ledger access isn't included in the proxy mediator I think.
08:09:37	 From  Sam Curren (TelegramSam)   to   Mike Ebert (Indicio)(Direct Message) : or am I wrong?
08:09:38	 From  Mike Ebert (Indicio)   to   Sam Curren (TelegramSam)(Direct Message) : Ahhh, ledger access.
08:10:27	 From  Mike Ebert (Indicio)   to   Sam Curren (TelegramSam)(Direct Message) : Not 100% sure, probably different.
08:23:40	 From  Timo Glastra : Wasn't at the start of the meeting so don't know whether this has already be discussed, but I think there's a lot to learn from other ledgers here. Looking at e.g. Ethereum you need to provide an RPC url that you connect through, from there on it's just simple http calls
08:24:23	 From  Stephen Curran : Yes -- that's definitely an option, Timo -- discussed earlier and possible!
08:24:33	 From  Timo Glastra : 👍
08:25:49	 From  Timo Glastra : If possible, I think we should also take into account browser compatability. As ZMQ can't be used in the browser it has been a limitation for possibly using indy from the browser
08:28:52	 From  Kim Ebert : I would be concerned about scaling on the ledger side with didcomm
08:39:20	 From  Mike Ebert (Indicio) : I would love to get a copy of this, I have some work with OCA that I need to do as soon as I can get to it.
08:41:38	 From  Sam Curren (TelegramSam)   to   Mike Ebert (Indicio)(Direct Message) : the spreadsheet to file generator option may be a hack we can use with MRG.
08:42:56	 From  Mike Ebert (Indicio)   to   Sam Curren (TelegramSam)(Direct Message) : Mmm. Might work. CSV --> JSON...
08:44:50	 From  Sam Curren (TelegramSam)   to   Mike Ebert (Indicio)(Direct Message) : similar signing issues.
08:44:58	 From  Mike Ebert (Indicio)   to   Sam Curren (TelegramSam)(Direct Message) : Yup.
08:45:26	 From  Mike Ebert (Indicio)   to   Sam Curren (TelegramSam)(Direct Message) : I need to dig into this for both the OCA and the related MRG concepts. Let's make sure we can get a copy...
08:46:16	 From  Sam Curren (TelegramSam) : Bundle can also be referenced in Machine Readable Governance.
08:46:36	 From  Sam Curren (TelegramSam) : (in addition to other methods)
08:48:44	 From  Sam Curren (TelegramSam)   to   Mike Ebert (Indicio)(Direct Message) : Bundle Creation + MRG makes this actually fairly easy for us to leverage.
08:49:17	 From  Mike Ebert (Indicio)   to   Sam Curren (TelegramSam)(Direct Message) : Agreed
08:50:09	 From  Andrew Whitehead : It feels like ARS should be the ledger itself, but we're avoiding making changes there. Hopefully it handles tails files?
08:50:47	 From  Sam Curren (TelegramSam) : I think the ledger would be a great place, but likely can't be the only place.
08:58:37	 From  Mike Ebert (Indicio) : This is pretty exciting. I'm feeling like I'm finally ready to look at OCA. Thank you, Stephen.
08:59:37	 From  Mike Ebert (Indicio) : No, a general way is waaaaay better
08:59:47	 From  Mike Ebert (Indicio) : I have to run, thanks again!
