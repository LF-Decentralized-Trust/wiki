Sam Curren (TelegramSam): Very cool.

33
00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:23.200
Sam Curren (TelegramSam): Thank you. Steven.

34
00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:39.379
Sam Curren (TelegramSam): Awesome. Okay. Here's topics for today. Alex, we may not need to do the areas marketing update unless you want it to additionally given the presence of the call. But I wanted to at least call attention. There. Is there anything you want to say in this meeting specifically about that, or

35
00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:45.709
Alex Metcalf: I'll give you like a 1 min update for sure, and then we can carry on with the majority of that material through to the working group call.

36
00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:48.030
Sam Curren (TelegramSam): You've got a minute.

37
00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:58.650
Alex Metcalf: sweet. okay. to say that the just to update the deal that things are moving forward. really? Well, I spoke to several of you in the week.

38
00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:04.740
Alex Metcalf: You could sell this and Helen and Sebastus, and looking at

39
00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:15.710
Alex Metcalf:  the the link. There is going to be a working documents which is gonna work so bottom up. And some of the materials we need. But just suffice to say, that

40
00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:26.620
Alex Metcalf: is, bring up some really interesting questions as to to do this exercise, and to think how we present ourselves, and how we have a better Wiki landing page, and how we by the page and the hyper light, and all those kind of things.

41
00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:43.740
Alex Metcalf: It's being questions as to what Harry's need to be presenting itself as as it's a Samuel. They what are the 3 things it does great, for example, that would be amazing highlights of people coming in that would be differentiators. So give me some exercises around that. Helen's got a great question that we'll probably use come

42
00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:45.140
Alex Metcalf: next week.

43
00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:57.819
Alex Metcalf: But if I say, you're welcome to look at that document for updates. I'd be putting some more things in that'd be working off of the need to go back into there. But if you go, any interest in how you present ourselves, if you or any parts of like

44
00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:12.639
Alex Metcalf: of things that we could say better or materials that we need or videos, we should highlight or any aspects of this you can reach out to me, or you can use this document or come along even better to the first being that I just mentioned.

45
00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:31.280
Alex Metcalf: So Moving along with a focus on what's the low hanging fruit to get some more accurate information up first, and then we might refine that later. So let's get some things up to say what areas is doing now, because lot of information out there is is 2,019 era from, you know, announcements of what this is, and things have moved along a lot since then.

46
00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:37.429
Alex Metcalf: And now is that time to shine? So yeah, thank you for all the people I reached out to you and hope to see no of you next week.

47
00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:59.889
Sam Curren (TelegramSam): yeah, thank you. Alex. I will credit Alex for making me think about things like, how to properly articulate. what is different about Aries than than other agent projects that did used to be a question, because there kind of weren't any other agent projects. And so that is that's something that's made me think a lot. So so they're they're doing fantastic work.

48
00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:12.720
Sam Curren (TelegramSam): okay, quick, update there the stuff we have on the I guess next next week is not mediators, because this week is mediators. I bet. Edit we have a a couple of main topics.

49
00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:31.359
Sam Curren (TelegramSam): Oh, one that's not in the list, but but is another quick update is the open wallet foundation update and then we want to talk about mediators. and the the the did peer, unqualified. Did mediation update. There's now a migration, Doc. which would be awesome.

50
00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:39.829
Sam Curren (TelegramSam): so so yes, that is the that's the goal there. any any adjustments we want to make

51
00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:44.140
Sam Curren (TelegramSam): before yeah, any adjustments. We want to make it to the agenda before we get going.

52
00:08:50.560 --> 00:09:14.110
Sam Curren (TelegramSam): okay, owf, update. last week we you know, I shared a a link for a sort of a a proposed collaboration type of a statement. and we're still working through. I say, we Alex has volunteered to to be involved in that more directly. and so we are, still, having conversations with auto be of leadership to figure out the

53
00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:26.929
Sam Curren (TelegramSam): sort of the right thing and path forward there. And so it's happening, although a little slower. there's a little bit of confusion in there, and we're working to resolve that. so yes, and Timo any other

54
00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:31.750
Sam Curren (TelegramSam): comments. Another. Vf.

55
00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:42.330
Timo Glastra:  yeah, maybe 2. One question on like you said, like, still in discussion, I think

56
00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:47.100
Timo Glastra: owf like in, like their

57
00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:58.140
Timo Glastra: already partners, with high pledge and a and so I think it was kind of finished right? The discussion at least that's what I heard from. Oh, owf! site!

58
00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:02.110
Timo Glastra:  But that's not true.

59
00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:22.779
Sam Curren (TelegramSam): No. Well, it's it's let me try and explain a little bit. There was a a little bit of a misunderstanding about the purpose of the. It's sort of a joint statement that we are proposing. There isn't any legal changes actually necessary between the organizations. There wasn't any actually in the beginning, anyway, because of the compatible licenses. being used by the different organizations.

60
00:10:23.210 --> 00:10:26.500
Sam Curren (TelegramSam): the point of the statement was more of a signal of like

61
00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:44.190
Sam Curren (TelegramSam): collaboration, not necessarily the establishment of anything like legal, necessarily. And so there's a little bit of confusion early on about what the intent was, or whether something was actually needed. And and that's that confusion is is being resolved and and unraveled a little bit as we go.

62
00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:59.849
Sam Curren (TelegramSam): So the the their response was, based on a legal perspective when they're not wrong. but the but our goal wasn't really to us. That was something legal, either. And so it it also wasn't really completely the thing that we were trying to do

63
00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:11.970
Sam Curren (TelegramSam): and and so trying to resolve the the confusion there. And I think we're based on emails yesterday. that, I think we have. Even up to yesterday evening we have some increased understanding. There.

64
00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:14.960
Sam Curren (TelegramSam): does that help T-mo

65
00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:22.589
Timo Glastra: or any other comments there?

66
00:11:23.770 --> 00:11:24.630
Timo Glastra: I

67
00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:31.500
Timo Glastra: not 100% happy yet, I think with outcome. and

68
00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:48.300
Timo Glastra: that's okay. I think because we don't have to all agree on on like the the outcome. But I do think it's still interesting to pursue, and I think I would also. And this is something we would have to discuss, for example, in

69
00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:54.310
Timo Glastra: for example, air soon with Javascript community. But if there is like if

70
00:11:54.430 --> 00:12:21.680
Timo Glastra: the open Wallace foundation as a whole isn't ready yet to host a whole project like ours. Like we could try moving single projects over, for example, and see how that works. And if we can make that work and do that one by one and so like, I can't speak for the whole Afgh community here, of course, but Something that I would be interested to, and, for example, for seeing you like being a guinea pig project that

71
00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:33.400
Timo Glastra: that we can try things out with, I think. because I think the main thing we have set here, like owf is not ready to

72
00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:44.569
Timo Glastra: like. It's very not mature. I think I heard from owf. Also there they've offered to to basically hire everyone on the hyper ledger

73
00:12:44.630 --> 00:12:53.209
Timo Glastra: like that can help in how I that helps with hyperbolic on the infrastructure and operational site that they have offered to hire them. So I think that that should give

74
00:12:53.220 --> 00:13:08.720
Timo Glastra: quite a lot of assurance. but yeah, just wanted to try it out here. so I one thing that I want to highlight there is that I I wouldn't really consider

75
00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:37.169
Sam Curren (TelegramSam): what we've proposed is sort of a final outcome in any way, but rather an intermediate step that can be something that we do and get done. but that doesn't necessarily pre preclude any future actions there either. This be the the the nature of these things is as as I I've heard Steven say a lot is is a doocracy in the sense that that the the people who do have the most control over over what's going on. And so the Maintainer of of any individual project or

76
00:13:37.170 --> 00:14:04.889
Sam Curren (TelegramSam): or library matter the most when it comes to sort of what actually happens. You know individually there. we are a voluntary coalition of of of of projects that are together, etc. And and I think that there's some there. There's some helpful pieces there definitely, some discussion to be had, and I and I think that any I think the progress that does move forward would be substantially easier if it's a little bit more gradual. and that allows for

77
00:14:05.410 --> 00:14:17.099
Sam Curren (TelegramSam): the the change to be metabolized in a in a in a, in a easier way. There are some open questions there. And so definitely, there's ongoing things. I I don't really consider this to be like a done and

78
00:14:17.130 --> 00:14:18.280
Sam Curren (TelegramSam): and

79
00:14:18.650 --> 00:14:24.839
Sam Curren (TelegramSam): and in no more discussion but rather the change. The nature of the discussion. in a way that allows us to

80
00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:36.850
Sam Curren (TelegramSam): to accomplish things in a more targeted way as we desire. So what you described there, Timo was not really at least in in my brain, out of scope for what? What's possible in the future?

81
00:14:40.390 --> 00:14:44.489
Sam Curren (TelegramSam): Any any other comments or questions from anyone on that particular topic.

82
00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:52.740
John Jordan: I will be having a try to have a discussion with Daniel tomorrow. If

83
00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:55.489
John Jordan: there's points people need to

84
00:14:56.010 --> 00:14:59.169
John Jordan: cover or not cover. I'm happy to receive those

85
00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:01.670
Sam Curren (TelegramSam): cool.

86
00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:09.159
Sam Curren (TelegramSam): Yes, please reach out. Thanks, John, for for for being involved, and and and you can reach out to John for

87
00:15:09.610 --> 00:15:11.510
Sam Curren (TelegramSam): anything that you would like to share.

88
00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:16.429
Sam Curren (TelegramSam):  John, you're on discord, I do believe.

89
00:15:16.590 --> 00:15:17.330
John Jordan: Yep.

90
00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:19.449
Sam Curren (TelegramSam): And so John is reachable. There.

91
00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:23.859
Sam Curren (TelegramSam): cool any other questions, comments.

92
00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:29.320
Sam Curren (TelegramSam): okay.

93
00:15:29.810 --> 00:15:38.549
Sam Curren (TelegramSam): next, up on the agenda here today is mediators. and I wanted Steven. I brought up the concept of

94
00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:40.360
Sam Curren (TelegramSam): a

95
00:15:40.730 --> 00:15:50.499
Sam Curren (TelegramSam): of having a sort of a mediator status update round up thing. And so I'm gonna check this over to him for an intro there.

96
00:15:51.750 --> 00:15:54.390
Stephen Curran: all right. I'll just do

97
00:15:54.410 --> 00:16:07.919
Stephen Curran: an intro to the problem. is my thought. Just so. We have a a foundation for for discussion, and we'll go from there and see how things. hopefully, this helps.

98
00:16:08.020 --> 00:16:19.789
Stephen Curran: I all I am is a messenger of the problems. I don't have great solutions, so Not going to help there, but I'll show you where we've got to and our and are talking about it.

99
00:16:20.210 --> 00:16:28.370
Stephen Curran: everyone knows what a mediator is. Mediators are used for wallets. In particular, they can be used elsewhere. Actually, we're we're.

100
00:16:28.690 --> 00:16:43.170
Stephen Curran: I had a brief talk this week about whether we can use mediators to get rid of the developer problem within Brock. Because. we're finding some of our developers work for companies that don't allow the use of end rock.

101
00:16:43.370 --> 00:16:48.470
Stephen Curran: And we could actually use mediators for so me, if not just for

102
00:16:48.870 --> 00:16:52.489
Stephen Curran: Wallace, but that's the biggest use.

103
00:16:52.560 --> 00:17:06.349
Stephen Curran: for scalability. We want to be able to use a container orchestration platform, some horizontally scalable platform for using it. Scale. the number of instance of a mediator. As the low growth increases or decreases.

104
00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:24.049
Stephen Curran: support migration of instances. So from time to time a platform scheduler, like open shift, will suddenly say, Hey, I'm gonna shut down this node. So everything is on. It needs to get migrated somewhere else, so instances would be shut down and started up elsewhere. That's gotta be supported.

105
00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:26.879
Stephen Curran: we need queued messages?

106
00:17:26.970 --> 00:17:45.449
Stephen Curran: so that when a instance is shut down or started up, or when wallets are not connected, to messages are not lost. So they're not sitting in a in a memory queue associated with the instance, and then get lost when that instance disappears, for whatever reason.

107
00:17:46.150 --> 00:18:06.030
Stephen Curran: And then the other thing is, we want to understand what scalable means for any particular solution. How many wallets can we actually support? what are the assumptions about? How many active wallets there's likely to be for a given use case. We've had lots of discussions around the Vc. Wall, and on that case well, if we add, you know

108
00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:22.020
Stephen Curran: a a population of 50,000 users. Well, how many are going to be active in any one time? How many? How many messages are we going to be able to process for those? What does it need for there to be 50,000 wallets out in the wild?

109
00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:26.450
Stephen Curran: in terms of how scalable the

110
00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:42.939
Stephen Curran:  mediator is. So I've got pictures to follow and Ares example. And then mediator examples and the complications. So the naive approach is on an Aries agent is everything's talking https.

111
00:18:43.090 --> 00:18:48.920
Stephen Curran: you simply increase the instances and scale up by load.

112
00:18:49.010 --> 00:19:09.549
Stephen Curran: And so as as things get busier. You add another Aries instance, and another Aries instance, whether that be occupy or Aj or whatever it is. you've got agents out in the while talking through this endpoint, and then that gets load balanced across these. You also have the controller whoops

113
00:19:09.670 --> 00:19:16.910
Stephen Curran: didn't need to do that, but you also have the controller. that's sitting out there.

114
00:19:17.780 --> 00:19:20.490
Stephen Curran: hang on 1 s. I move that.

115
00:19:20.610 --> 00:19:26.090
Stephen Curran: you also have the controller. that is talking to the various instances.

116
00:19:26.410 --> 00:19:51.930
Stephen Curran: so a big issue there, if the instances are lost. Messages are queued on these instances. If if things get really busy, the instances start to queue messages if the instances fail, or or, more precisely, when the instances fail, because it will happen. Cute messages are lost. So that's no good. The next approach that we've taken is, we add, a redis queue.

117
00:19:51.930 --> 00:19:57.170
Stephen Curran: the way it was done in the first cut of this

118
00:19:57.190 --> 00:20:25.560
Stephen Curran: group from keyboard first began this work, or a person from Quebec. And this work was to add a relay that basically received messages sucked them on the queue, and then Aries instance to stuff out on messages onto the queue, and those relays would send them back out. And this was all good when all we talked were https all of the ages the Controller could talk to the endpoints.

119
00:20:25.770 --> 00:20:42.800
Stephen Curran: Messages would go in and out of the queue. So Redis is just a sample of the queue. You could use capital or other other items other persistent queue mechanisms, for that. Messages are not lost. When Aries instances go away or when relays go away.

120
00:20:42.990 --> 00:20:49.280
Stephen Curran: Any instance can process any inbound message, any relay. You can send any outbound message?

121
00:20:49.510 --> 00:20:54.139
Stephen Curran: as noted the relay is it required? The are these instances

122
00:20:54.290 --> 00:21:10.640
Stephen Curran: perform all of the tasks to push and pull messages from the queue, and basically everything is stateless, which is exactly what we want. Yay, Happily, there's no state involved. And so things that's sufficient. If

123
00:21:10.890 --> 00:21:19.770
Stephen Curran: all we have is a cps. So media air adds more complexity. So the mediator picture is slightly different.

124
00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:42.670
Stephen Curran: I I first of all, I left out the control, or just to make it simpler. we talked about this. We can configure the mediator to the auto. Accept that. I'm willing to mediate for anybody that asks, or you can even make it a plugin to, you know a Fj. Or occupy, or whatever you're using as your mediator. so that doesn't have to be external.

125
00:21:42.790 --> 00:21:49.910
Stephen Curran: an external entity. So just make it simpler. I I got rid of the Controller.

126
00:21:50.450 --> 00:21:54.269
Stephen Curran: agents send in messages.

127
00:21:54.510 --> 00:22:12.909
Stephen Curran: that are sorry wallet. Send messages directly to agents. So a wallet wallets are over here. Agents are over here. Obviously, while it's our agents, too. They're all wages, but they the way the agents use? the mediator, is different from how the Wallace uses. So

128
00:22:12.910 --> 00:22:28.099
Stephen Curran: while it send messages directly to Asians, so that means when our wallet needs to do an outbound message. It can send it directly. It does not have to flow through the mediator, and that's generally what's done. So messages do not flow through the mediator. When this happens.

129
00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:50.149
Stephen Curran:  Inbound messages are all out down to a specific wallet after mediator instance processing, so the wallet may be offline. So it has to get queued. So we probably need Redis again. So this idea that we're sitting here with no queue. That's probably naive, so that we're going to have to address that.

130
00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:58.120
Stephen Curran: And then the next thing, those wallet to mediator instances are are sticking. So so what I'm saying, there is basically a shoot.

131
00:22:58.450 --> 00:23:13.320
Stephen Curran: a a a message from an agent coming in is bound for a wallet, but it has to be sent through a mediator instance that interprets the message. Figure out the wall that it's for, and then sends it to that wallet.

132
00:23:13.730 --> 00:23:15.290
Stephen Curran: Now, what

133
00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:43.369
Stephen Curran: what happens is the wall. It's mediator instance connections are sticking. So that means when a message comes in after the connections been established between a mediator and a wallet, the next message has to flow outbound to the wallet through that mediator. So now, if the load Balancer receives a message, sends it to the media to the first mediator instance, it has to send it over to the second mediator instance

134
00:23:43.370 --> 00:23:50.190
Stephen Curran: and then over to the wallet. So that means basically, we're no longer stateless.

135
00:23:50.730 --> 00:24:15.679
Stephen Curran: And that's where the problems come in. Note that the connected instance, this mediator instance is talking to this wallet until one of them disconnects, and then the wallet has to recap. So this mediator could disappear. This wallet could stop for a while and then start again. When that happens, this wallet is going to go through the load balancer again and establish a connection to some

136
00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:22.609
Stephen Curran: any of the mediators could be the same, one could be a different one. So that's where we also get into handling issues.

137
00:24:23.740 --> 00:24:28.360
Stephen Curran: I see there's a chat. Hope this is helpful.

138
00:24:35.440 --> 00:25:05.279
Stephen Curran: plus. He was just asking if Mobile to Mobile I mean, this wallet is talking to this wallet from each of the wallets. Perspective. They're just agents. They have no idea that they're they're each other's wallets, or they are our fellow wallets. So if a wallet is talking to another wallet, each of them perceives the other is just some external agent, and it doesn't care. Know that it's another wallet. It that's a that's a circumstance that I would

139
00:25:05.470 --> 00:25:16.720
Stephen Curran: a detailed, that it's not really relevant to this. Both of them have to do it. But it's not. It's not a special case. In other words, that's not really a special case.

140
00:25:19.030 --> 00:25:28.409
Clecio Varjao: Oh, just on your second point where I said, Wallace sent a message directly to agents. I guess that's how what you're making. The distinction

141
00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:45.020
Stephen Curran: is in a conversation with another wallet. It thinks of it as just some other agent. It doesn't care it to the wallet, and it it might even, you know, it could be a wallet that doesn't share the same mediator, even

142
00:25:45.030 --> 00:25:50.649
Clecio Varjao: right so. But to generalize mobile wallets did not send a message directly. That's what

143
00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:56.640
Stephen Curran: they send it to, whatever the endpoint the other agent tells it. To

144
00:25:58.290 --> 00:26:13.129
Stephen Curran: whatever whatever endpoint this agent has said, if that's a mediator, that's a mediator, if it's directly to the agent, it doesn't matter. I could. I could say to what th this should say, I guess, directly to the ages endpoint to be more precise.

145
00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:16.330
Stephen Curran: that makes sense.

146
00:26:19.150 --> 00:26:25.760
Clecio Varjao:  not quite because in a wallet, to all that situation where they have here

147
00:26:25.950 --> 00:26:38.710
Clecio Varjao: did. Yes, you're right. It's always directed by the the peer that defines the endpoint. But I'm just making a point that outgoing message can also go through the mediator if directed. So

148
00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:41.490
Clecio Varjao: it's not a rule.

149
00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:52.899
Stephen Curran: I don't know of any case where it would go through the mediator, unless. like, if the 2 wallets don't have the same mediator, it wouldn't go back through the same mediator. It would go to a different mediator.

150
00:26:54.600 --> 00:27:06.029
Clecio Varjao: Okay? we've figured out we can put that on the we can keep going. It's just like, is it not clear the mobile to mobile agent situation. there's 2,

151
00:27:06.580 --> 00:27:21.579
Clecio Varjao: I think, I think, as far as I understand, and maybe from my Fj. Or from from a I can. It's better. There's a communication through the mediator. Yeah. So basically, the the end point of the other agent happens to be a mobile agent.

152
00:27:21.620 --> 00:27:36.710
Kim Ebert: And so it would also have a mediator, and it might be the same mediator as the other mobile agent is using. And so from mobile to mobile communication. The outbound communication may also go to the same mediator.

153
00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:47.689
Stephen Curran: But again, I I yeah, I I I mean I I that's totally true. What I'm saying is, it's I don't think it's relevant to the use case because

154
00:27:47.850 --> 00:27:55.820
Stephen Curran: the wallet sends it to wherever the aid the other other party says to send messages. It doesn't

155
00:27:55.930 --> 00:28:01.519
Stephen Curran: say to the mediator, Hey, I need you to send this message over to this other place for me.

156
00:28:01.900 --> 00:28:04.980
Stephen Curran: it! It's sending it to where the

157
00:28:05.340 --> 00:28:10.100
Stephen Curran: other agent, whether it be a wall or not, tells it to.

158
00:28:11.890 --> 00:28:32.189
Colton Wolkins: and I think a bit of clarification here the mediator cluster that's being referred to in this diagram is the individual wallet's mediator. When it is communicating to an agent that agent may be, or maybe behind its own mediator, which is separate from the wallets. Mediator.

159
00:28:32.450 --> 00:28:33.380
Stephen Curran: Correct.

160
00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:55.949
Rodolfo Miranda: Stephanie. 1 one question regarding this the cluster. So that means that they all those instance mediator, have a share database or share storage, have all persist the messages, but also persist. The keys all share the keys.

161
00:28:56.110 --> 00:28:56.970
Stephen Curran: Yes.

162
00:28:58.350 --> 00:29:14.070
Stephen Curran: yes, these I I took that detail out. But yes, there's a shared database here that all are using. So so as in the as in the previous diagram, there isn't, you know. I ask our or, you know.

163
00:29:14.780 --> 00:29:17.669
Stephen Curran: secure storage that is shared amongst them.

164
00:29:20.710 --> 00:29:23.210
Stephen Curran: And then with this, I'm adding.

165
00:29:23.770 --> 00:29:27.880
Stephen Curran: now we've got to have red us because we have to have Redis, so that

166
00:29:28.030 --> 00:29:39.569
Stephen Curran:  messages for Wallace that are not connected, or for the loss of mediator instances. You have to have some sort of persistent queue. So you don't lose that

167
00:29:40.130 --> 00:29:42.690
Stephen Curran:  again.

168
00:29:42.860 --> 00:29:57.120
Stephen Curran: relay, is it necessarily required it could be a a mechanism. So again, a relay is simply just something that is, receives messages, puts them on the queue, takes things off the queue and sends them along.

169
00:29:58.430 --> 00:30:02.289
Stephen Curran: Oh, the the the other thing that I

170
00:30:02.430 --> 00:30:07.870
Stephen Curran: I have a new map. I have a new trap. The other thing that I didn't highlight

171
00:30:08.050 --> 00:30:09.550
Stephen Curran: is that

172
00:30:10.310 --> 00:30:22.510
Stephen Curran: inbound messages all come in via Https outbound message or or messages to wallets. between the media and the wall, up our web sockets. So these are persistent. There, there

173
00:30:23.100 --> 00:30:35.070
Stephen Curran: they've done over Hdp, but the connection remains, and multiple messages go back and forth across them, and that's the stickiness that that is, that is there. So once a wallet.

174
00:30:35.130 --> 00:30:42.879
Stephen Curran: a step. And actually, I'll get into that in the next in the next slide. So so how do, how do ballots connect

175
00:30:43.210 --> 00:30:44.540
Stephen Curran: to relays?

176
00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:46.970
Stephen Curran: Is this

177
00:30:46.980 --> 00:30:51.770
Stephen Curran: level of hopefully, this level is is right. So

178
00:30:51.980 --> 00:30:57.499
the starting point is, the wallets are not connected to the mediator at all. they're just

179
00:30:57.820 --> 00:31:15.050
Stephen Curran: live. They activate. And then and they create a did call and request to send to the wallet. And that request is gonna be one of 3 things. One is, will you be my mediator? So the wallet has never connected to mediator and wants to have the mediator, be it

180
00:31:15.050 --> 00:31:38.610
Stephen Curran: I have to have that mediator instance be it's mediator, so will you be. My mediator is one type. The second one is, oh, I've got a new connection that I want to establish Will you mediate a new connection informally? So this is where it's it's establishing a peer-to-peer connection with some other agent in that agent could be a a, a another wallet, or anything.

181
00:31:38.610 --> 00:31:40.239
Stephen Curran: and then finally.

182
00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:50.290
Stephen Curran: a wallet that perhaps just disconnected or just came online is gonna connect is going to create a request that says, Do you have any messages for me?

183
00:31:50.560 --> 00:31:57.329
Stephen Curran: So one of those 3 messages are gonna come in. They're gonna send the the the mediators to send that request

184
00:31:57.340 --> 00:32:20.699
Stephen Curran: the load balancer on the instances gonna route that to a receiver, whether that be a mediator, a relay. I'm just calling it a receiver. The wallet and the receiver from then on remain connected until something causes that connection to be lost, and while they're connected any messages between the entire mediator cluster and the wallet.

185
00:32:20.890 --> 00:32:25.510
Stephen Curran: all are all must be

186
00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:53.910
Stephen Curran: sent through that particular receiver. So coming back here, if this wallet connection with R. 3. Any messages destined for this wallet must be sent by R. 3, because it's got an established connection. Web socket connection R. 2 can't initiate a connection, and wall and the wallet. So therefore it can't send a message to this specific wallet. So that's that's the stickiness that's involved.

187
00:32:56.390 --> 00:33:05.910
Stephen Curran: If any new messages come in for the wallet to the mediator. So again, any any agent sends the messages in

188
00:33:05.930 --> 00:33:15.170
Stephen Curran: to the to the mediator. it must be routed through whatever is connected to that wallet, you know. R. 3 or

189
00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:25.300
Stephen Curran: If there's a drop connection we start back with the. Do you have any messages for me? And that's likely to go to a different receiver.

190
00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:28.020
Stephen Curran: So we wind up with

191
00:33:28.330 --> 00:33:37.649
Stephen Curran: you know it gets load balance, it gets sent to a different receiver instance, and that receiver now has the connection. So the challenges you. You wind up with that

192
00:33:37.790 --> 00:33:44.229
Stephen Curran:  Each mediator instance is connected to a bunch of wallets.

193
00:33:44.350 --> 00:33:55.199
Stephen Curran: So each has a wallet id and each has a you know, some sort has a web socket connection. So one question is, how many web sockets could each instance handle?

194
00:33:55.270 --> 00:34:19.109
Stephen Curran: how many does it need to handle? So if you've got, you know, province of of British Columbia has 4 million residents that may get a B C wallet. How many? how many are going to be active at any one time we'll have an active web socket. And how many instances? will we need to handle that many web sockets distributed across?

195
00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:36.139
Stephen Curran: a thousand 10,000. You know. What's the number? We don't really know.  agent send in messages. Address to a wallet Id. So inbound messages coming to the mediator that are destined to a wallet.

196
00:34:36.170 --> 00:35:01.870
Stephen Curran: aren't they? Don't know the The 2 address of the wallet until the message has been processed by a mediator instance. So in the case of a relay, the relay will be able to interpret the message. A relay is just passing on messages inbound and outbound. So we're assuming it. It doesn't decrypt the message, and therefore it can't determine the destination. Wall, it did

197
00:35:01.930 --> 00:35:14.739
Stephen Curran: so. That has to be done after a mediator instance is processed it? this. This is the tricky part. How do the messages get to the right instance? given that there's

198
00:35:14.890 --> 00:35:24.479
Stephen Curran: If there's no connection it just goes into a pending queue to be picked up when the wallet connects. That should be a question mark that should be a statement.

199
00:35:24.660 --> 00:35:51.589
Stephen Curran:  if queue how it is an instance? Query the King, for all its messages. So suppose an instance has 10,000 web sockets, you know 10,000 wallets connected via web sockets. How does it find all the messages for all those 10,000 wallets? presuming it can't go polling through to say you have any messages for wallet? One. What about Wallet? 2. What about Wallet 3 can't do polling? It needs to pick it up somehow.

200
00:35:51.970 --> 00:36:07.170
Stephen Curran: What happens to all those cute messages when a wallet disconnects and then disconnects first of all. So now, whoever was handling that whichever instance was handling, it no longer is talking to that wallet, so it can't send it any more messages

201
00:36:07.330 --> 00:36:29.890
Stephen Curran: further. When the wallet reconnects, it may reconnect you know. A minute later or a half a minute later, because it just went out of cell range and then and then switched over to another. You know a a another network instance. Well, it's gonna reconnect, presumably to another instance. And now back instance has to find all those messages.

202
00:36:30.930 --> 00:36:54.420
Stephen Curran: And then, finally, what happens to the queue messages, for instance, shuts down. So an instance is handling the messages. It's it's sending messages along to the the wall. It's it's connected to it. Shut down. All of those messages have to be re-cued, and then or or at least picked up when when the wallets reconnect.

203
00:36:54.510 --> 00:37:19.439
Stephen Curran: So we certainly need to add state. So you know, we've got some sort of table of shared state here that says, Oh, well, you know what one did is currently connected to R, one using web socket, one wallet, 2 is using web socket, 2 on our one. That's a mistake. There. wallet 3 used to be connected to our 2, but then it disappears. So now it's not connected to anything

204
00:37:19.770 --> 00:37:26.689
Stephen Curran: and so on. So some sort of state has to be managed somehow to enable those to pass.

205
00:37:26.910 --> 00:37:29.729
Stephen Curran: and with that I sort of leave it.

206
00:37:30.580 --> 00:37:32.460
Stephen Curran: that

207
00:37:33.090 --> 00:37:44.609
Stephen Curran: I don't have any more, and Ken's got a question or a comment. there's one more problem that would need to be addressed, and that is what happens if there's 2 web sockets for the same wallet connected

208
00:37:46.810 --> 00:37:48.949
Stephen Curran: there. You go? Didn't know that one.

209
00:37:49.930 --> 00:38:01.890
Kim Ebert: And there's a couple of different stories there. That could be handled. It's a more advanced use case. that we could table from now. But it's definitely worth keeping on the

210
00:38:03.890 --> 00:38:06.279
Kim Ebert: on the

211
00:38:06.420 --> 00:38:09.130
Sam Curren (TelegramSam): Stephen you're still sharing. I don't know if you knew that.

212
00:38:12.460 --> 00:38:13.829
Stephen Curran: Steve, you're still

213
00:38:14.060 --> 00:38:18.709
Stephen Curran: there. You go?

214
00:38:19.980 --> 00:38:21.639
Sam Curren (TelegramSam): Rudolfo, your hands up.

215
00:38:22.250 --> 00:38:26.340
Rodolfo Miranda: Yeah, Steven, how you still, instead of using web sockets.

216
00:38:26.700 --> 00:38:33.580
Rodolfo Miranda: they use https with the sort of

217
00:38:34.740 --> 00:38:38.440
Rodolfo Miranda: can can you hear me. I? Yes, we can have San Diego.

218
00:38:38.550 --> 00:38:46.979
Rodolfo Miranda: Okay, using https with it, polling mechanism, or maybe push notifications to go on and find them

219
00:38:47.340 --> 00:38:53.469
Rodolfo Miranda: the messages, because that that maybe you you're gonna buy the web. So that is messy

220
00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:55.340
Rodolfo Miranda: with me and soft wallets.

221
00:38:55.560 --> 00:38:58.259
Sam Curren (TelegramSam): we that is possible.

222
00:38:58.280 --> 00:39:00.140
Sam Curren (TelegramSam): although I

223
00:39:00.260 --> 00:39:05.550
Sam Curren (TelegramSam): We have a a good answer here in a second. So hold that thought.

224
00:39:06.550 --> 00:39:22.080
Sam Curren (TelegramSam):  I think so. I want to hear from from animal. But I happen to know that Stephen asked a bunch of questions, and I know that we had. There's some cool stuff that we would like to share and so I'd love to throw it over to I I don't

225
00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:26.900
Sam Curren (TelegramSam): either either Micah or Colton from the I don't know who is going to be driving.

226
00:39:28.730 --> 00:39:36.790
Micah Peltier: I think I will go ahead and start the conversation, and pass it off to

227
00:39:37.030 --> 00:39:39.669
Micah Peltier: Colton here in a moment.

228
00:39:40.860 --> 00:39:46.030
Micah Peltier: Let me figure out zoom screen share. can everybody see this?

229
00:39:46.340 --> 00:39:48.110
Sam Curren (TelegramSam): Okay, so cool.

230
00:39:48.630 --> 00:39:51.210
Micah Peltier:  so

231
00:39:51.330 --> 00:39:55.660
Micah Peltier: we are talking about a a repo that we have called socket deck

232
00:39:55.680 --> 00:40:00.200
Micah Peltier:  and it's not

233
00:40:00.940 --> 00:40:05.109
Micah Peltier: public just yet, but we'll be making it public here.

234
00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:09.619
Micah Peltier: later. Today. I think we just have a couple of cleanup items

235
00:40:09.700 --> 00:40:13.869
Micah Peltier: before we do that but essentially it's

236
00:40:13.990 --> 00:40:21.830
Micah Peltier: it can be stood up in front of a a cloud based mediator.

237
00:40:22.730 --> 00:40:25.400
Micah Peltier: and what it does is

238
00:40:25.750 --> 00:40:29.989
Micah Peltier: it holds web sockets for

239
00:40:31.670 --> 00:40:35.090
Micah Peltier: arbitrary agents while it's

240
00:40:35.690 --> 00:40:43.029
Micah Peltier: and will forward web socket traffic across Http.

241
00:40:43.260 --> 00:40:48.000
Micah Peltier: you can set up arbitrarily many behind the load. Balancer

242
00:40:48.340 --> 00:40:59.079
Micah Peltier:  the web socket will be associated with a specific instance of socket that And so when when Alice, for example, sends the message

243
00:40:59.290 --> 00:41:02.450
Micah Peltier: up to another connection through the mediator.

244
00:41:02.920 --> 00:41:07.000
Micah Peltier: It'll go to this this first specific instance of socket, doc.

245
00:41:07.460 --> 00:41:12.499
Micah Peltier: and then sock and duck will sort of convert it into an Http message

246
00:41:12.520 --> 00:41:16.070
Micah Peltier: with enough metadata to associate

247
00:41:16.220 --> 00:41:16.910
Micah Peltier: that

248
00:41:17.050 --> 00:41:24.940
Micah Peltier: message. That connection with this specific instance of socket. Doc. so that when the cloud mediator needs to

249
00:41:25.480 --> 00:41:32.540
Micah Peltier: respond to Alice. it knows. Which instance of soccer do you send it to?

250
00:41:46.100 --> 00:41:58.540
Sam Curren (TelegramSam): So I'll highlight that there's no shared state between the socket block instances the state that's necessary is passed alongside the inbound message to the to whatever back end. It is a cloud mediator in this diagram.

251
00:41:58.620 --> 00:42:18.400
Sam Curren (TelegramSam): and then that State includes a back-end Api endpoint that is not run through the load balancer that links to the specific socket Doc instance, so that when a return message is sent. It knows exactly which instance to reach out, to, to pass it over the to the already or the the still connected web socket.

252
00:42:19.350 --> 00:42:27.290
Sam Curren (TelegramSam): so no shared state between socket dock instances means a horizontally scalable without limitation at that level

253
00:42:27.640 --> 00:42:33.170
Micah Peltier: right? And and if Alice were to disconnect and reconnect.

254
00:42:33.420 --> 00:42:39.029
Micah Peltier: you know she wouldn't need to know which instance of, so that she was connected to initially.

255
00:42:39.160 --> 00:42:40.260
Micah Peltier: and so can

256
00:42:40.530 --> 00:42:44.729
Micah Peltier: the the load balancer can can reconnect with any instance of talking about

257
00:42:45.100 --> 00:42:49.330
Micah Peltier: exactly. and and that'll be fine on.

258
00:42:50.380 --> 00:42:52.490
Micah Peltier: And we we

259
00:42:52.550 --> 00:42:58.629
Micah Peltier: recently ran some tests. with this setup and all.

260
00:42:58.700 --> 00:43:04.560
Colton Wolkins: What Before moving on there to the test. I do want to go ahead and add on that

261
00:43:04.760 --> 00:43:08.040
Colton Wolkins: when, because you mentioned when Alice disconnects

262
00:43:08.230 --> 00:43:17.869
Colton Wolkins:  So when Alice disconnects the socket, Doc process. We'll go ahead and send off a message saying, Hey, Alice has disconnected

263
00:43:18.260 --> 00:43:20.780
Colton Wolkins: giving the mediator

264
00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:24.719
Colton Wolkins: a to potentially

265
00:43:25.330 --> 00:43:30.710
Colton Wolkins: start queuing the messages instead of trying to send like forward them on in live delivery mode.

266
00:43:31.240 --> 00:43:32.350
Colton Wolkins: And

267
00:43:32.610 --> 00:43:34.349
Colton Wolkins: Steven, I see your hand up.

268
00:43:36.160 --> 00:43:49.879
Stephen Curran: The the question I have for coming back to that is, is messages coming from other agents going into the mediator. How do those get associated with

269
00:43:51.110 --> 00:43:53.080
Stephen Curran: the dock?

270
00:43:53.280 --> 00:43:54.769
Stephen Curran: The socket talk

271
00:43:55.770 --> 00:43:57.540
Sam Curren (TelegramSam): so they don't.

272
00:43:57.840 --> 00:44:10.539
Stephen Curran: Yeah. So so you're asking the right question, socket Doc doesn't actually care. It does no evaluation of the messages. And so what matters is the software on the other side.

273
00:44:10.610 --> 00:44:30.189
Sam Curren (TelegramSam): So if you are, if you're using socket with an agent, and and you want to keep track of you know which which agent is connected, then, on an inbound message, the first inbound message from that agent you're going to record the the socket dock identifier which basically contains the Uri for a return message.

274
00:44:30.340 --> 00:44:57.630
Sam Curren (TelegramSam):  and it, you're gonna associate that with whoever actually sent the Didcom message that you process socket. Doc doesn't do the processing. which means that if you then want to send a a message back out at any time, whether it's a live delivery mode or just a message that the mediator wants to send. Then it's capable of of looking that up in state in that, and and then when the you'll you'll see there's a post to message, Uri, and a post to disconnect Uri.

275
00:44:57.730 --> 00:45:07.239
Sam Curren (TelegramSam): So when when the socket is disconnected, a a a message just with the disconnect you are I sent to the or or just with the the idea sent to the Cloud Mediator.

276
00:45:07.260 --> 00:45:17.000
Sam Curren (TelegramSam): so that the cloud Mediator, or whatever agent is behind it, is, is capable of cleaning up their state and knowing that that a current socket doesn't yet exist for that.

277
00:45:17.160 --> 00:45:18.280
Sam Curren (TelegramSam): And party

278
00:45:19.440 --> 00:45:39.729
Sam Curren (TelegramSam): does that make sense. So all the State is actually held by whatever agent is behind it. Socket Doc just handles the problem of holding on to the web socket and allowing for messages to be able to be sent back to the back to Alice in this diagrams case. via the the external host and port you know. So send

279
00:45:39.890 --> 00:45:42.699
Sam Curren (TelegramSam): you know. Send you all right. That's actually passed.

280
00:45:43.810 --> 00:45:45.649
Stephen Curran: So basically that

281
00:45:45.870 --> 00:45:48.180
Stephen Curran: diagram that I showed her that

282
00:45:48.260 --> 00:45:54.719
Stephen Curran: trivial table that I just just made it up is basically gonna consist of a wallet did, and a URL.

283
00:45:55.840 --> 00:46:00.989
Sam Curren (TelegramSam): Yes, so we use it as an id. We get the URL and and the URL is

284
00:46:01.050 --> 00:46:11.490
Stephen Curran: go ahead. Sorry.

285
00:46:11.500 --> 00:46:13.639
Stephen Curran: and here is their current.

286
00:46:14.380 --> 00:46:20.610
Stephen Curran:  URL to send them to whenever a message comes in. That's correct.

287
00:46:20.800 --> 00:46:21.610
Stephen Curran: Okay.

288
00:46:21.800 --> 00:46:22.490
yep.

289
00:46:24.110 --> 00:46:52.879
Sam Curren (TelegramSam): So the socket Doc is is is as simple as possible. We say cloud, mediator, or other agent, because Socket Doc doesn't actually care. What is important is that if you have an agent that is receiving messages, it needs to understand the format being sent because it's not just a did come message. It has a little bit of metadata alongside it which contains that that URL which services id for the socket and so there, there may be a little bit of of stuff put in front of it to make that happen.

290
00:46:52.910 --> 00:47:11.249
Sam Curren (TelegramSam): there's the good news is, and that and there's code here on the screen. And again, this will be open later today. so this is what the message actually looks like. There's a there's a metadata that has a struct in it with the call back uris, and then and then the and then the actual messages passed alongside there as well.

291
00:47:13.720 --> 00:47:38.229
Sam Curren (TelegramSam): And so this isn't a lot of code, but it performs a really important role that allows for a an abstraction to occur architecturally speaking, between the maintenance of sockets and the and then a back end processing engine that doesn't have to be capable of sockets at all. That's to have a minor understanding of how to use socket. Do as it's front end, if you will. but that's pretty minor

292
00:47:38.230 --> 00:47:47.039
Sam Curren (TelegramSam): and and everything else. So we've we've had this, and we've used it But we wanted to verify that it performed the way that we hoped it would, and

293
00:47:47.050 --> 00:47:49.140
Sam Curren (TelegramSam): we ran some performance tests

294
00:47:49.480 --> 00:47:56.650
Colton Wolkins: Yup, and and just to clarify like in this scenario here, where you now have the wallets connecting and through socket, Doc.

295
00:47:56.810 --> 00:48:08.759
Colton Wolkins: the wallets. As far as they're concerned, they're still talking to the mediator via web sockets. But now, as the media, as far as the mediator is concerned, it is only communicating via Http get or

296
00:48:08.890 --> 00:48:11.779
Colton Wolkins: Acd post requests inbound and outbound

297
00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:21.460
John Jordan: Now moving on to the performance. Metrics that say, I mentioned, if one of the instances of socket doc fails.

298
00:48:23.830 --> 00:48:25.440
John Jordan: what happens?

299
00:48:25.910 --> 00:48:31.619
Kim Ebert: If it fails, then all of those agents will need to reconnect there by associating

300
00:48:31.690 --> 00:48:36.129
Kim Ebert: their new web socket with the new

301
00:48:36.220 --> 00:48:38.730
Kim Ebert: a mapping inside the cloud mediator.

302
00:48:39.230 --> 00:48:42.929
John Jordan: Right? So. But their state, I guess, is held by the mediator. So

303
00:48:43.360 --> 00:48:44.830
John Jordan: no problem.

304
00:48:45.270 --> 00:48:58.180
Colton Wolkins: then the posts would fail right, the posts would fail. So if the socket Doc came back up and we tried to post a message. But Alice was no longer associated with this socket. Doc. Instance, here

305
00:48:58.240 --> 00:49:04.870
Colton Wolkins: the post to socket, Doc would fail. saying, Hey, we don't have that guy connected to us

306
00:49:04.980 --> 00:49:12.370
Colton Wolkins: which point the cloud mediator would say, Oh, hey! My post failed. I need to queue that message instead

307
00:49:14.040 --> 00:49:16.260
John Jordan: and wait for her or you to connect.

308
00:49:17.060 --> 00:49:17.870
Sam Curren (TelegramSam): Yep.

309
00:49:18.330 --> 00:49:19.100
John Jordan: okay.

310
00:49:24.280 --> 00:49:30.320
Colton Wolkins: So we we ran a few tests. Just kind of scaling up the system this test here

311
00:49:30.470 --> 00:49:34.370
Colton Wolkins: we ran it with 3,000 users.

312
00:49:35.350 --> 00:49:40.069
Colton Wolkins: just to see how it would perform. And we were getting just you know.

313
00:49:40.410 --> 00:49:43.389
Colton Wolkins: the user. All these users are just

314
00:49:43.520 --> 00:49:50.929
Colton Wolkins: establishing a connection to the mediator and then doing a ping, a continual ping every about minute or 2

315
00:49:51.750 --> 00:49:57.070
Colton Wolkins: to the mediator, and we noticed that there weren't really any failures.

316
00:49:57.500 --> 00:50:04.390
Colton Wolkins: and everything was going smoothly. So we changed from her, and the system

317
00:50:04.900 --> 00:50:08.639
Colton Wolkins: use on both the nodes was fairly minimal.

318
00:50:09.080 --> 00:50:16.689
Kim Ebert: So what you're indicating here, Colton, is that we have 2 socket Doc nodes in front of the cloud mediator of some type.

319
00:50:16.720 --> 00:50:19.539
Colton Wolkins: Yes, and actually. So what we're doing here

320
00:50:19.750 --> 00:50:26.329
Colton Wolkins: we have the Amazon aws load balancer in front of 2

321
00:50:26.440 --> 00:50:29.160
Colton Wolkins: t 2

322
00:50:29.470 --> 00:50:32.550
Colton Wolkins: micro nodes which have 1 GB of RAM.

323
00:50:35.790 --> 00:50:45.669
Colton Wolkins: And so we, we're currently just doing using. They're performing these tests with these 2 nodes. And then we have a cloud mediator behind that right? Okay?

324
00:50:48.040 --> 00:50:55.460
Colton Wolkins: And so fairly minimal RAM usage and CPU usage here throughout that test.

325
00:50:55.570 --> 00:50:59.389
Colton Wolkins: Next up, we decided to bump up the numbers by quite a bit.

326
00:51:00.070 --> 00:51:04.009
Colton Wolkins: and we bumped up the number of users to

327
00:51:04.410 --> 00:51:06.540
Colton Wolkins: 10,000 users

328
00:51:07.660 --> 00:51:12.639
Colton Wolkins: the the drop here is because we were

329
00:51:12.900 --> 00:51:27.400
Kim Ebert: so. I actually think that this is a statistics issue with a 95 percentile to take into account the pings. the 95 percentile here includes the Aj Startup time.

330
00:51:27.810 --> 00:51:34.070
Kim Ebert: but as soon as you have enough pings that may cause the 95% tile to drop lower there.

331
00:51:34.280 --> 00:51:38.049
Kim Ebert: and so that's new, just to

332
00:51:38.310 --> 00:51:41.110
Kim Ebert: a statistic. a function.

333
00:51:41.960 --> 00:51:47.660
Colton Wolkins: I I also thought that the drop off was due to the fact that we were starting up those

334
00:51:47.830 --> 00:51:52.530
Colton Wolkins: Afj agents or wallets in this case.

335
00:51:53.210 --> 00:52:01.340
Colton Wolkins: we slowed down the spin up just due to a limitation on the

336
00:52:01.550 --> 00:52:10.830
Kim Ebert: best machine of the test machine itself that was sending these requests out.  was due to a CPU limitation.

337
00:52:12.030 --> 00:52:17.030
Kim Ebert: But again, it's a statistic issue. If you look up above at the percent tiles

338
00:52:17.090 --> 00:52:29.870
Kim Ebert: inside of the different functions here. you'll see that the ping stayed relatively consistent. and the on start time was relatively consistent. If you look at the different percentiles here.

339
00:52:32.180 --> 00:52:34.039
Colton Wolkins: And the startup

340
00:52:34.370 --> 00:52:40.099
Colton Wolkins: was dragging that percentile way up compared to where the ping.

341
00:52:43.190 --> 00:52:46.970
Colton Wolkins: And again, like 10,000 users.

342
00:52:47.180 --> 00:52:53.360
Colton Wolkins: no big deal. We're still going ahead and handling everything, all those socket communications

343
00:52:53.560 --> 00:52:55.539
Colton Wolkins: being load balanced.

344
00:52:55.690 --> 00:52:57.989
Colton Wolkins: And we're still.

345
00:52:58.070 --> 00:53:06.679
Colton Wolkins: We're only at 436 MB RAM usage on these 2 nodes. CPU usage is still relatively small.

346
00:53:06.840 --> 00:53:11.279
Colton Wolkins: so we decided to bump it up even further to

347
00:53:11.540 --> 00:53:19.179
Colton Wolkins:  12,500 simultaneously connected users over web sockets.

348
00:53:20.750 --> 00:53:23.630
Colton Wolkins: all of those ping still.

349
00:53:23.960 --> 00:53:29.480
Colton Wolkins: for all intents and purposes, chugging along just fine across these 2

350
00:53:29.900 --> 00:53:37.250
Colton Wolkins: load balanced T. 2 micro instances on Amazon. and

351
00:53:37.760 --> 00:53:44.579
Colton Wolkins: our RAM usage is still below 500 MB on both of these 2 nodes, and our CPU usage

352
00:53:44.780 --> 00:53:48.910
Colton Wolkins: with these active pings, is still relatively small.

353
00:53:50.340 --> 00:53:53.730
Colton Wolkins: And so what this means is that

354
00:53:54.460 --> 00:54:00.340
Colton Wolkins: all of these agents, they are all of these agents that we have connected, and running these pings.

355
00:54:00.610 --> 00:54:01.950
Colton Wolkins: They are

356
00:54:02.090 --> 00:54:06.549
Colton Wolkins: live active agents, in a sense, just waiting for messages.

357
00:54:06.580 --> 00:54:18.559
Colton Wolkins: and so, if they were mobile agents, this would be like 12,500 people all at once, just opening the app and having it open on their screen. As soon as they would close the app, it would

358
00:54:18.740 --> 00:54:21.179
Colton Wolkins: close that web socket communication.

359
00:54:21.620 --> 00:54:23.519
Colton Wolkins: but

360
00:54:23.570 --> 00:54:30.910
Colton Wolkins: our tests here are without that whole close of the app. These are all active web socket connections.

361
00:54:34.860 --> 00:54:55.229
Sam Curren (TelegramSam): So Charles got to begin a question why the focus on web sockets? It shouldn't be transport agnostic. A mediator could use smtp the the preferred. The reason why it's preferred for mobile agents is that you want a message to arrive really soon without necessarily pulling. You can also rely on on push notifications for this.

362
00:54:55.500 --> 00:55:11.179
Sam Curren (TelegramSam): but when you're if the if the app is open, the likelihood that the person is going to be receiving a message goes up substantially as opposed to any other time, which means that maintaining a live web socket connection produces a really really fast user experience for inbound messages.

363
00:55:11.180 --> 00:55:28.100
Sam Curren (TelegramSam): but we've had a challenge up to this point about scaling the number of web sockets that you can maintain easily. so these t 2 macro instances a cost 10 bucks a month on. Aws, I I've realized on different platforms that will be different. But just to give you kind of a sense of

364
00:55:28.100 --> 00:55:29.339
Sam Curren (TelegramSam): what the cost is.

365
00:55:29.610 --> 00:55:36.600
Sam Curren (TelegramSam): And and we're making an educated guess that that at this point we can support 10 1,000

366
00:55:36.730 --> 00:55:55.199
Sam Curren (TelegramSam):  sockets per t, 2 micro instance given this behavior, obviously, some, some more real world experience will be helpful in and evaluating that number. But we, we feel like this is a really great way to cost effectively provide that that connected web socket experience. Kim.

367
00:55:55.600 --> 00:55:58.550
Kim Ebert: I did want to mention that. the

368
00:55:58.760 --> 00:56:08.750
Kim Ebert: low testing could go much higher. It was a limitation of the low testing configuration at the time. not the micro instances or the cloud mediator.

369
00:56:09.230 --> 00:56:26.539
Sam Curren (TelegramSam): Yes, totally. We. We had a single instance driving this and we have the capability of doing clustered test driving boxes. And that's what we'll need to do to to drive it above that we were running a very large instance to to run this number of sockets. and and what was happening, and that test, by the way Kim mentioned this was using afg underneath.

370
00:56:26.580 --> 00:56:51.089
Sam Curren (TelegramSam): So unfortunately, we have, like 1 min left. this has been fantastic. but hopefully. So this falls Steven, into your your relay in the in the diagrams that you were showing and can and can perform that relay really really well, and it doesn't care what's behind it. It can actually feed those messages, of course, into into a queuing system, or any other mechanism that would be useful for that.

371
00:56:51.190 --> 00:57:01.340
Sam Curren (TelegramSam): and we also have a proxy mediator that that that that Kim just dropped a link to that allows. This is what we use to avoid the the

372
00:57:02.460 --> 00:57:03.550
Sam Curren (TelegramSam): oh, shoot!

373
00:57:03.670 --> 00:57:27.869
Sam Curren (TelegramSam): I just blinked on this. Oh, you can see this openly later today. We almost had it open. it! I think it would work with as the mediator as long as Afj was able to process the inbound posts, so there may be a tiny shim in front of that of that teamo in order to use afj as that. the, there's no, there's no pre processing of the Didcom message is done. It's just that we're posting that with some additional metadata.

374
00:57:27.960 --> 00:57:29.609
Sam Curren (TelegramSam): so really quick

375
00:57:29.920 --> 00:57:44.229
Sam Curren (TelegramSam): in the agenda. there is a link that I that I need to share, because we need review on it. Timo has produced a a a legacy. Did transformation document that needs review and so that we can use this.

376
00:57:44.510 --> 00:58:03.660
Sam Curren (TelegramSam): the proposals that we use this as a way of of transitioning off of the legacy. Did given sort of what was pioneered inside of a J, and so teamo created this, this does need review and we could bring it up and talk about it online. And in our next meeting. but I wanted to highlight that as well. we will be posting the socket, Doc

377
00:58:03.660 --> 00:58:28.650
Sam Curren (TelegramSam): repo link inside of the the area channels on discord. and for your perusal. And we would love some questions. Feedback bug issues all of those other things. if the community is acceptable to it. We would. We can transfer that repo into the Hyper Ledger organization. it'll first be made public as a as an in Dco repository. with the license file, etc., in there. But But we we would love to transfer

378
00:58:28.650 --> 00:58:32.809
Sam Curren (TelegramSam): for that. We just want to make sure that it's desirable by the community to do so.

379
00:58:33.860 --> 00:58:48.689
Sam Curren (TelegramSam): and I apologize for going over But thank you. And we can talk about this, and then pre, please reach out Colton and and Micah are the are the experts on this code, and and they'd be happy to to answer any questions. They are also on discord.

380
00:58:49.850 --> 00:58:52.519
Sam Curren (TelegramSam): any any final comments, since we're 2 min over.

381
00:58:53.730 --> 00:58:55.640
John Jordan: Great stuff. Thank you.

382
00:58:56.480 --> 00:58:59.540
Stephen Curran: Fantastic, awesome work.

383
00:58:59.700 --> 00:59:00.750
Stephen Curran: you know.

384
00:59:01.080 --> 00:59:02.170
Timo Glastra: Thanks. Everyone.
