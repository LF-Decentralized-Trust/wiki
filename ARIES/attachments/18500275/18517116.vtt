00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:35.570
Hakan: Hello!

2
00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:38.960
Rodolfo Miranda: Hello!

3
00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:40.459
Hakan: How are you doing?

4
00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:41.980
Rodolfo Miranda: Good? Good.

5
00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:42.910
Rodolfo Miranda: Right?

6
00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.200
Judith HÃ¶gerl: Hello! How are you that?

7
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.679
Rodolfo Miranda: Hello! Is it?

8
00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.230
Hakan: Do you know if Lens is going to join us today.

9
00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.340
Rodolfo Miranda: I'm gonna thank him. You should.

10
00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:01.000
Rodolfo Miranda: So we are Didn't Response.

11
00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:06.310
Hakan: Yeah.

12
00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:07.340
Nice.

13
00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:10.770
Rodolfo Miranda: I lands.

14
00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:25.250
Lance Byrd: hey? Sorry, folks I have a bunch of workers at the house, and well, let's just say nothing's going right with it. And yeah, I I had a meeting, and then I forgot, as they were telling me all my horror stories.

15
00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:31.999
Lance Byrd: All right. It's great to see you. Sorry for the delay. let's see. Are we recording?

16
00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:42.769
Lance Byrd: Hmm. I'll record, I guess. Hey, Judith, already already recording. Okay? Oh, that's right.

17
00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:55.690
Lance Byrd: Okay. So let's see. well, 2 things that I just added to the spreadsheet or just the Pr's from the 2 different projects. so

18
00:04:55.890 --> 00:05:01.439
Lance Byrd: there's the big one for Afgh. let's see here sheets

19
00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:05.440
Lance Byrd: and Aries did come V 2,

20
00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:09.690
Lance Byrd: and I need to share my screen.

21
00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:15.800
Lance Byrd: Not that not that I'm. Showing you anything

22
00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:20.759
Lance Byrd: fantastic here, but it's always good to revisit the

23
00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:22.580
Lance Byrd: spreadsheet.

24
00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:27.219
Lance Byrd: okay. So

25
00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:45.550
Lance Byrd: Yeah, let's see. I had it there. But really I'm changing this interoperability page, it's gonna have to change a a bunch eventually. But under projects I added, these related Pr's. So in hawk on, and Judith they're doing the occupy stuff

26
00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:48.959
Lance Byrd: for issue credential and present proof V 3.

27
00:05:49.010 --> 00:06:04.930
Lance Byrd: And then there's in the ongoing you know, massive integration. one pr for dig company, 2 in a Fj. and then they have a also a. Pr. Related to like the mediator functionality

28
00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:13.110
Lance Byrd: in a. So I added those to the spreadsheet. I guess i'll just post the link to this again, just in case

29
00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:15.799
Lance Byrd: or posterity.

30
00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:19.900
Oh.

31
00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:25.229
Hakan: yeah, Can Can you share this spreadsheets with

32
00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:28.439
Hakan: us as well? I'm not sure if I was in the list.

33
00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:30.390
Lance Byrd: Yeah, sure. Let me. Yes.

34
00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:36.420
Lance Byrd: Oh, yeah, I could put you. I could put you in the share, and then also post the link. Let's see. Do I have you.

35
00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:51.570
Lance Byrd: I might not have your email. Let me post the link. Anyone with the link can can view it. Alright, and comment. And if you, if you end up wanting to be an editor, I can you, if you just send me your of course email I'll

36
00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:59.989
Lance Byrd: I sorry I just have to figure out how there we go. My chat always disappears as soon as I become the

37
00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:15.619
Lance Byrd: the host here, or go full screen. Okay. Yep. So there's the there's the sheets. again. The idea just real quick is that we want to essentially document projects within Aries that have ongoing didcom stuff.

38
00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:35.500
Lance Byrd: We want to track the implementations that are out there that could be related or could be used so like we've even added Barama, which nobody's using in Aries that I know of, but right it could be something interesting and useful, and certainly we would want to eventually know kind of interoperability with those, so that this page, the interoperability page, should.

39
00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:47.499
Lance Byrd: hopefully, you know, be refactored and kind of take into account the projects the implementations. I added, did methods just because without the corresponding did methods. we can't do

40
00:07:47.630 --> 00:08:05.780
Lance Byrd: like did peer together, and things like that. this is the Aries agent test harness tests that are somewhat related. I'm still going through that stuff, although I've had to pause on it recently. and then obviously protocols that that that could be supported.

41
00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:15.880
Lance Byrd: Crypto issues references. Has the Jf. Stuff in it right now. Any other links that we want to add that that might give us some good information. and then

42
00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:22.100
Lance Byrd: i'd forgotten about this questions. One interrupt profiles. Do we need a lightweight alternative to we? He did come. that was something that

43
00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:33.500
Lance Byrd: that we had wanted to consider. So anyways, yeah, we feel free. We can add more sheets or whatever, and then eventually come up with a nice interoperability.

44
00:08:34.679 --> 00:08:35.740
Lance Byrd: Tab.

45
00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:37.830
Hakan: Yeah.

46
00:08:37.890 --> 00:08:44.800
Hakan: that sounds very good. So I think, during our last call I also mentioned we would so come up with a

47
00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:50.409
Hakan: Yeah, a a draft of any kind of an interoperability profile. The things that we will need to

48
00:08:50.650 --> 00:08:55.790
Hakan: either include from the previous areas in top profiles or

49
00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.469
Hakan: yeah, upgrade updates from them. Basically.

50
00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:14.769
Hakan: So yeah, I I did that. I didn't know. I I mean, I knew that there was a spreadsheet, but I didn't know that we wanted to put the profile here as well. So I put it on a different sheet. If you guys want to review it, or like Have a conversation about it.

51
00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:17.140
Hakan: yeah, we can do so.

52
00:09:18.250 --> 00:09:36.040
Lance Byrd: And I'm: I'm: 100% open to we could do it as a spreadsheet. We could do it as this documents I'm flexible. If if people have preferences of how best to track this. I think it is pretty good, so far, so I I guess we can put them in in the spreadsheet.

53
00:09:36.250 --> 00:09:45.960
Lance Byrd: Okay? And then yeah, let's go through this together. You can kind of guide us through it. And so if you can go to the very bottom of the

54
00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:51.819
Hakan: yeah. So this is where it starts. Basically. Can you scroll up a bit further.

55
00:09:52.490 --> 00:09:53.779
Hakan: a bit more.

56
00:09:53.930 --> 00:09:58.139
Hakan: a little bit more, and that's a bit more

57
00:09:58.390 --> 00:10:10.579
Hakan: yeah perfect. So this is where it starts. So basically I'm: i'm pretty sure you also came up with the areas into a profile page on. I think it's one of the features

58
00:10:10.690 --> 00:10:18.089
Hakan: I I I left the link there. Yeah, it's a concept. So 3 o 2 areas into a profile. So

59
00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:20.190
Hakan: well, I I didn't put

60
00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:27.369
Hakan: a lot of new things I just put took the one that we had from the areas in top of the profile 2

61
00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:34.390
Hakan: and started commenting on them, and like saying like, are there going to be any necessities to

62
00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:37.080
Hakan: change anything that are existing?

63
00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:56.949
Hakan: Or are we going to need new protocols? Because this is exactly what happened with the upgrade from Mary's intel profile. 1 point oh, to 2 point. Oh, so they basically took the list from 1 point. Oh, extended with the 2 point all stuff, and took a look if they needed to change something if they wanted to drop it if they wanted to.

64
00:10:57.780 --> 00:10:59.890
Hakan: yeah up to upgrade it. Basically

65
00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:04.979
Hakan: and yeah. So if you go down a bit lower, you will see the same

66
00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:11.009
Hakan: structure. Basically. So tutorials of targets.

67
00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:19.250
Hakan: Yeah. So this is where it stuff. So basically we have the Aip V one and those for the set of Rfcs

68
00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:22.410
Hakan: that for meant to be a part of it.

69
00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:26.100
Hakan: So this this made the interpreter for one.

70
00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:36.530
Hakan: Okay? And then what happened is basically they made an upgrade to it. So they said, okay, these were the ones coming from a a IP to 1.0

71
00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:38.250
Hakan: and

72
00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:46.210
Hakan: basically the same features have been taken and taken into consideration. How to

73
00:11:47.230 --> 00:11:53.860
Hakan: What is it going to be discontinued, upgraded or used, as it were, before, basically.

74
00:11:54.210 --> 00:11:56.800
Hakan: and that comes a bit a lower.

75
00:11:58.900 --> 00:11:59.930
Hakan: that list.

76
00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:06.319
Hakan: So so this is this: is exactly it. So

77
00:12:06.570 --> 00:12:16.149
Hakan: Yeah, there are some notes with basically reformatted minimal updates. It's updated, etc. So taking basically things that for a part of a IP, one

78
00:12:16.370 --> 00:12:28.170
Hakan: came with a couple of upgrades, basically and then edit new stuff like see? For example, goal codes is new. did exchanges new did compile and mime types are new.

79
00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:32.580
Hakan: etc. So I think it's yeah, more or less

80
00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:45.260
Hakan: a visible step from what was IP. A. IP. One? What is a IP 2 point. Oh, then there are some other things like with the mediators, and like encryption envelopes that have been added as well.

81
00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:47.740
Hakan: So

82
00:12:47.950 --> 00:12:50.010
Hakan: I just took basically this list

83
00:12:51.770 --> 00:12:58.540
Hakan: and starts it to go through it one by one, to see whether we're going to

84
00:12:58.580 --> 00:12:59.810
Hakan: use them.

85
00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:03.179
Hakan: Update them, or just drop them

86
00:13:03.510 --> 00:13:06.040
Hakan: for a. I. P. 3,

87
00:13:06.530 --> 00:13:12.069
Hakan: and that is the one that is visible in that word to you. yeah, Google sheets basically.

88
00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:17.090
Hakan: Yeah. So

89
00:13:19.370 --> 00:13:25.509
Hakan: the question is whether it's going to call it aip 3 point or not. But this is, I think, something that

90
00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:29.230
Hakan: going to. Yeah, we can think about it.

91
00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:37.870
Lance Byrd: It seems to have strong support from Steven and Sam. So the currents that are unrelated. But

92
00:13:38.530 --> 00:13:51.169
Lance Byrd: yeah, I mean I, You know this is one of those things like. At what point do we just say, Yes, we're doing aip 3.0. I I would vote that we just go ahead at this point and say, a IP 3 is

93
00:13:51.180 --> 00:14:02.089
Lance Byrd: is happening. I mean that this is fantastic. What you're doing, and then they seem to support that idea. It it seems to be kind of like. Well, what do you want to do? But I think at this point that would be

94
00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:13.000
Lance Byrd: because of the legacy, and and how much people know about it. and you know we've kind of floated the idea past our customers. And I I just think that

95
00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:23.409
Lance Byrd: the community community can really rally around the the concept of an of a new aip that's did come. V. 2 related because anyone who's

96
00:14:23.950 --> 00:14:42.830
Lance Byrd: kind of thought like oh, aip 2, you know. Does that include? Did come, and they start digging, or did come v 2, and they they start digging into it, and then they're like it's not really. And yeah, so I I feel like this would be like some solid ground for the community to just say Yes, that's the point a IP 3 did come V. 2,

97
00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:47.090
Rodolfo Miranda: So my my question is, if we support, for example, we support

98
00:14:47.290 --> 00:14:49.630
Rodolfo Miranda: I. P. 3 a 3.

99
00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:54.109
Rodolfo Miranda: Should we support the children. So if we are in 3,

100
00:14:55.220 --> 00:14:57.930
Rodolfo Miranda: do we need to support it? It can be one

101
00:14:59.050 --> 00:15:13.259
Hakan: that wasn't the case with aip, 2.0 to 1 point. Oh, right if if we see yeah because of the interdependency frameworks such as go, for example, before the in the SDK binding of go.

102
00:15:13.270 --> 00:15:27.960
Hakan: They did not support anything related to India. That's why I don't think it's a necessity to support one. But if there is a need of backwards comfortability. Or if you're just moving on with, for example, a Akapi or

103
00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:33.310
Hakan: framework, javascript, then, yeah, in that case it's just gonna be at addition, and

104
00:15:33.870 --> 00:15:35.010
Hakan: not necessarily.

105
00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:46.039
Rodolfo Miranda: Yeah, that's so in in in that, in that in that leads did it conversion? It's not. It's not there, right? Or it is

106
00:15:46.050 --> 00:16:00.789
Hakan: not in this one. That's why, for example, if you look at to the feature 0, 0, 19 encryption envelope. I just noted that it is not required for a IP 3 point, all because that is the all the encryption envelope use for did come V: One.

107
00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:03.610
Rodolfo Miranda: Okay, got it.

108
00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:08.989
Lance Byrd: and I I I really like that concept. I'm so glad you brought that over to, because

109
00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:18.820
Lance Byrd: that is the problem with legacy right? If you always have to carry all of the legacy, you know, into the new aip.

110
00:16:19.060 --> 00:16:29.090
Lance Byrd: Then I don't think it will ever get done right, because it just becomes such a burden and and people are already complaining that, did come V 2 is.

111
00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:34.570
Lance Byrd: It has quite a wide scope, and it takes a lot in order to implement it. So.

112
00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:52.760
Lance Byrd: yeah, my preference is, and I I Honestly, I I was not familiar with this process. How kind i'm so glad that you kind of listed this out the way that you have it. It's excellent. But yeah, my my inclination is that if we can make a IP 3 as light as possible.

113
00:16:52.770 --> 00:16:59.269
Lance Byrd: and then with people having the option to go support a IP, you know 2. If they want

114
00:16:59.490 --> 00:17:02.089
Lance Byrd: that, that would be a major advantage for us.

115
00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:04.420
Rodolfo Miranda: Yeah, because you you can support any.

116
00:17:04.510 --> 00:17:11.349
Rodolfo Miranda: because I think they accept message. You. You put that the one it'd be 2 to 3.

117
00:17:11.450 --> 00:17:25.800
Alex: I have a quick question, guys. So i'm looking at the different like proposals, and like the different art of season there. And i'm seeing that there are like technical rfcs, as well as like application related. I've c's as well as like

118
00:17:25.839 --> 00:17:28.069
Alex: sub-

119
00:17:28.119 --> 00:17:35.799
Alex: so i'm trying to figure out what's the purpose of like a profile and like in this case, because, like there's like Jason Ld. Support like static Peer did

120
00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:36.970
like

121
00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:45.729
Alex: Presentation Exchange, or like. If you support a specific context like the attachment. So i'm trying to figure out, how can we scope this one

122
00:17:46.050 --> 00:17:47.300
Alex: so

123
00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:52.450
Alex: there, cause I can try to figure out like exactly what are we trying to put in a profile? Does that make sense?

124
00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:55.920
Lance Byrd: yeah, totally.

125
00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:59.460
Hakan: It makes sense. No, no, it's

126
00:17:59.950 --> 00:18:19.750
Hakan: So I I I think you ask a legitimate question, because, the thing is, we have discount. V 2, and discomfort is basically for agents to communicate with each other. There is like an encryption envelope. So in the in the in the most basic we need to be able to do a did exchange. We need to be able to, use the same

127
00:18:19.770 --> 00:18:49.690
Hakan: encryption envelope, or like key exchange with you. Defy Herman use the same yeah message structure. But, for example, things like, for example, the Jason Ld. Attachments, or or Bbs, plus, or or or and on Crest, or whatever so those i'm. I'm. Also like this is something that we will have to talk about as well, because they those are actually like payloads in the did convey to message, and not necessarily related to, did convey

128
00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:50.990
as a as a

129
00:18:51.140 --> 00:18:52.530
Hakan: protocol.

130
00:18:53.110 --> 00:19:08.099
Alex: right? Right? Right? And like you get to exchange that information, and like the presentation exchange like you can see like what what credentials you support, and all that gets done at a different level. Then, like a interrupt profile, I would say, yeah, but this is exactly what we will have to think about, because

131
00:19:08.170 --> 00:19:08.830
like

132
00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:19.809
Hakan: so, this has actually been sold with Bucky right? They they they just like extended it more than to did commute today, they said, okay, we're going to use it as the basic. But then, on top of it.

133
00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:31.279
Hakan: we're going to use bbs plus as a credentials, or it's it's like use. The the presentation Exchange protocol attachment type for present proof, v. 3 that they also specified. So

134
00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:47.889
Hakan: maybe the way forward is to call this savaki profile. It's. It's also possible, like because just having just having the bare minimum is not going to cover, because we will need to find out like whether we support the Jason Ld. Whether we support an on credits in these.

135
00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:49.080
Hakan: Probably

136
00:19:49.910 --> 00:19:56.180
Hakan: not, or it it it's it's really on the air. Basically so this is the part that you'll also come up with as well, I think.

137
00:19:57.540 --> 00:20:16.370
Alex: Got it. Yeah, I guess like something I was curious about like right now we're using. I see that we're using agents only for like issuing credential and like presenting credential. So I was hoping that maybe like would they come? Be 2 protocols? We can have like more application related protocols, like at the same like issue, present proof, credential

138
00:20:16.380 --> 00:20:21.370
Alex: and like, we can have like, yeah, like group chat, or like chat messages and like stuff like that.

139
00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:30.259
Alex: and like interesting, how we can communicate about like exchanging those like protocols as Well, I think it would be something useful to do in the IP 3.

140
00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:31.080
Yeah.

141
00:20:32.690 --> 00:20:36.699
Hakan: that's that's also a legit. So parts

142
00:20:36.870 --> 00:20:42.889
Hakan: we we do have the basic messaging. I see if you scroll down a bit for, but I mean you probably saw it anyway.

143
00:20:42.910 --> 00:20:44.799
Hakan: So we will need to.

144
00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:49.259
Hakan: probably updated according to the

145
00:20:52.530 --> 00:21:00.799
Alex: Yeah. And then, like, I think routing is also almost big. Then they can be, too, as well. So maybe we can get rid of those.

146
00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:01.810
Alex: Oh.

147
00:21:01.970 --> 00:21:07.509
Alex: yeah, yeah, Thank you so much for all the work like I

148
00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:18.199
Hakan: it it. It also needs a lot of discussions like what we want to include, and what we don't want to include. For example, I did realize it. I made a mistake with like, including in the attachments. Because

149
00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:30.049
Hakan: do we really want the in the dependency coming into a I. P 3 point all or not. I don't know we we need to be careful, maybe, about

150
00:21:30.130 --> 00:21:31.610
Hakan: making that statement

151
00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:34.760
Lance Byrd: if we can avoid it. I would love to.

152
00:21:35.010 --> 00:21:37.529
Rodolfo Miranda: Yeah, I mean, Minimal. Yeah, because

153
00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:39.470
Rodolfo Miranda: the way that you can.

154
00:21:40.580 --> 00:21:46.540
Rodolfo Miranda: I think that we used to use the the profile as incremental, like the one IP 2, and

155
00:21:47.310 --> 00:21:52.750
Rodolfo Miranda: the the latest is the best. But I think we can compose like find a minimum.

156
00:21:52.780 --> 00:22:02.180
Rodolfo Miranda: Or did it come? Be 2 like like this, one basic stuff. And then, if you want to support in the other, it can be another profile, right, and you can compose

157
00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:04.070
Rodolfo Miranda: with several.

158
00:22:04.290 --> 00:22:05.439
Rodolfo Miranda: That's just

159
00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:08.290
Hakan: that. That could be a possibility to yeah.

160
00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:10.029
Hakan: So extended.

161
00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:11.380
Rodolfo Miranda: Yeah.

162
00:22:12.550 --> 00:22:16.440
Rodolfo Miranda: this is

163
00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:20.419
Lance Byrd: no. I I was just going to say that this is such an interesting

164
00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:24.759
Lance Byrd: moment. Because, yeah, these aips have been

165
00:22:25.750 --> 00:22:32.820
Lance Byrd: these kind of like, I mean, the goal right is that these agents can just interrupt. But,

166
00:22:33.790 --> 00:22:50.090
Lance Byrd: The variety of ways to interrupt is becoming so great that it's hard to imagine. Yeah, aip 3 right being all encompassing, especially now that the Ares world is untying itself from

167
00:22:50.770 --> 00:22:52.129
Lance Byrd: Indy.

168
00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:53.000
Hakan: Yeah.

169
00:22:53.920 --> 00:23:12.029
Lance Byrd: And yeah, so exactly which Hawkins saying, roto, saying, Alex is is saying like, what is it that composes this thing? Because that's such a hard question to answer. I like what Hawkins saying about maybe calling it aip wacky.

170
00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:13.950
Lance Byrd: But then

171
00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:21.929
Lance Byrd: I I would just love to talk a little bit about that in terms of thoughts of

172
00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:29.280
Lance Byrd: Then what is the aip providing that the kind of wacky specification, isn't providing?

173
00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:33.599
Lance Byrd: And does that kind of give us a hint at our scope

174
00:23:36.030 --> 00:23:36.910
Lance Byrd: thoughts?

175
00:23:37.090 --> 00:23:37.940
Hakan: So

176
00:23:38.490 --> 00:23:41.980
Hakan: my my! To this vaccine is a

177
00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:56.430
Hakan: work that has been done in a collaboration between diff and hyper ledger. and the results was basically vaki. As a specification, however, we need a clear

178
00:23:58.140 --> 00:24:00.029
Hakan: concepts and features

179
00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:04.379
Hakan: that needs to be implemented by the Ares frameworks

180
00:24:04.630 --> 00:24:08.099
Hakan: to be compatible with Baki as a profile.

181
00:24:08.330 --> 00:24:10.139
Hakan: And I think our

182
00:24:10.930 --> 00:24:22.699
Hakan: call in in in here is, if you choose to go back here. I mean, this is also still like an on on the air. But if if you do so, and I I think it looks very similar.

183
00:24:23.210 --> 00:24:23.770
Hakan: but

184
00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:43.620
Hakan: then we have to align with the credential type, which is Bbs, because it's a part of lucky. But if you say yes. Okay, this is the way forward. in that case, I think this working group can be a part of defining the features and concepts Rfc's that are required to fulfill as a spec.

185
00:24:44.210 --> 00:24:49.900
Rodolfo Miranda: So how is it working? Only tied to bbs plus? Or I think it's

186
00:24:50.140 --> 00:25:03.239
Hakan: yeah, all next up it's. It's it's it's a like in vacuum. I'm: i'm going to check this again. But well, that's

187
00:25:03.710 --> 00:25:06.970
Rodolfo Miranda: like in the

188
00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:11.130
Hakan: well you can do India as well. Okay, I thought it was

189
00:25:11.230 --> 00:25:16.310
Hakan: on to the bbs plus. I thought this. This is what they aligned on. When

190
00:25:16.780 --> 00:25:26.980
Alex: I think you can use the different like credential types, like.

191
00:25:27.690 --> 00:25:32.660
Alex: Okay, in that case.

192
00:25:33.660 --> 00:25:34.430
Hakan: Yeah.

193
00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:37.170
Alex: But then again.

194
00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:42.670
Hakan: it's it's very important to the distinction, because, like Indie has one implementation.

195
00:25:42.940 --> 00:25:48.200
Hakan: If you take in the you have to take the libraries that come with it.

196
00:25:49.510 --> 00:25:51.270
Hakan: yeah.

197
00:25:53.970 --> 00:26:03.179
Alex: yeah. I was gonna say that, in my opinion, like the walkie profile like it's an extremely like complex, but like aip. And there's a lot of things to implement at that level

198
00:26:03.270 --> 00:26:12.139
Alex: like like having tried to do that, and having to support all the different like message types, all the different, like context of different credentials.

199
00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:14.600
Alex: It's like a piece of work in and of itself.

200
00:26:14.770 --> 00:26:27.620
Alex: and they like they define like a lot of things on how to exchange credentials like in that specification. So I guess, what i'm trying to figure out like with an aip like. Do we want to have

201
00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:34.179
Alex: similar protocols like that that you can exchange, like other type of information like messages, group messages?

202
00:26:34.210 --> 00:26:38.079
Alex: Or do we just want it to be focused on like credential exchange, and

203
00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:38.970
Alex: like

204
00:26:39.220 --> 00:26:42.020
Alex: everything that's related with all of that?

205
00:26:42.590 --> 00:26:44.770
Alex: Or do we leave that at the Walkie Level?

206
00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:48.710
Because, like.

207
00:26:48.820 --> 00:26:53.100
Alex: yeah, like, I think, like even like it did come interoperability

208
00:26:53.170 --> 00:26:56.849
Alex: with Brian and Dewala and snore like we tried to like.

209
00:26:56.900 --> 00:27:02.019
Alex: even like a subset of all the features that were in there. And just because, like there were so many.

210
00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:04.000
Alex: and

211
00:27:04.270 --> 00:27:07.320
Alex: we weren't like really using walkie like we were using like a

212
00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:11.240
Alex: minimal viable like Walkie, just because, like everything here.

213
00:27:11.270 --> 00:27:14.240
Alex: also cumbersome to implement from scratch.

214
00:27:14.650 --> 00:27:15.320
Okay?

215
00:27:20.310 --> 00:27:24.710
Lance Byrd: And I I tried to bring that point up

216
00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:26.020
Lance Byrd: with Sam.

217
00:27:26.370 --> 00:27:29.660
Lance Byrd: and I don't think I did a good job with it.

218
00:27:30.470 --> 00:27:40.569
Lance Byrd: That is there some kind of simpler form, I mean, I guess that was our question. Our spreadsheet. Is there some simpler form of wacky like

219
00:27:40.850 --> 00:27:47.049
Lance Byrd: I don't I wasn't there when they were defining Wacky, right? So I don't know the discussions that they had in terms of.

220
00:27:47.230 --> 00:28:01.219
Lance Byrd: Okay, we're going to define this back. And yes, it's going to have lots of steps to it and be complicated. But this is kind of this full implementation that covers as much as we can imagine. that is needed.

221
00:28:02.250 --> 00:28:12.069
Lance Byrd: But yeah, is there this shortcut that can be developed? That's more like a you know. You want to get started in this.

222
00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:16.670
Lance Byrd: This did come world, and you want to. You want to patch credentials.

223
00:28:16.750 --> 00:28:20.100
Lance Byrd: You don't need all of of Wacky

224
00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:22.160
Lance Byrd: and

225
00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:29.800
Lance Byrd: yeah, I can't even say what his answer was. you know, I mean, it sounds like

226
00:28:31.580 --> 00:28:38.280
Lance Byrd: Yeah, yeah, I I like, I said. I don't think I asked the question well enough to to get a a straight answer for that.

227
00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:47.099
Lance Byrd: I don't know any yeah thoughts on what Alex is saying in terms of the complexity of Wacky.

228
00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:57.100
Hakan: I I when I say, okay, please go ahead. No. When when when someone say

229
00:28:57.300 --> 00:29:00.100
Rodolfo Miranda: I'm supporting what

230
00:29:00.590 --> 00:29:03.720
Rodolfo Miranda: do you need to support all the spec, or just

231
00:29:03.870 --> 00:29:08.289
Rodolfo Miranda: because if you're supporting, maybe ending why you you should care about the

232
00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:16.159
Rodolfo Miranda: the the bbs plus. It's how you define that in when you say I am supporting work. I I don't know that

233
00:29:16.700 --> 00:29:18.310
Rodolfo Miranda: how it works or should work.

234
00:29:20.410 --> 00:29:26.730
Alex: Yeah, I think Walk you just like specified the messages like within the walking messages like you. They find the credential types

235
00:29:26.750 --> 00:29:29.970
Alex: and everything like within the messages.

236
00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:33.569
Alex: So as long as I can support, like exchanging those messages

237
00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:43.799
Alex: right, you support the what you spec like in my mind. But then, like, do you implement like, do you have like an Ld processor like for for a single credentials like, do you have?

238
00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:46.490
Alex: That's like the back end question, though.

239
00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:47.749
Oh, yeah.

240
00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:52.800
Rodolfo Miranda: okay. But but you support this proposed of a request issue

241
00:29:53.010 --> 00:30:00.679
Rodolfo Miranda: flow. Are Are you okay? Because that that's maybe Cynthia. Right? I think that the the complex part is the when when you read it

242
00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:03.209
Rodolfo Miranda: the credential representation all day.

243
00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:04.370
Rodolfo Miranda: all the stuff.

244
00:30:04.860 --> 00:30:05.440
Alex: Oh.

245
00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:14.600
Alex: yeah, the thing is like, if you like. Do you have like? Do you have to support like the requesting of credential, like in the like, in the issuing of credential

246
00:30:14.950 --> 00:30:18.549
Alex: all of that kind of stuff. So yeah.

247
00:30:20.450 --> 00:30:21.710
Lance Byrd: and then

248
00:30:22.380 --> 00:30:25.990
Lance Byrd: in some ways does this dovetail with the discovery?

249
00:30:26.070 --> 00:30:28.760
Lance Byrd: A protocol? Because

250
00:30:29.100 --> 00:30:43.059
Lance Byrd: I mean the at least that's the way that at a high level they talk about did come V. 2 is like oh, you know Well, at the very least, you know you have this messaging layer that you can at least approach another agent and say.

251
00:30:43.460 --> 00:30:55.810
Lance Byrd: you know high right like you try to get started with each other, and then you can discover what that that agent or mediator supports in order to figure out, You know at what level you can

252
00:30:56.140 --> 00:30:58.099
Lance Byrd: do business right

253
00:30:58.560 --> 00:31:00.520
Lance Byrd: so. But like

254
00:31:00.940 --> 00:31:09.610
Lance Byrd: do you, is, is is the this features of Wacky? Would that fit within that discovery protocol?

255
00:31:10.580 --> 00:31:11.609
Lance Byrd: Or is that

256
00:31:11.730 --> 00:31:20.819
Lance Byrd: a different little lay level or layer, because you know, a lot of times we've talked about the discovery protocol just in terms of like, what application protocols do you support?

257
00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:26.089
Lance Byrd: But like. Can you dive deep enough to say I do, Wacky. But I don't do bbs plus

258
00:31:29.020 --> 00:31:32.650
Lance Byrd: same by now. Yeah.

259
00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:39.779
Rodolfo Miranda: yeah, it's not to testify. So you you. You can do whatever you want, but both parties should know what they are telling.

260
00:31:39.860 --> 00:31:42.339
Rodolfo Miranda: It's not the the protocol is

261
00:31:42.490 --> 00:31:47.010
Rodolfo Miranda: flexible enough to to do whatever you want to also extend that to

262
00:31:47.140 --> 00:31:48.080
Rodolfo Miranda: 2 other

263
00:31:48.330 --> 00:31:49.370
Rodolfo Miranda: thanks. But.

264
00:31:50.070 --> 00:31:53.630
Rodolfo Miranda: I think we we need this, this

265
00:31:55.460 --> 00:31:59.869
Rodolfo Miranda: Rfc. To be included, and really tell what what it means for that.

266
00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:08.679
Lance Byrd: because I I guess my sense is, you know.

267
00:32:08.980 --> 00:32:12.059
Lance Byrd: I think we're saying like really important things here.

268
00:32:13.910 --> 00:32:18.889
Lance Byrd: My sense is that this scope is, is is widening or is wide enough.

269
00:32:19.320 --> 00:32:24.020
Lance Byrd: And even at the just the wacky level, that

270
00:32:24.590 --> 00:32:30.349
Lance Byrd: yeah, there needs to be this negotiation that basically says, like.

271
00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:42.699
Lance Byrd: there's a lot that we could all be supporting. This is what I support, and and at least being able to transfer that amount of information so that 2 agents could know

272
00:32:44.610 --> 00:32:46.089
Lance Byrd: what they can do.

273
00:32:47.130 --> 00:32:57.930
Hakan: Yeah, but I I I think that's the part of the profiles that are defined also in the discount spec right? We do have these 3 profiles right now that it can be one or 4 in total

274
00:32:58.210 --> 00:33:05.909
Hakan: did a IP, one a IP 2 with encryption envelope, old IP 2 with the encryption develop new, and this Con V. 2. Basically

275
00:33:06.510 --> 00:33:08.090
Hakan: So I guess

276
00:33:08.170 --> 00:33:16.990
Hakan: there would be a chance to actually increase the amount of profiles that that are supported like I don't see why that would be a problem

277
00:33:17.450 --> 00:33:19.589
Hakan: like, for example. Yeah.

278
00:33:19.780 --> 00:33:24.989
Lance Byrd: yes, sorry. I I guess i'm worried that we are discovering that

279
00:33:25.700 --> 00:33:27.260
Lance Byrd: having a

280
00:33:27.900 --> 00:33:29.799
Lance Byrd: profile that's like.

281
00:33:30.270 --> 00:33:37.930
Lance Byrd: Okay, this is the set of things that I support, and i'm going to give it a label, right? I. It's sounding to me like

282
00:33:37.990 --> 00:33:44.470
Lance Byrd: that may not scale like the that. That's not possible anymore that there's so many different

283
00:33:44.860 --> 00:33:46.200
Lance Byrd: elements

284
00:33:46.330 --> 00:33:48.710
Lance Byrd: that it's more like.

285
00:33:48.870 --> 00:33:59.629
Lance Byrd: How do I present to you everything that I can do? And you can present to me everything you can do, and then we can decide how we are going to interrupt

286
00:34:00.130 --> 00:34:06.299
Lance Byrd: right like, you know, if you only speak India and I in the credentials, let's say, and I don't do that.

287
00:34:06.500 --> 00:34:23.420
Lance Byrd: then we know we can't get started. But maybe we find out. You know I support Indie and Bbs and you for Jason Ld. And Bbs. And now we can. We can. We can go ahead and and negotiate to use Pbs. Or something like that, like,

288
00:34:23.429 --> 00:34:28.940
Lance Byrd: if i'm talking crazy, you know, but that i'm starting to get this sense that it's

289
00:34:29.350 --> 00:34:34.689
Lance Byrd: that that yeah, just this labeling of a of an aip might be difficult.

290
00:34:35.889 --> 00:34:42.589
Lance Byrd: so then, that that the new aip should be something more of like, how do we discover

291
00:34:42.750 --> 00:34:44.860
Lance Byrd: how to interrupt with each other?

292
00:34:45.730 --> 00:34:53.729
Hakan: But yeah, I might be getting to Meta just just thoughts. Yeah, I I I think it's it's very, very like, quite quite meta.

293
00:34:54.600 --> 00:34:55.620
Lance Byrd: Yeah.

294
00:34:55.980 --> 00:35:05.429
Lance Byrd: and which which I kind of hate, by the way, but you know I I the bottom line is, I don't see a clear path yet, because you guys are bringing up such good

295
00:35:05.660 --> 00:35:11.899
Lance Byrd: nuanced questions. I mean, I think, that Jf. Activity was so important to

296
00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:14.400
Lance Byrd: kind of expose

297
00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:20.889
Lance Byrd: the variety that that can occur. And so they chose this shortest path right? And

298
00:35:22.860 --> 00:35:32.409
Alex: I guess, in my opinion I see kind of like what you're saying is like you're trying to figure out what signatures you support right. Like, hey? Do we support the signal signature types

299
00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:35.759
Alex: the same like low level cryptography.

300
00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:43.349
Alex: But in my experience the low-level cryptography, like depends on a like use case basis, like at the application level it

301
00:35:43.430 --> 00:35:44.770
Alex: and the

302
00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:47.310
Alex: I don't think you can exchange

303
00:35:47.440 --> 00:35:48.810
Alex: cryptography

304
00:35:49.030 --> 00:35:53.299
Alex: at maybe like at an agent basis.

305
00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:57.150
Alex: Maybe you can, because the agent

306
00:35:57.710 --> 00:36:05.399
Alex: well, but the question is like, now, does the agent have to support, like all the lower level cryptography, or like, can that be delegated to other parties right?

307
00:36:05.620 --> 00:36:08.109
Alex: Because I guess what i'm trying to say is that

308
00:36:08.170 --> 00:36:13.279
Alex: some some issue or like in the issue credential flow. They might support Jwt.

309
00:36:13.390 --> 00:36:15.949
Alex: but they might not so

310
00:36:16.170 --> 00:36:19.080
Alex: like to find that they find that

311
00:36:19.150 --> 00:36:24.959
Alex: a format exchange, like whatever like signatures you support like within the messages within walking.

312
00:36:25.120 --> 00:36:26.380
Alex: So I think it's.

313
00:36:27.940 --> 00:36:31.629
Alex: i'm not sure that we can exchange keys at the

314
00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:36.629
Alex: it at the agent level like key format, because

315
00:36:37.510 --> 00:36:41.920
Alex: you would exchange it like a application like use case level

316
00:36:42.250 --> 00:36:42.959
Alex: like

317
00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:47.630
Alex: another agent doesn't care what your agent does with key management.

318
00:36:47.720 --> 00:36:53.130
Alex: That's the way I think about it, like whatever like your agent does with key management. What is it? Support? It's like an internal thing.

319
00:36:53.250 --> 00:36:54.379
Alex: and then

320
00:36:54.790 --> 00:37:02.110
Alex: you want to expose that at the application level. Hey? For this use case this credential was signed with this P.

321
00:37:02.700 --> 00:37:04.709
Alex: Does that make sense?

322
00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:07.240
Alex: I'm not sure I can. I'm wording it properly

323
00:37:10.900 --> 00:37:16.790
Lance Byrd: to some degree it it makes sense to me, having not implemented at the level that you have.

324
00:37:17.180 --> 00:37:20.700
Lance Byrd: I I just basically take your word for it.

325
00:37:22.190 --> 00:37:26.130
Lance Byrd: but so so well, I guess. What?

326
00:37:26.790 --> 00:37:36.270
Lance Byrd: Yeah, it's still going back to based on what you're saying. I'm still going back to this concept of a discovery protocol. And if that's discovering application.

327
00:37:36.900 --> 00:37:43.390
Lance Byrd: level protocols that you support, are you saying that there could be richer information.

328
00:37:43.880 --> 00:37:46.100
Lance Byrd: more detail about

329
00:37:46.260 --> 00:37:51.979
Lance Byrd: that application, protocol, and some of the nuance of things that you would have to support within it.

330
00:37:53.150 --> 00:38:02.680
Alex: Right? Exactly like do you have to like some sub protocol like support like within, like walk is like, hey? I don't do like the like. The request proof

331
00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:10.370
Alex: like I don't I don't request for credential to issue your credential for some whatever reason, right

332
00:38:10.590 --> 00:38:15.579
Alex: or hey in this group chat like, I don't support having like an admin in my group Chat protocol.

333
00:38:16.620 --> 00:38:23.190
Alex: But yeah, then, like it becomes like, how do you define protocols? So yeah, it's

334
00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:35.640
Rodolfo Miranda: maybe one way to to define this and how to work with this to cover, discover features. Protocol, because I think it's it's generic and body for for this aip

335
00:38:36.050 --> 00:38:42.930
Rodolfo Miranda: a 3 we can define. Okay in discovery. You need to support at least this support with roles. You you

336
00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:54.589
Rodolfo Miranda: you can handle with protocols some specific protocols on the way. You should, specifically, if they are nuances within each protocol like they walk you as I. I support

337
00:38:54.640 --> 00:39:04.919
Rodolfo Miranda: what key or issue credential 3 in this formula, something like that, and and we specify, how should we state on the on the discovery protocol.

338
00:39:09.290 --> 00:39:11.179
Rodolfo Miranda: That can be one way.

339
00:39:11.470 --> 00:39:12.390
Lance Byrd: Yeah.

340
00:39:13.710 --> 00:39:18.980
Alex: I guess something that I saw in the Acupy meeting. They had like handshake protocols in the message

341
00:39:19.260 --> 00:39:21.200
Alex: for like showing

342
00:39:21.780 --> 00:39:25.259
Alex: what's it called working with

343
00:39:26.060 --> 00:39:27.200
Alex: the

344
00:39:27.450 --> 00:39:34.010
Alex: Okay. Now, do you open?

345
00:39:34.170 --> 00:39:38.429
Alex: Yeah, like, I said that they have some like handshake protocols like in there.

346
00:39:38.670 --> 00:39:41.609
Alex: I wasn't sure what was their thought behind that

347
00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:46.810
Alex: he has something similar.

348
00:39:47.300 --> 00:39:50.069
Alex: I don't want to have like a new field.

349
00:39:53.330 --> 00:39:57.539
Rodolfo Miranda: so so on the on the table. How can you you add them?

350
00:39:57.750 --> 00:40:03.440
Rodolfo Miranda: Okay. This is the V 2 protocol. I see that this is exchange. Do we need that

351
00:40:03.540 --> 00:40:04.650
Rodolfo Miranda: in this one

352
00:40:05.210 --> 00:40:06.609
Hakan: to the Exchange.

353
00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:07.919
Rodolfo Miranda: Yeah.

354
00:40:08.070 --> 00:40:09.249
Hakan: I think so.

355
00:40:09.410 --> 00:40:25.669
Hakan: I think so. I I I think so because I think it's it. It came from a IP. 2 point all for did come v. 2 conformity. So we we're exchanging. We're moving from connections protocol to the Exchange protocol.

356
00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:34.650
Hakan: And if it's a public did, it can be resolved via the Did exchange. And if we are going for a

357
00:40:36.380 --> 00:40:43.950
Hakan: going for a period, for example. in that case it can be done with using an out of band protocol.

358
00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:47.149
Hakan: which which also is a part of

359
00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:49.779
Hakan: well. It's seen as a part of the exchange

360
00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:58.469
Hakan: for my understanding did exchange is how Aries deals with

361
00:40:58.710 --> 00:41:03.220
Hakan: I think threats from from Didcom V. 2 specification.

362
00:41:08.100 --> 00:41:12.380
Rodolfo Miranda: Okay, I need to check that. Yeah, that's part of it. Is

363
00:41:12.580 --> 00:41:13.879
Rodolfo Miranda: this change?

364
00:41:14.330 --> 00:41:15.000
Hakan: Yeah.

365
00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:21.220
Hakan: So those are a bit old, comments.

366
00:41:23.410 --> 00:41:35.670
Hakan: I I will. I will need to go through this document again to

367
00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:40.420
Rodolfo Miranda: so based to to solve the did it key us as well. Yeah.

368
00:41:40.450 --> 00:41:41.270
Rodolfo Miranda: yeah.

369
00:41:43.940 --> 00:41:50.519
Rodolfo Miranda: you're gonna to use to it. Key. You need did this change. But you, if you use, did it, you basically

370
00:41:50.570 --> 00:41:53.529
Rodolfo Miranda: don't need it just as we play back today

371
00:41:54.020 --> 00:41:57.120
Rodolfo Miranda: to the URL that is in the the

372
00:42:02.090 --> 00:42:04.069
Hakan: i'm not sure if I understood you. Sorry.

373
00:42:04.430 --> 00:42:06.159
Rodolfo Miranda: because

374
00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:08.910
Rodolfo Miranda: I think if you, if you

375
00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:15.699
Rodolfo Miranda: you, you you can create a an out of one and just the the other party. Can

376
00:42:15.900 --> 00:42:27.929
Rodolfo Miranda: we solve the Didn't. P. And that's inside the out of one, and we play back to you because in the Ddp. Are you gonna have this service endpoint, and you're gonna have the URL how to communicate back. So you you don't need the protocol to

377
00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:31.379
Rodolfo Miranda: understand it. They They they did it

378
00:42:31.840 --> 00:42:34.029
Rodolfo Miranda: the did from the 2 parties right.

379
00:42:34.720 --> 00:42:37.460
Rodolfo Miranda: the one who received the out of

380
00:42:37.490 --> 00:42:47.149
Rodolfo Miranda: which which is that did it Pr. From the Creator of the outcome. But and when you replay back you actually you send your did so. I can create the connection

381
00:42:47.180 --> 00:42:54.259
Hakan: exactly. But you still need to the exchange, because all of this stuff is based on protocols like

382
00:42:54.720 --> 00:43:14.370
Hakan: basically defining how an agent should behave when something comes to them. And I I think that's why whether it is like a peer-dit or a key, did key or a public. Did you still need to did the exchange protocol to go through? first of all, what's it again?

383
00:43:14.750 --> 00:43:33.169
Hakan: the first one is exchange requests that can be with the out of bend, if it's, for example, should be broadcasted. The second thing is exchange response how the counterparty is responding to it. And then there is the exchange complete as the last step.

384
00:43:33.180 --> 00:43:36.320
Hakan: and all agents needs to go through this to

385
00:43:36.360 --> 00:43:37.379
Hakan: gets

386
00:43:37.460 --> 00:43:41.909
Hakan: create like internally in Aries clients, a

387
00:43:42.130 --> 00:43:48.919
Hakan: connection, Id and the connection situation that I've established or completed.

388
00:43:51.160 --> 00:44:06.179
Rodolfo Miranda: Okay, okay. Well, yeah, that's that's because yeah, they in the eighties, probably they on the framework. They implement that way. So it's it's fine. But maybe we we need to to refine a little bit based on what did it come be to?

389
00:44:06.610 --> 00:44:09.159
Rodolfo Miranda: Can provide if you are using like.

390
00:44:11.890 --> 00:44:16.609
Hakan: yeah, as you, you are not using a Aries, are you or

391
00:44:16.710 --> 00:44:22.040
Rodolfo Miranda: I? No, we we build like a framework without a

392
00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:29.769
Rodolfo Miranda: without a without a and we tested against Agapi. So we we are playing with both right.

393
00:44:30.110 --> 00:44:32.519
Rodolfo Miranda: so on and that way

394
00:44:32.580 --> 00:44:36.349
Rodolfo Miranda: when we because we started, we didn't come with you, Plan didn't come with you.

395
00:44:36.810 --> 00:44:47.390
Rodolfo Miranda: In that case we didn't need the the Exchange protocol because it's just one message. So it's easy in a way. Doing a visit,

396
00:44:47.570 --> 00:44:50.280
Rodolfo Miranda: I did it exchange at this. Just

397
00:44:50.360 --> 00:44:54.029
Rodolfo Miranda: so play we didn't come with you that we we don't need the protocol right.

398
00:44:55.640 --> 00:45:02.930
Rodolfo Miranda: But if you but but we are right, because If you are using a you need this concept of of connection and some how to

399
00:45:03.420 --> 00:45:07.530
Rodolfo Miranda: write it on and establish that connection when you receive the messages. So

400
00:45:07.890 --> 00:45:09.640
Rodolfo Miranda: yeah, it's fine. So

401
00:45:10.530 --> 00:45:11.250
Alex: so

402
00:45:11.530 --> 00:45:27.650
Alex: I guess. How do we want to handle the concept of connections? And that can be to right? Because then I feel like this is like one of the big biggest, like breaking changes between V. One and V 2 is this concept of like? There's no connection, concept, and like this like whole key agreement heck up and is happening like on each message

403
00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:29.109
Alex: right now.

404
00:45:29.370 --> 00:45:30.160
Alex: Oh.

405
00:45:30.470 --> 00:45:35.669
Alex: and in my opinion, I think in the Company 3 is going to change again.

406
00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:41.679
Alex: because you can scale encryption on each message if you want to do like group things with lots of people.

407
00:45:42.080 --> 00:45:43.649
Alex: so

408
00:45:44.590 --> 00:45:48.819
Alex: yeah, like we want to tackle it, or maybe just

409
00:45:48.880 --> 00:45:51.790
Alex: keep having this concept of connections and try to

410
00:45:51.920 --> 00:45:54.619
Alex: have they come to to use the connections concept

411
00:45:54.740 --> 00:45:55.750
Alex: somehow.

412
00:45:56.030 --> 00:46:01.250
Alex: like using their like rotation processes, and maybe we can make a protocol that way.

413
00:46:02.700 --> 00:46:03.439
Hakan: So

414
00:46:04.690 --> 00:46:14.730
Hakan: from what I understood, at least the time that I was some s current and steering Koran was in the call is that we want to keep connection. Id as a

415
00:46:15.570 --> 00:46:22.219
Hakan: is that abstract const as a construct to keep these information related to a connection.

416
00:46:25.030 --> 00:46:26.199
Hakan: yeah, I I don't think

417
00:46:27.050 --> 00:46:30.640
Hakan: so far the plan wasn't to make it disappear. Basically

418
00:46:31.550 --> 00:46:32.890
Hakan: But to work with it.

419
00:46:35.740 --> 00:46:44.910
Alex: Yeah, like, I think, like a person like makes sense like it makes like development a lot easier to have this like abstraction. There is of like a connection concept to like, keep track of like messages, and like

420
00:46:45.100 --> 00:46:51.920
Alex: like having like a thread and whatnot. So yeah, like i'm all for it like like I myself. Haven't like figured out a way to

421
00:46:51.990 --> 00:46:58.179
Alex: resolved messages like if it changes and like good rotation like I haven't had to deal with all that. So

422
00:46:58.480 --> 00:46:59.189
Yeah.

423
00:46:59.220 --> 00:47:00.009
Hakan: yeah.

424
00:47:00.920 --> 00:47:09.770
Hakan: But speaking of this multi messaging, I think this is one of the parts that you are interested in. If I understand you correctly, because you mentioned a couple of times.

425
00:47:09.870 --> 00:47:22.039
Hakan: we might need to extend the basic message protocol, and like, or or or create something like a multi messaging concept, or as a feature as an Rfc.

426
00:47:22.090 --> 00:47:24.559
Hakan: if you want to. have it

427
00:47:25.280 --> 00:47:27.850
Hakan: in the Didcom V: 2 profile, basically.

428
00:47:28.850 --> 00:47:29.680
Yeah.

429
00:47:29.740 --> 00:47:40.889
Alex: I mean, like, I'm: not. Yeah, like I'm personally interested in having like creating like a group chat out of this coming to like. I think that's just like the like, the like an easy thing.

430
00:47:41.060 --> 00:47:57.479
Alex: like a low, level lift in terms of like application that can be developed. Because right now I feel like a lot of interactions like one to one, so I i'm interested to like the one to many interaction, just to see what complexity brings mainly in group like a group. Chat is the easiest implementation of that.

431
00:47:58.190 --> 00:47:58.750
Yeah.

432
00:47:59.950 --> 00:48:05.630
Alex: But I see the time as just being like a peer-to-peer protocol like in it of its nature, which is

433
00:48:06.280 --> 00:48:09.690
Alex: yeah, like it's not pure one, too many. Right?

434
00:48:10.450 --> 00:48:11.100
Yeah.

435
00:48:11.160 --> 00:48:17.369
Hakan: but can be extended as you said. So. Yeah, yeah, yeah, definitely, definitely. Like, i'm interested in like trying to do that work as well. Yeah.

436
00:48:24.570 --> 00:48:25.299
see

437
00:48:25.810 --> 00:48:34.619
Lance Byrd: trying to fill in our meeting page real quick. I created it and posted a link for anybody wants to put themselves on, although I think we already have

438
00:48:36.170 --> 00:48:42.299
Lance Byrd: he in Rudolfo Alex. So I think we have everybody who is on confluence

439
00:48:42.550 --> 00:48:43.819
Lance Byrd: on there.

440
00:48:47.040 --> 00:48:49.799
Lance Byrd: and I'm just adding some of our notes

441
00:48:59.110 --> 00:49:04.329
Hakan: you that you don't have hyper ledger access, right? So the Hyper Ledger Foundation.

442
00:49:04.690 --> 00:49:05.969
Judith HÃ¶gerl: And not only

443
00:49:08.310 --> 00:49:09.430
Hakan: okay.

444
00:49:19.630 --> 00:49:22.850
Lance Byrd: okay, so

445
00:49:23.650 --> 00:49:31.439
Lance Byrd: do we just wanna maybe we let's do quick update on on just People's did Com. V: 2 activities as well.

446
00:49:31.630 --> 00:49:33.590
Lance Byrd: It's always nice to keep up with each other.

447
00:49:33.680 --> 00:49:39.890
Lance Byrd: and we haven't heard yeah, from each person just what they're up to. So

448
00:49:40.210 --> 00:49:42.859
Lance Byrd: yeah for me.

449
00:49:42.930 --> 00:49:47.000
Lance Byrd: what am I up to other than yeah, this stuff specifically.

450
00:49:47.090 --> 00:49:51.100
Lance Byrd: Yeah, I don't have any active. Did come V: 2 activities going.

451
00:49:51.890 --> 00:49:53.910
Lance Byrd: How about you anybody?

452
00:50:01.020 --> 00:50:06.689
Rodolfo Miranda: I think this one is the the main one.

453
00:50:08.870 --> 00:50:14.760
Judith HÃ¶gerl: So, in fact, there is an open, full request for issue credential in prison proof

454
00:50:14.810 --> 00:50:23.189
Judith HÃ¶gerl: protocols for did come version 2. And now there's like the question how to handle connections, and then you get to get the information from connections.

455
00:50:23.340 --> 00:50:38.540
Judith HÃ¶gerl: and which message form it is used. And then to that the like the encryption, but also then maybe to re. When you have the information about which did conversion is used, you can actually reuse some of that come out of the like

456
00:50:38.970 --> 00:50:41.569
Judith HÃ¶gerl: aip, one and 2 also.

457
00:50:41.640 --> 00:50:45.639
Judith HÃ¶gerl: But yeah, the connection is the big issue. Also to continue.

458
00:50:46.270 --> 00:51:03.589
Lance Byrd: How's the level of support for that activity. for you, Judith, is is it basically that that that Hawkin? And then, whatever meetings you guys attend in terms of like occupy, or whatever is that is that where you're getting the most support, or or is there.

459
00:51:04.010 --> 00:51:11.349
Lance Byrd: or like the currents supporting you or anybody else, or Daniel Hardman, or I guess the

460
00:51:11.380 --> 00:51:12.630
Lance Byrd: the diff

461
00:51:12.770 --> 00:51:14.009
Lance Byrd: user group.

462
00:51:14.810 --> 00:51:22.689
Lance Byrd: I'm. Just interested in terms of, you know. Like, are are we? It is there more?

463
00:51:23.540 --> 00:51:30.559
Judith HÃ¶gerl: I mean, I got a feedback today to for the call request, but also like, yeah. Then there's this meeting

464
00:51:30.600 --> 00:51:37.260
Judith HÃ¶gerl: you to meeting, and yeah, like, there's the other meeting for Akup, which I cannot attend on Tuesday, because

465
00:51:37.420 --> 00:51:43.240
Judith HÃ¶gerl: i'm not free on those days. But yeah, so how can it tends that? And then. Yeah, and they have many things for talking.

466
00:51:43.410 --> 00:51:56.269
Hakan: So in in terms of support, I think we have a lot of I mean ideas, and like, for example, there was some. I made also a couple of comments on Judith's pull request.

467
00:51:56.280 --> 00:52:09.359
Hakan: Oh, good! So we are. We are getting feedback, but like in terms of muscle. It's very limited, and it's basically due to so far for the Ziptone V: 2 in areas implemented a a of a comp implementation.

468
00:52:09.520 --> 00:52:10.910
Lance Byrd: Yeah. Fair.

469
00:52:11.630 --> 00:52:12.240
Hakan: Yeah.

470
00:52:13.140 --> 00:52:15.180
Lance Byrd: Okay.

471
00:52:17.690 --> 00:52:24.609
Lance Byrd: So so in terms of like talking about connections, what is

472
00:52:26.380 --> 00:52:30.539
Lance Byrd: what are some ideas for? How we can accelerate that conversation?

473
00:52:34.060 --> 00:52:44.399
Judith HÃ¶gerl: Well, in my opinion, like one important step would be maybe to make out of band working for the message structure did company to as well.

474
00:52:44.780 --> 00:52:55.820
Judith HÃ¶gerl: and then there would be a way to establish like. How can I already said like there would be a way to establish a did come v 2 connection by having an out of that protocol working for it to come. V to message structure.

475
00:52:56.100 --> 00:53:03.640
Judith HÃ¶gerl: And then yeah. From there you would have the information. Okay, we're using to commit to. And then you can basically use the protocols from.

476
00:53:03.940 --> 00:53:05.900
Judith HÃ¶gerl: and that company, too, as well.

477
00:53:06.810 --> 00:53:09.310
Judith HÃ¶gerl: That would be one approach, For example.

478
00:53:09.810 --> 00:53:10.629
Judith HÃ¶gerl: I don't know.

479
00:53:13.810 --> 00:53:26.130
Hakan: Yeah. And due to the limited site that we have, because it's like a massive uses as well like, we will need to come up with some results like by end of February middle of March, or something like that. So

480
00:53:26.210 --> 00:53:27.700
Hakan: that's why

481
00:53:28.100 --> 00:53:32.989
Hakan: I personally would like to go for a more pragmatic approach of

482
00:53:33.160 --> 00:53:39.909
Hakan: defining a profile, saying that this is what it supports it. And yeah, tackle how we can

483
00:53:39.940 --> 00:53:44.850
Hakan: just make it happen basically if it's going to be to encryption of a low-place message structure for

484
00:53:44.980 --> 00:53:48.379
Hakan: basic messaging, issuing credentials and presenting proofs.

485
00:53:48.790 --> 00:53:52.460
Hakan: and of course, establishment of Aries connections.

486
00:53:55.190 --> 00:53:56.060
Lance Byrd: Okay.

487
00:53:58.830 --> 00:54:01.080
Lance Byrd: Yes, I guess. Well, you know

488
00:54:01.150 --> 00:54:05.980
Lance Byrd: one thing that well, whenever we get to kind of this

489
00:54:06.630 --> 00:54:24.359
Lance Byrd: place, where you know we have some meta discussions, and then, you know we also have these actual implementations going on. I think that's really good. and it helps to constrain us. we do have a a customer, you know, not only a roots Id itself doing to come be, too, but we have

490
00:54:24.450 --> 00:54:29.140
Lance Byrd: customers who are interested in customers who are actually implementing

491
00:54:29.190 --> 00:54:33.180
Lance Byrd: d comedy to as well. So

492
00:54:33.750 --> 00:54:36.109
Lance Byrd: hopefully, we can use

493
00:54:36.340 --> 00:54:41.179
Lance Byrd: the intersection of of these implementations to

494
00:54:41.760 --> 00:54:45.099
Lance Byrd: to to, you know, come to

495
00:54:45.840 --> 00:54:54.939
Lance Byrd: come to terms with, you know, being grounded not being so, Meta. you know that's partly why I I kind of started building the spreadsheet.

496
00:54:55.080 --> 00:54:58.300
Lance Byrd: I wish that I was more.

497
00:54:58.890 --> 00:55:05.499
Lance Byrd: You know, a lot of times when I do these kinds of things like I have a very clear vision that I really want to drive on, and in this case,

498
00:55:05.560 --> 00:55:09.749
Lance Byrd: there's just more information to together.

499
00:55:10.340 --> 00:55:22.600
Lance Byrd: So what am I trying to say? I'm trying to say that I want to capture the actual details of these implementations in the spreadsheet, so that we can properly discuss

500
00:55:22.680 --> 00:55:24.589
Lance Byrd: individual pieces

501
00:55:25.170 --> 00:55:32.969
Lance Byrd: and and so i'm. I'm. Open to ideas and energy and and thoughts. You know. I want to to help

502
00:55:32.990 --> 00:55:45.759
Lance Byrd: capture these things, but it's hard right, because i'm not doing the implementation. Other people are doing the implementation, and there's multiple of them on going. So I just want everyone to know that i'm trying to grapple with like, how do we

503
00:55:45.770 --> 00:55:53.060
Lance Byrd: use this, this so valuable information of of these implementations going on, and and I think it's

504
00:55:53.890 --> 00:55:56.230
Lance Byrd: honestly the occupy work

505
00:55:56.560 --> 00:56:07.370
Lance Byrd: is unique. at least from my point of view, because, like like Rhoda said, you know, we just started with did come V. 2. So we we kind of don't have that.

506
00:56:08.200 --> 00:56:09.929
Lance Byrd: They come. V. One

507
00:56:10.530 --> 00:56:18.990
Lance Byrd: constraint. Yeah, the the back issue, or the legacy of it as much weighing on us and our customer doesn't, either.

508
00:56:19.180 --> 00:56:21.890
Lance Byrd: and but

509
00:56:22.210 --> 00:56:31.370
Lance Byrd: that's why they occupy stuff so valuable. Because there are going there, you know, these important implementations are, do do have this legacy. So yeah.

510
00:56:32.580 --> 00:56:35.299
Lance Byrd: I said, a lot of words.

511
00:56:35.940 --> 00:56:48.700
Alex: Yeah, I think, like even like bringing the guys that are like outside the hyper ledger ecosystem, they might have like a different total view on how to handle this, and like how we can like interrupt with them as well and like. They might have like an interesting

512
00:56:48.950 --> 00:56:55.280
Alex: to to say like how we can leverage different like profiles, and from that perspective. So

513
00:56:57.460 --> 00:56:58.799
Lance Byrd: so

514
00:56:59.010 --> 00:57:02.970
Lance Byrd: maybe I, I will take that as a a

515
00:57:05.690 --> 00:57:15.159
Lance Byrd: a task, or or if if Alex, You feel like you want to reach out to them and try to figure out how we can get them, either in this meeting or

516
00:57:17.320 --> 00:57:19.770
Lance Byrd: at least capture their work.

517
00:57:20.290 --> 00:57:32.720
Alex: Yeah, I think like, yeah, maybe Nick can get here because he's like on the East Coast. It's like he's in New York. So yeah, i'll let him know about this, although he has been attending the deaf once

518
00:57:32.800 --> 00:57:43.730
Lance Byrd: an and and by the way, this meeting having this before the diff meeting, I think, is helping in terms of right capturing that audience as well. So

519
00:57:45.550 --> 00:57:49.310
Alex: yeah, maybe we can bring it up. That

520
00:57:52.650 --> 00:58:10.849
Hakan: okay, we have 2Â min left. So a little up from my side. I will, or we will talk of in the next a cup I implementation group a kapak, about which encryption envelope to go for or like.

521
00:58:11.760 --> 00:58:13.340
Hakan: see whether.

522
00:58:13.690 --> 00:58:19.519
Hakan: and because there's so many different ones, including like a native implementation of it on a

523
00:58:20.030 --> 00:58:32.849
Hakan: So question comes to which one do we want to use? And I think that would be also play a role in. Yeah, what Alex was mentioning about like how to deal with key exchange. And all those things are on that encryption envelope level basically

524
00:58:33.090 --> 00:58:35.760
Hakan: of this call implementation. So

525
00:58:36.270 --> 00:58:39.019
Hakan: yeah, I will update you next time.

526
00:58:39.180 --> 00:58:44.110
Hakan: but I I think we'll see each other next Monday, anyway, before that call it's called happens on Tuesdays.

527
00:58:45.610 --> 00:58:46.760
Lance Byrd: Yeah, a fair.

528
00:58:48.170 --> 00:58:49.939
Lance Byrd: Any other thoughts.

529
00:58:50.060 --> 00:58:50.870
and then

530
00:58:53.070 --> 00:58:56.089
Lance Byrd: I I think I I do, I I I

531
00:58:56.190 --> 00:58:58.709
Lance Byrd: This is the first time that i'm thinking

532
00:58:59.490 --> 00:59:10.789
Lance Byrd: towards like a more detailed form of discovery. It just seems to me to be so valuable if there really is a way to for agents to tell each other.

533
00:59:10.830 --> 00:59:20.030
Lance Byrd: these are all the things that I support you know, with much more detail than maybe what we've kind of thought of in the discovery

534
00:59:20.070 --> 00:59:28.300
Lance Byrd: protocol in the past. So I mean that's for me a big takeaway from this like. Is there a more detailed way for agents to

535
00:59:28.730 --> 00:59:30.469
Lance Byrd: you know? Talk about their

536
00:59:30.640 --> 00:59:34.299
Lance Byrd: encryption, envelope, and things like that. So

537
00:59:35.940 --> 00:59:38.889
Lance Byrd: yeah, Any other thoughts? I think it's really good.

538
00:59:43.820 --> 00:59:48.519
Lance Byrd: Okay, All right. We did it. Sorry that I was late. I i'll do better next time

539
00:59:49.020 --> 01:00:03.530
Lance Byrd: these contractor Cabinet folks are killing me. That's why that was my personal problem. Thank you all. It's always great to see you. I really appreciate this meeting. Yeah, See you all bye, bye, bye, bye.

540
01:00:03.680 --> 01:00:04.890
Alex: Thank you.
