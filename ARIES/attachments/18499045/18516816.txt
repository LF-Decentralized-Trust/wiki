08:16:17	 From  Stephen Curran : https://anoncreds-wg.github.io/anoncreds-spec/
08:16:41	 From  Rodolfo Miranda : I have this link: https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot11-the-hague/blob/master/draft-documents/specification-for-ledger-agnostic-anoncreds.md
08:29:23	 From  Warren Gallagher : Is there value in localized strings for attribute values? For example representing an enumeration in a particular language?
08:34:20	 From  James Ebert : Are the primary & secondary attributes considered optional for display?
08:47:20	 From  Colton Wolkins : Should probably make sure it's versionable within the code as well. That way, a credential may say, "Here's my V1 credential layout info, and here's my V2 layout info"
08:48:07	 From  James Ebert : I would agree on Warrenâ€™s point on differing display formats other than cards.
09:00:48	 From  Warren Gallagher : Excellent
