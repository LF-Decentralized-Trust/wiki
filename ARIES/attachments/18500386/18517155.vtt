1
00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:32.420
Patrik Stas: I'll hold there. It seems like, today it's gonna be again a sort of podcastage format, so i'll just go over

2
00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:38.530
Patrik Stas: the stuff which in which been happening the last week, and what the race

3
00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.330
Patrik Stas: plan for the next one.

4
00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:43.809
Patrik Stas: So let me share my screen

5
00:02:46.010 --> 00:03:01.189
Patrik Stas: all right. so there is no further discussion to do as we currently don't have a participants online. So i'll just go through, and the the gender points

6
00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:14.280
Patrik Stas: so first the for the recent work we have done we have, we had a bunch of releases over the last week to kind of clearly separate some of the important work.

7
00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:22.559
Patrik Stas: so we first release 0 48, which basically covers contains

8
00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:26.459
Patrik Stas: pr which has been already covered at the previous week.

9
00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:33.709
Patrik Stas: mostly. then, after the end, those really is 0 49, but due to

10
00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:51.359
Patrik Stas: Ci issues and like various silly obstructions happening. Those subsequent release 0, 49 one which should be considered sort of the proper full and proper one. so

11
00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:59.170
Patrik Stas: this contain, added, Ios leg legacy. I was rapper

12
00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:04.260
Patrik Stas: release job which is really seeing the

13
00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:14.029
Patrik Stas: ios rapper in the previous form before the refactoring which has been done by pool and merge the previous week.

14
00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:20.789
Patrik Stas: so sort of to enable is on migration for whoever

15
00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:24.369
Patrik Stas: haven't yet updated the

16
00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:26.910
Patrik Stas: synced up with the record changes

17
00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.289
Patrik Stas: next up.

18
00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:36.900
Patrik Stas: That was a small fix regarding reading and

19
00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:42.470
Patrik Stas: from the in the ledger is the routing keys.

20
00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:44.870
Patrik Stas: Field is completely omitted.

21
00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.289
Patrik Stas: on the ledger

22
00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:56.160
Patrik Stas: and lastly and most importantly, I think, oh, 0, 50 nice round number release.

23
00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:02.509
Patrik Stas: which notably contain this huge Pr from George.

24
00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:04.810
Patrik Stas: 6, 0,

25
00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:06.860
Patrik Stas: 6, 4, 8

26
00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:17.699
Patrik Stas: we just modularizing the S architecture and enable opting into either using Vdr tools as a sort of

27
00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:33.210
Patrik Stas: sort of the engine under the hood for dealing with the ledger credentials and wallet, or, alternatively, the new approach up by opting into in Dvdr and in the credentials

28
00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:38.549
Patrik Stas: instead of you know, vv. Our tools or in the SDK

29
00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:43.550
Patrik Stas: so this is. This was a huge Pr

30
00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:56.430
Patrik Stas: George has added the nice diagram of the update. Basically how the architecture will be for and how it looks now.

31
00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:04.339
Patrik Stas: we have also covered this in the previous call. So I'm. I'm not gonna repeat it again. But it's here

32
00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:09.229
Patrik Stas: for whoever is interested in details of what has been changed

33
00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:16.889
Patrik Stas: what is missing yet? in this piece is support for us. Car what?

34
00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:19.889
Patrik Stas: And that's something that

35
00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:22.369
Patrik Stas: I've put

36
00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:26.119
Patrik Stas: into in progress.

37
00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:29.220
Patrik Stas: in progress

38
00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:34.460
Patrik Stas: part of the agenda. Well, I should fix it, though, because

39
00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:43.409
Patrik Stas: it's hardly in the review, yet it's as I know the affords on. These are only starting. So

40
00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:47.380
Patrik Stas: i'll just slightly find this.

41
00:06:49.890 --> 00:07:00.329
Patrik Stas: Yeah. So we have a George Your phone initiative to implement Aries as car support

42
00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:15.799
Patrik Stas: what's also missing Here is the support for using these new libraries. when calling functions in the role of sure or approved verifier. So that's still something. I will have to work on.

43
00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:26.600
Patrik Stas: And then yeah, we have we have one more task in progress. Right now.

44
00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:31.970
Patrik Stas: as a who's created this new issue to support did key

45
00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:40.970
Patrik Stas: a res of C 300 sixty- which basically it's as a support for processing messages which

46
00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:48.760
Patrik Stas: instead of reading, instead of expecting this, as they say, naked keys

47
00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:55.810
Patrik Stas: to be in, you know, and included in the in the whatever they are. His message is

48
00:07:55.860 --> 00:08:12.400
Patrik Stas: is that format them accordingly to the Did key specification, which basically pre fixing them with some metadata. So it's easier to tell what sort of key we're dealing with.

49
00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:21.960
Patrik Stas: Yeah, and that's pretty much it Today's call is gonna be short.

50
00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:28.809
Patrik Stas: There's a upcoming work pieces we've discussed last week.

51
00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:33.070
Patrik Stas: and these are yet to be addressed.

52
00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:46.049
Patrik Stas: I think I think from up this point of view. I think this would be one of the top priorities now to remove a public agent structure, which

53
00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:50.460
Patrik Stas: as we found out

54
00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:52.470
Patrik Stas: in

55
00:08:53.170 --> 00:09:01.989
Patrik Stas: at this issue right here. Nobody. Nobody minds to have have removed, so that will be gone soon.

56
00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:10.880
Patrik Stas: yeah. And then secondly, I think we'll be focusing on

57
00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:23.969
Patrik Stas: eliminating, mediated connection in test so trying to liberate the code based from from coupling it with the

58
00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:40.100
Patrik Stas: and then surely the other points as well. But yeah, we need a main power, and and it's also time to be spend on this. So yeah, let's let's focus on the stuff we do in progress. And hopefully, something from these items

59
00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:42.279
Patrik Stas: we'll get started as well

60
00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:48.009
Patrik Stas: that being said I see that

61
00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:53.540
Patrik Stas: nobody has entered since the call started, which is fine.

62
00:09:53.590 --> 00:09:54.990
Patrik Stas: So

63
00:09:56.410 --> 00:09:58.820
Patrik Stas: oh, i'll

64
00:09:58.850 --> 00:10:02.059
Patrik Stas: I guess They also mark the end of the

65
00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:07.320
Patrik Stas: this podcast form call and now

66
00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:11.440
Patrik Stas: yeah, I'll

67
00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:12.310
okay.

68
00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:23.090
Patrik Stas: I'll tune hopefully with the more participation next week again. So until then cheers everybody who's been listening and thank you.
