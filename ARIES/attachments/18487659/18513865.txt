01:11:57	Steve McCown:	@Stephen Curran: I don't use OIDC a lot, so sorry I didn't have a good answer for your OIDC question.  However, I put a link to Oliver's SIOP slides at the top of the Implementer's WG wiki and that has more information:  https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/IWG/2020-07-02+Identity+WG+Implementers+Call
