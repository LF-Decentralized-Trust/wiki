00:08:07	Matthew Hailstone:	LOL
00:13:17	Drummond Reed:	Link to the wiki page Stephen was showing?

00:13:46	Drummond Reed:	Thanks
00:26:26	Drummond Reed:	So is it clear that JSON-LD is NOT being used at the envelope level, but MAY be used inside the envelope?
00:26:55	George Aristy:	"All of the envelope level formats are achieved through JOSE based structures. The encrypted formats uses a JWE structure, whereas the signed unencrypted format uses a JWS structure."
00:26:59	Kyle Den Hartog:	Yes, that’s correct.
00:27:09	Stephen Curran:	JSON-LD friendly messages in the envelope.
00:27:12	Drummond Reed:	Thx

00:27:30	Stephen Curran:	RFC Tobias is referencing ^^^

00:41:48	Tobias Looker:	For those interested please look here ^
00:56:31	Alex Blom:	OMEMO is worth looking at as well

00:58:17	Alex Blom:	https://conversations.im/omemo/
01:02:44	Michael Lodder:	omemo is just signal with AES-GCM
01:02:57	Michael Lodder:	and a different discovery protocol
01:03:26	Michael Lodder:	The main point is to have a single object that functions as the rachet for the group
01:05:40	Michael Lodder:	Megaolm and MLS have something like this
01:05:44	Michael Lodder:	MLS uses a TreeKEM
01:09:50	Paul Knowles:	DIDCOM over XMPP … https://github.com/Oskar-van-Deventer/indy-hipe/tree/didcom-over-xmpp/text/didcom-over-xmpp
01:16:06	Steve McCown:	Regarding OMEMO’s licensing, it looks like it is APLv2 licensed.  However, I’m reading that it imports Signal protocol, which is GPL3 licensed.  Is that true?
01:26:04	Drummond Reed:	One URL per protocol per relationship
01:26:58	Matthew Hailstone:	One URL per protocol <stop>
01:27:01	Matthew Hailstone:	?
01:30:01	Drummond Reed:	+1
01:33:50	Drummond Reed:	The ever-present nomenclature issue :-)
01:34:18	Kyle Den Hartog:	lol
01:34:25	Kyle Den Hartog:	That is indeed
01:37:50	Paul Knowles:	There are also members of Kantara Initiative Consent & Information Sharing WG that are working on wallet-type things. I’m trying to keep abreast of that work as there could certainly be good learning in places.
01:38:46	Paul Knowles:	Wallet Consortium required for standards!!!
