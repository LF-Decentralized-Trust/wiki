00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:39.059
Patrik Stas: Well, hello! Everyone tuning into 2,022 December 20 ninth ares. Call this week it's gonna be a short update.

2
00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.600
Patrik Stas: It's Florida.

3
00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.470
Patrik Stas: As for the

4
00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.370
Patrik Stas: stuff

5
00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.720
Patrik Stas: the stuff done this stuff done goes

6
00:02:51.910 --> 00:03:10.650
Patrik Stas: so we can skip over that for discussion. as there's there's no one to discuss with this week, so we jump right into the overview of the recent work. And most of it is actually stuff we've discussed on the previous call.

7
00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:15.570
Patrik Stas: So i'll just go through it. Fairly quickly. So

8
00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.809
Patrik Stas: those fair amount of refactoring done

9
00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:25.209
Patrik Stas: starting with the error handling. yeah, this has been in pretty detail

10
00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:29.039
Patrik Stas: overviewed. in the last call.

11
00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:36.949
Patrik Stas: but essentially we are splitting off error kinds per crate, so each grade has its own error. Kind?

12
00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:45.739
Patrik Stas: And there's clearly distinct mapping between these these error types.

13
00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:59.139
Patrik Stas: and most particularly where we originally had only one error type for both Libby 6 and a is the 6. Now we have 2 of them, so it's split it out for great

14
00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.930
Patrik Stas: and just overly much cleaner. Now.

15
00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:08.969
Patrik Stas: next up I've built on top of this Pr. Was a messaging

16
00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:16.209
Patrik Stas: create refactoring again. This has been a card last week. but

17
00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:27.410
Patrik Stas: And this just just briefly, this is adding this: this was extraction of the the dock. Create out of my every messages great

18
00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:37.850
Patrik Stas: and consequently also extraction of some shared pieces of code into a new create called shared Vcx.

19
00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:48.370
Patrik Stas: So so that's that. After that. there was this a big

20
00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:51.840
Patrik Stas: clean up which has been long covered you

21
00:04:51.920 --> 00:05:04.060
Patrik Stas: first that was the massive re reformatting across the board a lot of lot of lines has been touched here.

22
00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:12.110
Patrik Stas: Going with the mix with of 120 characters, with the cargo Smt

23
00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:16.869
Patrik Stas: so slightly slightly about the default.

24
00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:21.549
Patrik Stas: but most of the lines is never less. Not 120 lines

25
00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:28.310
Patrik Stas: due to as as a cargo formatting formatting works.

26
00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:33.679
Patrik Stas: So yeah, also lots of stock change here, but

27
00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:44.990
Patrik Stas: it was purely re reformatting is also adding a a job to Ci, where we check formatting of every every coming now

28
00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:53.640
Patrik Stas: followed by that another massive all those smaller

29
00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:57.160
Patrik Stas: almost clippy fixes.

30
00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:07.770
Patrik Stas: it's quite a bit of line still. But yeah, there's not really any functional changes

31
00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:11.819
Patrik Stas: just fixes as per clippy suggestions.

32
00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:19.120
Patrik Stas: not all of the slippy warnings has been applied some of them.

33
00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:23.659
Patrik Stas: and instead being put sort of on hold

34
00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:29.610
Patrik Stas: and you can see in a in the in the lip files.

35
00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:31.630
Patrik Stas: there's some.

36
00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:34.929
Patrik Stas: There's some clip. You warnings.

37
00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:48.319
Patrik Stas: There's some clippy links which are originally at the warning level, but has been overridden to allow. So we don't get currently warning out of these links.

38
00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:55.920
Patrik Stas: and but obviously going forward long term it will be nice to fix all of these as well

39
00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.690
Patrik Stas: so

40
00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:03.900
Patrik Stas: anybody funding to pick up a a small small enhancement task.

41
00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:18.439
Patrik Stas: you can just go ahead and do it. You know one of these lines in some of the leap Rs files. See what kind of warnings start popping up in clippy, and you know you can go ahead and fix it. It'll be definitely appreciated.

42
00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:28.870
Patrik Stas: Yeah. So that's that's As for the work done, goes there's few pieces in progress currently.

43
00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:35.170
Patrik Stas: So as from from George George's

44
00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:40.269
Patrik Stas: update on

45
00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:45.049
Patrik Stas: on this court George is now working on the

46
00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:49.950
Patrik Stas: implementing verifier api for credits.

47
00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:55.549
Patrik Stas: so yeah, so there's already like draft. Pr.

48
00:07:55.650 --> 00:07:57.210
Patrik Stas: she needs some

49
00:07:57.620 --> 00:08:01.609
Patrik Stas: probably tweaks, maybe conflict resolution. Yeah.

50
00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:10.399
Patrik Stas: But yeah, this shouldn't be, I guess. Too long. I i'm not sure if this is complete.

51
00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:12.990
Patrik Stas: but

52
00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:14.070
Patrik Stas: so

53
00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:18.180
Patrik Stas: that's a very far part. It should be easier

54
00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:19.790
Patrik Stas: almost.

55
00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:32.010
Patrik Stas: Yeah, okay. The verifier part with the credit should be easier than the issue. So according to George, this is almost done.

56
00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:37.849
Patrik Stas: and then following George's update here on this card.

57
00:08:38.049 --> 00:08:53.719
Patrik Stas: After After the very far pieces work piece is done, he'll move on to the issue Api's with credits, and, as he says hopefully, they're as straightforward as very far. Api is probably not, though. So that's that's true.

58
00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:58.249
Patrik Stas: we'll see how that goes, and how complex that gets

59
00:08:59.230 --> 00:09:08.619
Patrik Stas: so that's that's Here added this a new task one of the new issues which has been created in last week

60
00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:17.090
Patrik Stas: has been has been this video resolver.

61
00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:23.330
Patrik Stas: so obviously like video is kind of like first class citizen shouldn't be

62
00:09:25.010 --> 00:09:26.690
Patrik Stas: And

63
00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:28.220
Patrik Stas: we should

64
00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:30.590
Patrik Stas: we should adjust accordingly.

65
00:09:30.610 --> 00:09:34.289
Patrik Stas: with our approach in the code, so

66
00:09:34.510 --> 00:09:37.369
Patrik Stas: currently we do resolve.

67
00:09:39.270 --> 00:09:41.920
Patrik Stas: we we do have like

68
00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:43.700
Patrik Stas: so

69
00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:49.810
Patrik Stas: who implement a resolution of the Id service.

70
00:09:52.510 --> 00:09:56.459
Patrik Stas: According to a of a method.

71
00:09:56.910 --> 00:09:58.460
Patrik Stas: however.

72
00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:01.499
Patrik Stas: we should just come out.

73
00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:04.680
Patrik Stas: tweaked the Api to some more about the vo.

74
00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:08.069
Patrik Stas: and just get the service. Consequently from that

75
00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:10.259
Patrik Stas: is a side more of a side effect.

76
00:10:10.490 --> 00:10:15.670
Patrik Stas: or like part, you know. So it's it's just a part of the video. So

77
00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:17.729
Patrik Stas: we can

78
00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:23.060
Patrik Stas: is going as it is for the starter. we should implement some trait

79
00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:31.990
Patrik Stas: for the ddo resolver and implement. It did solve implementation which we currently focus on. But we

80
00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:39.139
Patrik Stas: as soon going forward, we can expect also adding the did in the the method.

81
00:10:39.610 --> 00:10:44.620
Patrik Stas: and we can also consider adding, support for like

82
00:10:44.770 --> 00:10:49.790
Patrik Stas: third party resolver, you know. so we could

83
00:10:51.410 --> 00:11:00.220
Patrik Stas: we could implement like the idea. You you need a resolver resolver which would actually enable us to resolve

84
00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:12.949
Patrik Stas: de videos across different blockchains. But obviously I use drawback of these approaches. It's relying on third party. It's not really so self sovereign anymore.

85
00:11:13.210 --> 00:11:26.119
Patrik Stas: but we'll see how that goes. We'll start with the did so, and did indeed. and this can be a kind of a experimental feature. I would love to have more native implementations, some sort of pluggable way.

86
00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:28.119
Patrik Stas: You could choose that

87
00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:37.159
Patrik Stas: the resolver implementations you are interested in, and you know, support Those like would be great to have did

88
00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:41.930
Patrik Stas: the id

89
00:11:42.030 --> 00:11:51.609
Patrik Stas: methods support. But i'm not sure how complex, how how difficult! What's the requirements of you, you know, resolving

90
00:11:52.070 --> 00:11:53.340
Patrik Stas: those methods

91
00:11:54.620 --> 00:11:57.610
Patrik Stas: so we'll see about that in the future.

92
00:12:00.830 --> 00:12:07.280
Patrik Stas: all right. that's that, and I guess some coming here at the bottom of our list.

93
00:12:08.390 --> 00:12:16.300
Patrik Stas: I moved the last Week's new task into the backlog part of our Wiki page.

94
00:12:16.590 --> 00:12:18.680
Patrik Stas: So

95
00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:21.569
Patrik Stas: yeah, we'll start picking up from here.

96
00:12:23.450 --> 00:12:28.170
Patrik Stas: Oh, there was one more a Pr. Which has been merged yesterday.

97
00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:35.500
Patrik Stas: and that was the levy 6 refactoring

98
00:12:35.850 --> 00:12:40.479
Patrik Stas: so I should. I should update the page here.

99
00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:49.810
Patrik Stas: So this is not exactly

100
00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:52.310
Patrik Stas: and down because we didn't really

101
00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:54.519
Patrik Stas: so it

102
00:12:56.210 --> 00:12:57.390
Patrik Stas: maybe

103
00:12:57.630 --> 00:13:09.290
Patrik Stas: i'll leave it here for now, because we didn't really fulfill this as it's written here. But what has been done is splitting of live vcx

104
00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:12.199
Patrik Stas: into like 2 modules.

105
00:13:12.410 --> 00:13:13.840
Patrik Stas: so

106
00:13:14.990 --> 00:13:18.580
Patrik Stas: so the way it will be 6 looks like now.

107
00:13:18.780 --> 00:13:27.040
Patrik Stas: is it this Api, c. And api Vcx Api, c. Is purely the original original. See Bindings.

108
00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:36.590
Patrik Stas: plus everything needed to make them work, and how to, and to make the tests around these to work.

109
00:13:36.650 --> 00:13:41.140
Patrik Stas: so this you details, but other than that, these are all

110
00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:44.609
Patrik Stas: the bindings, all the fi api's.

111
00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:46.330
Patrik Stas: and define here.

112
00:13:46.430 --> 00:13:50.859
Patrik Stas: And then we have another piece the sort of internal

113
00:13:50.930 --> 00:13:55.710
Patrik Stas: Libby 6 core, let's call it piece called api, vcx

114
00:13:55.760 --> 00:14:02.009
Patrik Stas: api, c. Is using Api, but we still not the other way around.

115
00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:06.600
Patrik Stas: And this is like the original so-called handle layer.

116
00:14:06.650 --> 00:14:12.889
Patrik Stas: and just some other Apis which which we are calling from Api sea layer

117
00:14:15.470 --> 00:14:17.349
Patrik Stas: in the Api global

118
00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:18.680
Patrik Stas: some module

119
00:14:20.130 --> 00:14:26.360
Patrik Stas: so we had. This kind of provides clear division. And now what basically what can be easily done?

120
00:14:26.810 --> 00:14:28.860
Patrik Stas: So you can build your own

121
00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.700
Patrik Stas: you can build your own.

122
00:14:32.890 --> 00:14:38.520
Patrik Stas: if I sort of wrapper. If I binding similar to Api, C,

123
00:14:38.570 --> 00:14:40.710
Patrik Stas: we can create like a new

124
00:14:40.910 --> 00:14:46.870
Patrik Stas: new create. It could be, perhaps even part of the bcx. Some sort of new module

125
00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:51.430
Patrik Stas: on top of Api sinks which

126
00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:56.209
Patrik Stas: which provides the the Fi Api

127
00:15:00.450 --> 00:15:07.039
Patrik Stas: So we we are currently doing this with a note. not Prs

128
00:15:07.370 --> 00:15:10.919
Patrik Stas: to basically build a new node wrapper.

129
00:15:11.610 --> 00:15:13.719
Patrik Stas: but those

130
00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:20.889
Patrik Stas: somebody interested in building slaughter rapper. So I think it should be now

131
00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:25.239
Patrik Stas: easier to do for sure

132
00:15:25.290 --> 00:15:29.449
Patrik Stas: to build it a P. To build it. Flatter

133
00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:30.910
Patrik Stas: brepper

134
00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.490
Patrik Stas: with the Api Vcx

135
00:15:34.170 --> 00:15:35.969
Patrik Stas: as a as a foundation.

136
00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:42.959
Patrik Stas: Okay? well, that being set, I think this covers truly everything

137
00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:44.580
Patrik Stas: and

138
00:15:46.450 --> 00:15:48.980
Patrik Stas: soon New year's coming so

139
00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:51.530
Patrik Stas: happy New Year and

140
00:15:52.450 --> 00:15:55.069
