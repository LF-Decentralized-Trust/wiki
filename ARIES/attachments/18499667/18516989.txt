08:05:47	 From  Sam Curren (TelegramSam) : https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/ARIES/2022-11-02+Aries+Working+Group+Call
08:08:36	 From  Colton Wolkins : I really liked the first one
08:09:01	 From  Alex : +1 for the first one. I like how it kinda symbolizes a selective disclosure
08:09:14	 From  Berend Sliedrecht : I also like prefer the first one, it is quite clear what the logo means. The other two need additional explaining as to what they mean
08:10:20	 From  Stephen Curran : Alex -- are you Alex Metcalf or a different Alex?
08:10:57	 From  Stephen Curran : Def not Alex Metcalf :-).  Then your comment counts.  The selective disclosure concept was from Alex Metcalf.
08:11:03	 From  Alex : Different Alex
08:11:06	 From  Alex : Alex Andrei
08:11:13	 From  Stephen Curran : üëç
08:12:01	 From  Alex : Alex think alike lol
08:17:37	 From  Colton Wolkins : What I really like from the first one is it symbolizes documentation (looks like a document) and taking a portion of the document out (rather than the whole thing).
08:17:59	 From  Stephen Curran : üëç
09:02:10	 From  Timo Glastra : Have to drop! thanks
