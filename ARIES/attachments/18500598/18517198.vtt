Lance Byrd: Okay, let's see quick updates.

32
00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:32.030
Lance Byrd: I am don't know of anything with Ary's agent test harness.

33
00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:38.670
Lance Byrd: Dmitri, are you interested in? Did Com. V. 2.

34
00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:45.260
DMITRY MARTYNOV: No.

35

Lance Byrd: Hmm. Okay.

37
00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:01.219
Lance Byrd: Well, let's see here.

38
00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:13.689
Lance Byrd: I'll put you on mute

39
00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:16.590
Lance Byrd: if I can. Let's see.

40
00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:26.489
Lance Byrd: Give me 1 s to claim ownership.

41
00:05:53.720 --> 00:06:00.169
Lance Byrd: Yeah, give me give me 1 s i'll. I'll claim host, and then we can get started.

42
00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:06.560
Lance Byrd: yeah, okay.

43
00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:25.129
Lance Byrd: Okay, I have the power. Now.

44
00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:41.069
Alex: Okay, do we need to record the meetings?

45
00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:47.989
Lance Byrd: no, it I believe it auto records. So, though I can double check that

46
00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:50.599
Alex: I see the direct button.

47
00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:52.270
Alex: the recording. Yeah.

48
00:06:57.530 --> 00:06:59.270
Rodolfo Miranda: yeah, it is. It is recording.

49
00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:02.300
Rodolfo Miranda: I, in the regarding them, got past the slack

50
00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:05.659
Rodolfo Miranda: or not. To this somewhere I don't know.

51
00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:12.060
DMITRY MARTYNOV: No. Just look

52
00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:20.009
Lance Byrd: okay. I have ejected Demetrius. Sorry for that.

53
00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:21.720
Lance Byrd: let's

54
00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:23.960
Lance Byrd: go back to sharing.

55
00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:29.660
Lance Byrd: That's the difficulty, I guess, of an open meeting.

56
00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:35.389
Lance Byrd: okay. And of course.

57
00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:41.009
Lance Byrd: now, my okay, My screen has changed

58
00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:43.380
Lance Byrd: all right.

59
00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:45.259
Lance Byrd: Yeah. Sorry about that. Everybody

60
00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:51.160
Lance Byrd: Yes, we are recording. I think that that happens automatically for us

61
00:07:51.710 --> 00:08:05.019
Lance Byrd: all right updates. So every sage you test harness, I haven't done anything with that I've been meaning to. But I've been buried in kind of basically a release that I need to get done for this week

62
00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:10.700
Lance Byrd: any anybody done anything with Aries agent test harness or Arizascar

63
00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:12.480
Lance Byrd: stuff.

64
00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:14.830
Lance Byrd: Most of that should be good.

65
00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:19.079
Lance Byrd: I did post in our chat channel.

66
00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:22.400
Lance Byrd: the

67
00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:27.169
Lance Byrd: I, T-mail had posted about how they're hoping to handle

68
00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:32.849
Lance Byrd: connections in Aj. Which is something that we've talked about with Akapi and hawk and and do this work.

69
00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.450
Lance Byrd: so I did post.

70
00:08:41.659 --> 00:08:45.699
Lance Byrd: I'm: sorry. I think I know how to use the Internet Here we go.

71
00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:56.729
Lance Byrd: yeah, basically T-mo gave some suggestions about their connection record and what they'd like to do. I think, hockey and took a look at it. Did you want to say anything about it hack on

72
00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:09.969
hakan: Nothing particularly it it it it look like it is very similar to the exchange. But I think Timo replied back to that comment, and said it was related to it. Convey one, if I remember correctly.

73
00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:12.590
hakan: So

74
00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:23.399
hakan: yeah, I mean all overall. In general it looks very similar to what the endpoint of the exchange would do like, Look at a public that if you find that resolve it. And

75
00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:26.050
hakan: yeah, established a connection. Basically

76
00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:27.250
Okay.

77
00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:29.129
Lance Byrd: yeah, Very good.

78
00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:30.800
Lance Byrd: Thank you.

79
00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:40.900
Lance Byrd: And then, yeah, for today the topics that I've posted so Nick Reynolds posted his lib. Pdp.

80
00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:51.370
Lance Byrd: did calm contribution as a pull request that might be worth looking at. I started to look at it, but I haven't made it completely through yet.

81
00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:56.360
Lance Byrd: essentially, yeah, he gives quite a bit of information here.

82
00:09:56.770 --> 00:10:00.039
Lance Byrd: Did anybody else take a look at this yet?

83
00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:05.270
Lance Byrd: It's it's nice, because

84
00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:06.730
Lance Byrd: yeah, it's

85
00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:11.780
Lance Byrd: the Pdp. Has quite a bit of

86
00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:19.330
Lance Byrd: functionality added to it, including there's some people who have built like bluetooth transport

87
00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:22.139
Lance Byrd: support, and things like that.

88
00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:26.710
Lance Byrd: Anybody else know more about it.

89
00:10:31.510 --> 00:10:32.230
Lance Byrd: Yeah.

90
00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:35.270
Lance Byrd: something to be aware of. So I put it up there.

91
00:10:35.830 --> 00:10:39.990
Lance Byrd: yeah, i'm looking forward to going through that

92
00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:46.899
Lance Byrd: and then I thought for today we could essentially keep working on our

93
00:10:48.170 --> 00:10:56.600
Lance Byrd: our Aries in Route Profile 3. But let's go around and do updates first. If anybody has updates from their projects, and how it's going.

94
00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:00.960
Lance Byrd: Maybe, Bruce, if you want to start.

95
00:11:02.170 --> 00:11:06.979
Yeah, nothing's happening now. Our students are taking their

96
00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:09.140
their when they're

97
00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:10.720
holiday break.

98
00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:17.989
I I do have some questions about

99
00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:20.489
Well, just one question which is.

100
00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:23.930
did we get them started correctly.

101
00:11:24.370 --> 00:11:26.959
We have them

102
00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:30.989
implement a did exchange protocol.

103
00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:34.279
but I believe that exchanges for the

104
00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:37.370
so i'm not quite sure what we should have them.

105
00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:41.359
Lance Byrd: Yeah, that that seems to be a

106
00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:48.030
Lance Byrd: repeating confusion between did come V. One and V 2. It's not

107
00:11:48.410 --> 00:11:54.650
Lance Byrd: I guess it's not intuitive to think that there is not a did exchange a step

108
00:11:54.750 --> 00:12:02.230
Lance Byrd: that that was part of maybe the simplification of Didcom and did come v 2

109
00:12:05.170 --> 00:12:07.920
Lance Byrd: I'm: glad the simplification.

110
00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:22.709
Lance Byrd: Yeah. So essentially receiving a did company to a message is essentially how you're establishing the connection. Did we want? Is is there a good guide

111
00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:27.440
Lance Byrd: or

112
00:12:30.050 --> 00:12:33.760
Lance Byrd: that. The

113
00:12:33.830 --> 00:12:37.739
Rodolfo Miranda: I think the Hello! Work.

114
00:12:42.930 --> 00:12:50.030
Lance Byrd: I guess the thing is the but this probably doesn't warn someone that

115
00:12:51.310 --> 00:12:54.730
Lance Byrd: things have changed between did come V. One and V 2,

116
00:12:55.370 --> 00:13:01.420
Rodolfo Miranda: for instance, they would. They would be natural. It's not related to to be one.

117
00:13:02.470 --> 00:13:03.689
Lance Byrd: Yeah. So me

118
00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.650
Bruce Conrad: that's actually fine for the students who Haven't encountered V. One.

119
00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:09.210
it's just challenging

120
00:13:09.470 --> 00:13:11.240
those of us who are guiding them.

121
00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:14.090
Lance Byrd: Yeah, yeah.

122
00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:15.310
Lance Byrd: There enough.

123
00:13:15.450 --> 00:13:16.349
That will help.

124
00:13:21.730 --> 00:13:24.030
Lance Byrd: Yeah, I think.

125
00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:35.000
Rodolfo Miranda: I I I guess it. Yeah, if you follow the starting. And you see, starting using an ending, I did come connection we got you how to establish

126
00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:37.599
Rodolfo Miranda: normal connection. Just a simple message.

127
00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:38.710
Rodolfo Miranda: I think that's

128
00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:40.160
Rodolfo Miranda: the way

129
00:13:40.410 --> 00:13:41.589
Rodolfo Miranda: can we handle

130
00:13:41.930 --> 00:13:44.030
Rodolfo Miranda: easily without? Did it Change.

131
00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:51.869
Rodolfo Miranda: Of course that's depend on on the library. Because, if, as I can point out, if you have a library in, be one.

132
00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:55.300
Rodolfo Miranda: and it's been translated to V 2,

133
00:13:55.610 --> 00:13:58.380
Rodolfo Miranda: then that library may require something

134
00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:00.400
Rodolfo Miranda: like like a protocol to

135
00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:04.669
Rodolfo Miranda: to establish the final connection and sit there in the database.

136
00:14:05.110 --> 00:14:05.720
Rodolfo Miranda: and

137
00:14:06.090 --> 00:14:06.950
bye

138
00:14:07.010 --> 00:14:11.050
Rodolfo Miranda: didn't come. Be too simple state. It can be 2. It's just one message

139
00:14:11.610 --> 00:14:14.120
Rodolfo Miranda: one way, and then you can replay back

140
00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:16.389
Rodolfo Miranda: and established the connection on the other side.

141
00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:21.479
And thank you, Rudol. That's that's helpful. I will study this

142
00:14:21.570 --> 00:14:26.940
and the students are actually, if I understand it correctly, building their own.

143
00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:29.369
I did call you 2 libraries so

144
00:14:30.210 --> 00:14:31.480
Rodolfo Miranda: right right.

145
00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:37.280
Rodolfo Miranda: but they do speak python, so I think I think

146
00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:38.740
Rodolfo Miranda: so. They go now.

147
00:14:39.230 --> 00:14:42.740
Rodolfo Miranda: They can use it. This is a notebook, so they can test it on

148
00:14:42.970 --> 00:14:44.230
Rodolfo Miranda: on the cloud phone.

149
00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:46.440
hey? Thank you.

150
00:14:47.830 --> 00:14:49.089
Lance Byrd: Yeah. Fair enough.

151
00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:54.550
Lance Byrd: Okay. Thanks. Bruce. let's see.

152
00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:58.560
Lance Byrd: How can you want to give any updates for this week.

153
00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:08.379
hakan: I don't think I have any points for for this week.

154
00:15:08.530 --> 00:15:11.029
Lance Byrd: Okay, there was no additional

155
00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:16.930
hakan: yeah topics that I worked on related to this computer. But maybe Judith has something to yeah.

156
00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:18.200
hakan: that

157
00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:24.109
Judith Högerl: And not really, unfortunately, because it was sick during the one weeks.

158
00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:27.219
Lance Byrd: Yeah, Sorry about that. Yeah, that's that's

159
00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:31.330
Lance Byrd: a lot of people out sick right now and then, of course, holiday stuff. So

160
00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:39.889
Lance Byrd: yeah, fair enough. I do think. Did we talk about it before, I guess. we. We won't meet next week.

161
00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:43.849
Lance Byrd: I think so. I think I updated the calendar

162
00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:48.400
Lance Byrd: for us. We'll meet again. Let's see here.

163
00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:57.620
Lance Byrd: just double checking

164
00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:04.030
Lance Byrd: It' be January Ninth: yeah. The ninth

165
00:16:04.190 --> 00:16:15.040
Lance Byrd: back. Yeah, very good. And I just want to make sure. I removed it. Yeah, I did remove it from the calendar. So they gave me permission for that. That's right. So

166
00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:17.919
Lance Byrd: good stuff. Okay.

167
00:16:18.190 --> 00:16:23.409
Lance Byrd: And then Alex and Rodo, either. Either of you have updates you want to give

168
00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:28.149
Rodolfo Miranda: and nothing on my side.

169
00:16:28.350 --> 00:16:29.160
Lance Byrd: Okay.

170
00:16:30.110 --> 00:16:31.500
Lance Byrd: Yeah. So

171
00:16:31.850 --> 00:16:32.680
Lance Byrd: okay.

172
00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:39.550
Lance Byrd: great. And i'm not missing anybody. Yeah, okay, good, All right. So let's take a look.

173
00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:42.299
Lance Byrd: at the

174
00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:49.690
Lance Byrd: Aries in our profile. 3 and yeah, we could add some things to this and just go through it.

175
00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:56.589
Lance Byrd: I think most of you have seen it. But I don't think we've actually just, you know, taken a session here

176
00:16:56.650 --> 00:16:58.259
Lance Byrd: to go through it

177
00:16:59.030 --> 00:17:00.860
Lance Byrd: if that's good with everybody.

178
00:17:03.570 --> 00:17:04.630
Lance Byrd: Okay.

179
00:17:04.859 --> 00:17:06.970
Lance Byrd: So

180
00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:12.050
Lance Byrd: is everyone happy with this initial

181
00:17:13.010 --> 00:17:15.240
Lance Byrd: base requirements

182
00:17:16.310 --> 00:17:24.069
Lance Byrd: for a. P. 3. What do we need to add, we have the spec. Did come V. 2, which includes these protocols

183
00:17:24.410 --> 00:17:25.530
Lance Byrd: on top.

184
00:17:26.170 --> 00:17:30.460
Lance Byrd: I think it is interesting that basic messaging is separate.

185
00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:34.049
Lance Byrd: Am I right? I think

186
00:17:34.370 --> 00:17:36.019
Lance Byrd: it's it's down here

187
00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:40.160
Lance Byrd: is that do we

188
00:17:40.210 --> 00:17:44.060
Lance Byrd: feel like that's right. To be separated from

189
00:17:44.730 --> 00:17:46.370
Lance Byrd: the base requirements?

190
00:17:47.790 --> 00:18:05.170
hakan: Is from my point of view it makes sense. Because once we have the discomfort, we want to use it for different purposes. And basic messaging is one of those purposes. Basically I would compare it to having this protocol similar to credential exchange protocols.

191
00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:11.439
hakan: But yeah, we do have base requirements for credential exchange. Hmm.

192
00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:16.780
Nice.

193
00:18:16.910 --> 00:18:26.109
Lance Byrd: It it. Yeah, it does seem a little weird to me that that there could be a did come implementation without basic messaging.

194
00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:30.079
Lance Byrd: and then yeah, you're right that then we're showing

195
00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:32.060
Lance Byrd: me

196
00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:34.370
Lance Byrd: transfer of credentials.

197
00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:36.940
Lance Byrd: I would imagine.

198
00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:37.830
Well.

199
00:18:37.930 --> 00:18:45.579
Lance Byrd: I guess I guess it doesn't matter to to to say which one's more important or or more common. But yeah, any any thoughts on that?

200
00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:50.169
Rodolfo Miranda: Yeah. Well, but basically, it's just for a chat application. At least this

201
00:18:50.810 --> 00:18:53.509
Rodolfo Miranda: it's for 2 person talking right.

202
00:18:55.490 --> 00:18:58.210
Rodolfo Miranda: This is a specific type of message.

203
00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:00.720
Rodolfo Miranda: but I only I think it's

204
00:19:00.950 --> 00:19:03.159
Rodolfo Miranda: only can be used for it for a chat. Right?

205
00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:05.010
Lance Byrd: Yeah.

206
00:19:05.830 --> 00:19:08.160
Lance Byrd: anyway. So the

207
00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:10.339
Lance Byrd: did. Then Did we want to

208
00:19:10.490 --> 00:19:14.350
Lance Byrd: peel this portion out in terms of

209
00:19:15.470 --> 00:19:19.699
Lance Byrd: being able? The the wacky? Well, it says Wacky Pecks. But

210
00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:28.889
Lance Byrd: like you did come. Does that something we want to separate as well, or or at least comment that that we think you should, or do. We want to leave it here.

211
00:19:31.570 --> 00:19:40.360
hakan: I would, I mean, if if you look into the first IP a IP, one and 2. I think

212
00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:53.340
hakan: those are really related to Aries, and this is really related to issue Holder Verifier for the issuing credentials, and presenting credentials like as what, what what it's supposed to do.

213
00:19:53.360 --> 00:20:12.740
hakan: And if you look into the a. I. P. 3 point oh, also from the same perspective. And that's the If, then, I think this is fine, the way it is because we're covering everything related to didcom support functionalities to issue. We'll be able to issue and present credentials.

214
00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:17.270
Rodolfo Miranda: Yeah, I got you. I we yeah.

215
00:20:19.270 --> 00:20:20.550
Lance Byrd: Okay.

216
00:20:20.850 --> 00:20:24.610
perspective, because we're asking our students to

217
00:20:24.870 --> 00:20:29.029
implement, I guess, to follow the spec for Deadcon V. 2, I guess.

218
00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:30.020
and

219
00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:34.049
we don't intend to issue credentials or required proofs.

220
00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:43.250
we'll, we'll be defining a a custom. Pico-specific protocol on top of that we're going to go

221
00:20:43.630 --> 00:20:46.559
so from that perspective, it would be nice if

222
00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:47.809
if

223
00:20:47.990 --> 00:20:53.210
if our students could say, yeah, we're a IP 3 3 with no options.

224
00:20:55.890 --> 00:20:57.230
whereas

225
00:20:57.550 --> 00:21:00.380
if if there's a credential exchange and proof

226
00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:05.329
portion that's required to be a IP 3. Then they won't reach that.

227
00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:09.070
But that's a that's a strange way to think about it.

228
00:21:12.350 --> 00:21:18.929
Rodolfo Miranda: Yeah, that makes sense that a good point awesome. Yeah, yeah, for sure.

229
00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:22.580
Lance Byrd: And and it kind of gets back to what we talked about before, where

230
00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.170
Lance Byrd: we're trying to help people to know

231
00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:30.260
Lance Byrd: the common path, but also, like the

232
00:21:30.410 --> 00:21:34.219
Lance Byrd: the the the simplest

233
00:21:34.330 --> 00:21:39.569
Lance Byrd: support that they need First, in order to kind of add the optional things.

234
00:21:39.670 --> 00:21:52.230
Lance Byrd: and so we've even talked about Wacky being something like oh, you know, like he did come simple you know, not even implementing everything from from like he did come. So

235
00:21:52.340 --> 00:22:18.420
Lance Byrd: I do I. I I am concerned that someone new coming in. They don't really know and then they see this and they're saying, okay, like this is what I need to support. And then they get into like, why he did come, let's say, and then they're like, Wow! This is a lot of work. Maybe I won't. Do this, you know. this is these are the lessons of Jf: which, By the way, I I met with Sharon from Jf.

236
00:22:18.430 --> 00:22:20.010
Lance Byrd: this week

237
00:22:20.110 --> 00:22:24.290
Lance Byrd: and just was trying to convey to her that

238
00:22:26.180 --> 00:22:46.549
Lance Byrd: it it was really valuable that they kind of created to the Jff challenge to have these multiple tracks with O. I, DC. And and and did come. Now they are focused on transferring credentials, but because they, you know, created a didcom track. And and Alex worked with,

239
00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:51.029
Lance Byrd: Schnor and Brian Richter

240
00:22:51.340 --> 00:22:59.750
Lance Byrd: and which M. Maybe, Alex, if if you want to give any of the updates on that, you can in a second. But

241
00:23:01.390 --> 00:23:08.150
Lance Byrd: I guess the lessons learned from that is, well. Part of the reason that this group group meets is because of of

242
00:23:08.350 --> 00:23:17.190
Lance Byrd: the difficulty that that those groups went through as they were coming up to speed. on did come, and specifically did come V. 2.

243
00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:23.420
Lance Byrd: And so yeah I I that's why this concerns me

244
00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:25.820
Lance Byrd: the way that it is.

245
00:23:26.530 --> 00:23:30.960
Lance Byrd: Those are my thoughts, Alex. Any any updates on Jf: for thoughts on those things.

246
00:23:31.740 --> 00:23:37.250
Alex: Yeah, I mean, I think what you're saying that makes sense like also in terms of like the walkie-pack specification

247
00:23:37.270 --> 00:23:45.680
Alex: like in the If J. Meetings you're mentioning how like we need to upgrade, to like 3 point, one and 3 point, 2 to like issue multiple credentials at the same time.

248
00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:54.820
Alex: So from that perspective I think that the issue in 6 and exchanging of credential is only going to get like more complicated in terms of like

249
00:23:55.280 --> 00:24:00.319
Alex: I think you can break it down to like, hey? You can send the credential

250
00:24:00.580 --> 00:24:13.179
Alex: like, hey? You can request a credential before sending one, or like, hey? You can request multiple before sending one. Or you can request multiple before sending multiple. That's like the different configuration of walkie packs per se. And yeah, I think

251
00:24:14.060 --> 00:24:20.609
Alex: it's relatively high degree to entry. But I hope that most developers won't have to

252
00:24:20.670 --> 00:24:24.219
Alex: right the low level code of doing the per call exchange

253
00:24:25.590 --> 00:24:33.390
Alex: and they just have to worry about like the business logic of what credential they're sending through. At least that's how i'm beginning. And

254
00:24:33.410 --> 00:24:36.889
Alex: an an agent on my behalf like i'm not trying to

255
00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:43.770
Alex: If I were to be a developer to use an agent, I wouldn't go ahead and like you come in my own for a call. I would just kind of like

256
00:24:43.890 --> 00:24:48.060
Alex: whatever that agent protocol has, I will just work with that

257
00:24:48.540 --> 00:24:49.230
Lance Byrd: yeah

258
00:24:49.430 --> 00:24:50.579
Alex: below my box.

259
00:24:52.910 --> 00:24:55.480
Lance Byrd: But just

260
00:24:57.210 --> 00:25:03.130
Lance Byrd: see. I I guess one of the things when I was talking to share, and and

261
00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:13.119
Lance Byrd: she had done a she did a presentation actually at diff. The the the I think interop meeting, which is what sparked me to want to meet with her.

262
00:25:13.950 --> 00:25:14.590
Lance Byrd: but

263
00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:29.129
Lance Byrd: the I I my sense is that everyone came out of this, or at least Sharon and people who are watching closely. They came out of it, thinking okay did come is

264
00:25:29.330 --> 00:25:30.850
Lance Byrd: complicated.

265
00:25:30.890 --> 00:25:41.979
Lance Byrd: and so they didn't make as much progress as the Id see. What do they call it? DC. Or something track. And what was the other track? Was it?

266
00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:45.470
Alex: It was a Vc. Api like the Http

267
00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:48.309
Alex: copy. Yeah.

268
00:25:48.370 --> 00:25:57.470
Lance Byrd: Yeah. Okay. So so my yeah, if if everyone comes out of that, and and what I tried to explain in the diff interrupt meeting is

269
00:25:57.810 --> 00:26:02.889
Lance Byrd: okay. Well, part of the reason that that did come you know, maybe went slower is.

270
00:26:03.390 --> 00:26:13.030
Lance Byrd: for one thing, we're in the middle of we're in this, you know. Space of, you know, did come V. One implementations existing, and did come V. 2 implementations being very new.

271
00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:25.509
Lance Byrd: and you know teams having to decide. Are we going to do V. One or V 2? And then, you know, a. V 2 team kind of formed, and people are building their own implementations because they want to learn.

272
00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:33.449
Lance Byrd: but then, you know, there's all these pain points about crypto, and even just did methods and things like that.

273
00:26:33.730 --> 00:26:39.400
Alex: so yeah, yeah, I I agree that that is more complicated.

274
00:26:39.630 --> 00:26:43.840
Alex: I wouldn't say it's necessarily like more complicated. I think that the problem there is that

275
00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:55.379
Alex: the other 2 groups had, like more tooling available to the developers. So like right, Imagine if, like Chappy, had a problem between like http one and like http 2 right?

276
00:26:55.520 --> 00:26:58.940
Alex: But everybody knows http which protocol to use.

277
00:26:59.180 --> 00:27:01.830
Alex: So that's kind of like the struggles that we were encountering

278
00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:05.929
Alex: with our implementation, so like a lot of like the low level stuff.

279
00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:10.180
Alex: was not matching up whether it would like Chappy and O. I, DC. Connect.

280
00:27:10.270 --> 00:27:14.629
Alex: They already had the libraries kind of like working together, and all they had to do is implement the flow.

281
00:27:15.050 --> 00:27:20.370
Alex: Whether the the problems that we had was like slightly different than those.

282
00:27:20.620 --> 00:27:22.589
Alex: So yeah, that that's why I think like

283
00:27:22.730 --> 00:27:26.199
Alex: from like a big company to perspective, and also like we kind of like started late

284
00:27:26.270 --> 00:27:34.819
Alex: so trying to travel through all those low-level a problem. We didn't like anticipate for that so yeah, that's kind of like the

285
00:27:35.260 --> 00:27:38.489
Alex: the issue there, because, yeah, like Brian was able to.

286
00:27:38.730 --> 00:27:42.830
Alex: I talked to Brian like recently, and he was able to work like the the chappy.

287
00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:47.819
Alex: The extension in like 2 days. Seems like everything was already there, and

288
00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:51.309
Alex: you can damage happy pretty much by just simply copying

289
00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:53.640
Alex: and switching a couple of variables around, and

290
00:27:53.710 --> 00:27:54.760
that that would be it.

291
00:27:54.790 --> 00:27:55.790
Alex: So. Yeah.

292
00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:03.459
Lance Byrd: So so it is. Is anyone else in this group

293
00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:07.759
Lance Byrd: kind of concerned about those things or

294
00:28:08.730 --> 00:28:17.760
Lance Byrd: Is this something that we, you know we're just. We'd have a recency bias, and you know our own experience type.

295
00:28:18.620 --> 00:28:20.000
Lance Byrd: Bias is it?

296
00:28:21.180 --> 00:28:26.940
Lance Byrd: Should it be our focus as part of the aip 3.0

297
00:28:27.030 --> 00:28:32.299
Lance Byrd: to make it very clear kind of what is

298
00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:49.090
Lance Byrd: most common and what's available for for developers as tooling and for us to focus on, you know, making sure that that the tooling that's needed is a high high priority, and and that the community aries community and beyond has it?

299
00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:56.989
Lance Byrd: How how much should those kinds of thoughts be affecting? Aip? 3 3.

300
00:28:58.940 --> 00:29:10.010
Alex: Yeah. I personally think we should try to pretty much figure out the minimum basic requirements, right? Because right now, if you use it can be 2, you're most likely using the peer and not using any other did method

301
00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:16.219
Alex: and that's because of the library support. Right? It's not because people don't want to use other good methods.

302
00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:20.720
Alex: and whenever you try to integrate different methods, it's relatively challenging.

303
00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:23.670
Alex: for do you come libraries?

304
00:29:23.850 --> 00:29:33.399
Alex: So you're trying to figure out like a minimum set of requirements like signature schemes, elliptic curves that we're using for like an agent. Just so they can talk to another agent.

305
00:29:33.580 --> 00:29:36.320
Alex: It's I think, would be helpful. Yeah.

306
00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:43.040
Lance Byrd: other thoughts.

307
00:29:47.740 --> 00:29:49.930
I think.

308
00:29:50.340 --> 00:29:55.309
Rodolfo Miranda: Well, they IP shouldn't matter on the what tooling, or or maybe

309
00:29:55.900 --> 00:30:01.669
Rodolfo Miranda: work on the tooling side. But working on putting what is at this minimum

310
00:30:01.700 --> 00:30:02.520
Rodolfo Miranda: on

311
00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:08.899
Rodolfo Miranda: the minimal protocols. maybe even go farther down on this protocol. We are using that way.

312
00:30:09.500 --> 00:30:13.650
Rodolfo Miranda: for example, Static Pr. D. Ids.

313
00:30:13.830 --> 00:30:18.809
Rodolfo Miranda: that's 3 type of period. I I go theta one and 2, I think.

314
00:30:18.970 --> 00:30:19.710
Rodolfo Miranda: Just

315
00:30:19.730 --> 00:30:24.180
Rodolfo Miranda: so. Say which one and that way also, maybe on the mediator.

316
00:30:24.390 --> 00:30:28.999
Rodolfo Miranda: How we put the routine did in the Survey standpoint that to agree? And

317
00:30:29.090 --> 00:30:34.189
Rodolfo Miranda: how are we gonna do it for a IP 3? And if you do it that way

318
00:30:34.610 --> 00:30:35.530
Rodolfo Miranda: your

319
00:30:35.590 --> 00:30:37.889
Rodolfo Miranda: your case will pass right right.

320
00:30:38.140 --> 00:30:39.510
Oh, that's I do

321
00:30:39.750 --> 00:30:40.610
with the helpful.

322
00:30:43.550 --> 00:30:49.980
Lance Byrd: So so is that. How? How would you like to document those things

323
00:30:50.540 --> 00:30:55.589
Rodolfo Miranda: here? Well, we have some some sense, for, for example, this feature

324
00:30:55.850 --> 00:30:59.230
Rodolfo Miranda: 6, 27.

325
00:30:59.350 --> 00:31:04.330
Rodolfo Miranda: Some current, says he's gonna update that to about. He's gonna create a new one

326
00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:05.970
Rodolfo Miranda: with that in mind

327
00:31:06.490 --> 00:31:07.240
at least.

328
00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:13.580
Rodolfo Miranda: so he he's gonna change that. That was. I mentioned the last eighties call last week.

329
00:31:14.890 --> 00:31:15.980
Lance Byrd: Okay.

330
00:31:16.550 --> 00:31:18.999
Rodolfo Miranda: probably they are. We should put like a

331
00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:22.319
Rodolfo Miranda: that if you are using

332
00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:28.330
Rodolfo Miranda: Did Ps. With a mediator, you should put a service standpoint in this this way.

333
00:31:28.570 --> 00:31:31.110
Rodolfo Miranda: right? So everybody can understand

334
00:31:31.410 --> 00:31:34.510
Rodolfo Miranda: when they receive a routine did on that part.

335
00:31:34.730 --> 00:31:36.190
Rodolfo Miranda: What can be

336
00:31:36.290 --> 00:31:37.080
structure?

337
00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:48.130
Lance Byrd: let's see.

338
00:31:50.620 --> 00:31:54.470
Lance Byrd: Can you say that again? using? Did peers in a mediator?

339
00:31:54.900 --> 00:31:57.330
Rodolfo Miranda: Yeah, when when you when you use it.

340
00:31:57.780 --> 00:32:03.829
Rodolfo Miranda: Listen here. We were agreeing where we are going to do. Did it come? Be 2? We did. Pr: right.

341
00:32:03.860 --> 00:32:05.449
Rodolfo Miranda: That's the minimum.

342
00:32:05.850 --> 00:32:07.750
Lance Byrd: If you use a mediator.

343
00:32:07.930 --> 00:32:11.569
Rodolfo Miranda: The Mediator give you a routine. Did

344
00:32:12.550 --> 00:32:15.829
Rodolfo Miranda: that route in the Id will be part of your service

345
00:32:15.930 --> 00:32:17.870
Rodolfo Miranda: in in your did document.

346
00:32:18.130 --> 00:32:18.890
Rodolfo Miranda: so

347
00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:23.239
Rodolfo Miranda: we should agree in a way where we should put

348
00:32:23.430 --> 00:32:24.700
Rodolfo Miranda: that the Id

349
00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:26.090
Rodolfo Miranda: that in the Id

350
00:32:27.320 --> 00:32:30.270
Rodolfo Miranda: so because they the specification is not that clear?

351
00:32:30.670 --> 00:32:38.020
Rodolfo Miranda: There's a field called Routing Keys. That's a you and I that's a threat on the

352
00:32:38.500 --> 00:32:40.510
Rodolfo Miranda: on on the disc

353
00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:42.730
Rodolfo Miranda: chat

354
00:32:43.010 --> 00:32:45.180
Rodolfo Miranda: regarding that. And I

355
00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:53.149
Rodolfo Miranda: I say something. Then Stevens say another option, Timo, another one Brian different one. So

356
00:32:53.220 --> 00:32:57.600
Rodolfo Miranda: there's many, many way to to do this, and i'm and D. And this is the same.

357
00:33:00.430 --> 00:33:01.160
Lance Byrd: Yeah.

358
00:33:03.050 --> 00:33:03.820
Lance Byrd: Okay.

359
00:33:13.350 --> 00:33:15.329
Lance Byrd: so

360
00:33:17.690 --> 00:33:20.409
Lance Byrd: Any other thoughts in terms of breaking out?

361
00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:27.860
Lance Byrd: Well, Wacky did come, or Wackypex, as it used to be called

362
00:33:28.370 --> 00:33:31.209
Lance Byrd: breaking it out into a separate section.

363
00:33:34.060 --> 00:33:38.019
Bruce Conrad: I would like to put in another plug for

364
00:33:38.150 --> 00:33:41.599
Bruce Conrad: for following the layering of trust over IP:

365
00:33:41.990 --> 00:33:43.110
Lance Byrd: Yeah.

366
00:33:43.290 --> 00:33:45.620
it did come v 2

367
00:33:46.030 --> 00:33:52.690
Lance Byrd: on layer 2 if I follow the spec. And perhaps the static peer did

368
00:33:53.260 --> 00:33:53.920
leaders.

369
00:33:54.210 --> 00:33:56.339
Bruce Conrad: and i'm a IP, 3

370
00:33:56.520 --> 00:34:04.000
at layer of of of trust over IP. If I, in addition, have at least one

371
00:34:04.410 --> 00:34:08.390
I implement at least one method for exchanging credentials.

372
00:34:10.409 --> 00:34:11.750
Lance Byrd: Yeah.

373
00:34:12.889 --> 00:34:15.029
hakan: I I think

374
00:34:15.310 --> 00:34:26.620
hakan: I I would argue that a IP 3 is actually having components or Rfcs from all 3 bottom layers like on the bottom. We have, for example, the static period

375
00:34:26.679 --> 00:34:33.160
hakan: is one of the features that are supposed to be implemented on the area of agent layer. We do have the did come

376
00:34:33.639 --> 00:34:36.199
hakan: as an encryption

377
00:34:36.659 --> 00:34:37.669
hakan: envelope.

378
00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:45.970
hakan: And yeah on up for layers, or like on the layer 3, we would have the Exchange Protocols issue credential present proof

379
00:34:48.150 --> 00:34:52.319
that's a good point. I had forgotten later one which is also involved.

380
00:34:52.770 --> 00:34:56.009
Bruce Conrad: because in our project we're only using periods

381
00:34:56.790 --> 00:34:57.709
not using them.

382
00:34:57.840 --> 00:34:58.479
Ours

383
00:34:58.790 --> 00:34:59.609
hakan: right?

384
00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:05.439
Lance Byrd: Yeah.

385
00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:09.200
hakan: So.

386
00:35:09.560 --> 00:35:17.839
hakan: Lance, I I think my question would be: we are going to have a profile, and this profile is important. So once to

387
00:35:18.090 --> 00:35:24.889
hakan: agents are creating a co-establishing a connection using the V 2 like the yeah protocols.

388
00:35:25.490 --> 00:35:27.640
hakan: and they would be able to.

389
00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:32.090
hakan: So what exactly, what, what would that mean like? Is it?

390
00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:37.050
hakan: Does it mean that they can exchange a set of

391
00:35:37.190 --> 00:35:39.120
hakan: credentials.

392
00:35:39.510 --> 00:35:44.399
hakan: Does that mean that they can exchange messages like by a basic messaging?

393
00:35:44.450 --> 00:35:55.250
hakan: Or does it be something else? Because with the base requirements, what i'm having a bit of a problem is okay, let's say I. I support all that page requirements, but I don't support anything else.

394
00:35:55.790 --> 00:36:07.140
hakan: I won't be able to communicate. I won't be able to write messages. I won't be able to issue credentials because I don't support. For example, Jason L. D attachment, or I don't know what the third attachment was. So.

395
00:36:07.410 --> 00:36:14.340
hakan: just with the basic requirement, it doesn't mean that I can't even test whether I have a

396
00:36:15.290 --> 00:36:32.150
hakan: Well, maybe we could test with discovery, features discover features. But like I said I, you wouldn't be able to exchange any basic messaging, or you couldn't be able to do issue credentials or present proof because of that attachment formats. And I think.

397
00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:42.029
Rodolfo Miranda: Yeah. But but I think the touch me are on the option. That's right. And then I think you should pick one optional, at least the main, plus one of the option, I find another.

398
00:36:42.140 --> 00:36:45.229
Rodolfo Miranda: and that that has at least the same.

399
00:36:45.740 --> 00:36:58.920
hakan: Yeah. But what what do those optionals mean? That's the part that I don't get like, is it optional in terms of it can be nothing. It can be you. You have to choose at this one or, you, all of them

400
00:37:00.020 --> 00:37:06.209
Rodolfo Miranda: that that's that's true. Yeah, that need to mean more specified. They are

401
00:37:06.510 --> 00:37:12.179
Rodolfo Miranda: what what it means. But I I mean, from my point of view, I would say, okay, I got a

402
00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:14.310
Rodolfo Miranda: I built a nation that

403
00:37:14.430 --> 00:37:17.599
Rodolfo Miranda: has the base requirement. And

404
00:37:17.980 --> 00:37:20.759
Rodolfo Miranda: so let me pass at least all the tests that

405
00:37:21.560 --> 00:37:23.400
Rodolfo Miranda: that made that er

406
00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:29.650
Rodolfo Miranda: correct right. And maybe I need to find an accident that has

407
00:37:29.940 --> 00:37:38.620
Rodolfo Miranda: these same requirements, plus Jason a. D. And all those tests on a path. So i'm going to be confident that my Asian that I built

408
00:37:39.090 --> 00:37:42.809
Rodolfo Miranda: can communicate with with others in that specifics.

409
00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:44.529
hakan: Yeah.

410
00:37:44.780 --> 00:37:45.830
right.

411
00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:51.129
Rodolfo Miranda: But maybe maybe that that some can be in in the a IP protocol. We should

412
00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:52.870
Rodolfo Miranda: really state that right?

413
00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:56.359
Rodolfo Miranda: Make a huge part of our string. Okay, this is the way we think

414
00:37:57.160 --> 00:37:57.939
Rodolfo Miranda: this is

415
00:37:58.080 --> 00:37:58.970
Rodolfo Miranda: this, is it?

416
00:37:59.660 --> 00:38:00.430
Alex: Yeah.

417
00:38:01.030 --> 00:38:07.959
Alex: Yeah, I didn't think like. Personally, I don't think that agents should like determine what credential formats they use, because you try to

418
00:38:07.980 --> 00:38:14.560
Alex: figure out credential format to you as I can the actual walkie packs for? I was like, hey? I'm trying to issue you like a

419
00:38:14.630 --> 00:38:20.249
Alex: You'd like to be credential like, do you accept it? Then you can like, hey? I cannot support your deputy financials.

420
00:38:20.670 --> 00:38:21.479
Alex: Oh.

421
00:38:21.950 --> 00:38:28.949
Alex: I i'm not sure that you can like. Do that at the discovery level of the agent, because like maybe you can be like, hey? This agent supports just an all the credentials only.

422
00:38:30.130 --> 00:38:30.930
Alex: but

423
00:38:31.080 --> 00:38:36.669
Alex: yeah, like i'm seeing like a multi-format world where you're going to have to spoke all of them eventually.

424
00:38:37.300 --> 00:38:41.179
Alex: So yeah, I think it's going to be a matter like on how you want to go about

425
00:38:41.630 --> 00:38:46.839
Alex: telling people like, hey? I'm only supporting this, and then we're gonna to support other ones in the future.

426
00:38:48.450 --> 00:38:52.749
Bruce Conrad: That's that's a very interesting point. Alex, you use the word eventually.

427
00:38:53.030 --> 00:39:01.199
Bruce Conrad: because our our our methodology with picos is that when we can grab some students we have them do a small piece.

428
00:39:01.380 --> 00:39:04.359
and then next year we will build on top of it

429
00:39:04.410 --> 00:39:05.449
in some way.

430
00:39:05.830 --> 00:39:09.759
Bruce Conrad: I was also, intrigued by an analogy

431
00:39:09.890 --> 00:39:14.649
Bruce Conrad: you that will only be understood by the by, by people. In this call.

432
00:39:14.700 --> 00:39:16.680
Bruce Conrad: which is we. We were visited.

433
00:39:16.840 --> 00:39:20.189
Bruce Conrad: we we're using Zoom as a transport layer to communicate.

434
00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:22.670
Bruce Conrad: and we were visited by Demetri.

435
00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:25.839
Bruce Conrad: who was able to use English, which is

436
00:39:26.230 --> 00:39:28.920
the basic interrupt profile

437
00:39:29.050 --> 00:39:30.269
Bruce Conrad: for this meeting.

438
00:39:30.490 --> 00:39:36.809
Bruce Conrad: and we were able to have a brief interaction with him to discover that we had nothing further to do

439
00:39:37.340 --> 00:39:38.270
with each other.

440
00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:43.399
Bruce Conrad: and that to me that would be the base layer of aip. 3

441
00:39:43.520 --> 00:39:44.940
you can you can.

442
00:39:45.020 --> 00:39:48.530
Bruce Conrad: You can meet another agent on whatever transport

443
00:39:48.710 --> 00:39:57.919
Bruce Conrad: that you and they are. You can have a brief conversation, and you may realize that there is nothing further you can do without the agenda, and it's over.

444
00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:04.949
Bruce Conrad: or you may find, as as one of you said earlier, you may find that there is some

445
00:40:05.170 --> 00:40:06.709
some further things that

446
00:40:06.730 --> 00:40:07.629
you have in common.

447
00:40:07.670 --> 00:40:08.389
You both

448
00:40:08.450 --> 00:40:11.809
Bruce Conrad: you basic message, and you can chat.

449
00:40:12.180 --> 00:40:15.480
or maybe you both have one of the

450
00:40:15.660 --> 00:40:17.879
configurations for

451
00:40:18.760 --> 00:40:22.350
exchanging credentials in common, and then you can work together.

452
00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:28.979
Lance Byrd: Yeah, that's that's really good, Bruce.

453
00:40:29.720 --> 00:40:31.490
Lance Byrd: I I so

454
00:40:31.970 --> 00:40:35.990
Lance Byrd: it's just building on top of that, then would we say that?

455
00:40:36.110 --> 00:40:47.480
Lance Byrd: you know trust ping is not necessary, for instance. but discover features seems to be like this initial interop

456
00:40:48.100 --> 00:41:01.060
Lance Byrd: spot. And we've talked about you know, maybe even having something above that that. that that people can agree on just so that they can complete the discover features.

457
00:41:03.210 --> 00:41:07.439
Lance Byrd: you know transaction or or exchange.

458
00:41:07.900 --> 00:41:08.959
Lance Byrd: But

459
00:41:09.610 --> 00:41:20.760
Lance Byrd: assuming that you know the other things are taken care of, then do we agree that that maybe discover features is where we would want

460
00:41:21.210 --> 00:41:23.210
Lance Byrd: I did come

461
00:41:24.260 --> 00:41:29.330
Lance Byrd: Aries interrupt profile 3 compliant agent to start.

462
00:41:30.970 --> 00:41:42.870
Rodolfo Miranda: I I I I I I would, I would say the full stack it can be to us back. Yeah. Yeah. Why, if if you do this color feature, what trust me is more basic than that. So

463
00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:54.859
Lance Byrd: yeah, but if if you had 2 agents and and again we're talking about an like interrupt profile here. So I what I keep seeing what what I think is a reoccurring theme is that,

464
00:41:55.200 --> 00:42:05.150
Lance Byrd: you know. Let's take Bruce's group right. They're going out to you know. Let's get started with. Did come. And okay, we're going to do. Did come V 2, and then they have

465
00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:06.500
Lance Byrd: there.

466
00:42:07.910 --> 00:42:29.869
Lance Byrd: They They have their requirements right. They have the things that they're interested in. And and and you know I was. I I showed my bias this more today, basically saying like, shouldn't basic message be here because i'm thinking basic message is something that that you know is this base level thing. But it's not right. I think. I think we're base. We're saying that it Isn't.

467
00:42:30.180 --> 00:42:31.910
Lance Byrd: so

468
00:42:32.470 --> 00:42:36.750
Lance Byrd: if if we were going to have someone do, I did come

469
00:42:37.370 --> 00:42:40.470
Lance Byrd: a challenge or implementation

470
00:42:42.950 --> 00:42:47.990
Lance Byrd: or usage, I should say, and and it's going to be an aip. 3

471
00:42:51.580 --> 00:43:09.599
Lance Byrd: usage. Then I don't think that trust ping is something that you would. It's a nice place to start, you know it's. It's kind of a hello world, right? But it's it's not the thing that you need in order to be a IP 3 in order to be a IP 3. You kind of need to know.

472
00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:23.150
Lance Byrd: What what can you do? I I you know i'm here. What can I do? And what can you do but for for that you also need out of one right. You need to start the conversation. So you need out of one. And you need this color feature.

473
00:43:24.180 --> 00:43:27.990
Bruce Conrad: I I I agree. I think we're discovering the number 0.

474
00:43:28.740 --> 00:43:29.410
Okay.

475
00:43:29.620 --> 00:43:30.640
Lance Byrd: right?

476
00:43:30.940 --> 00:43:45.270
Lance Byrd: Yes. What what is right, the number 0 and a yeah, I would be fine with, saying that out of ban has to be supported, you know. so trust me, so so simple, that that put altogether this.

477
00:43:45.470 --> 00:43:56.239
Lance Byrd: No, I I agree that it is the but I again, if you wanted someone to do, you know. Be minimally aip 3. Do you need trust Bing? Trust things easy?

478
00:43:56.830 --> 00:44:04.229
Rodolfo Miranda: Yeah, Why not? It's something that we need to to define. That's you. Define what it is. Why, this color feature what it is it's got

479
00:44:04.700 --> 00:44:09.990
Lance Byrd: Well discover feature. Can Can you do

480
00:44:11.300 --> 00:44:14.940
Lance Byrd: you? You feel like we? You can do interrupt without discover features.

481
00:44:15.380 --> 00:44:22.840
Rodolfo Miranda: Yeah, of course. Yeah. And the message don't give a replace, and that's it. If I ask for the credentials, i'll get okay.

482
00:44:23.010 --> 00:44:25.969
Rodolfo Miranda: So that's why we're putting all together. So let's

483
00:44:26.030 --> 00:44:29.379
Rodolfo Miranda: minimum just being out of one. This got a feature

484
00:44:29.730 --> 00:44:31.579
Rodolfo Miranda: routing, if you need it. But

485
00:44:31.640 --> 00:44:33.579
if not, it's it's okay.

486
00:44:34.150 --> 00:44:36.060
Rodolfo Miranda: Yeah, the the

487
00:44:36.260 --> 00:44:41.739
Bruce Conrad: if if sorry, Rhoda, if if I come to the table saying, i'm a IP, 3,

488
00:44:41.770 --> 00:44:45.279
Bruce Conrad: and the other agent sends me to discover features request.

489
00:44:45.350 --> 00:44:48.170
Bruce Conrad: If I don't respond, then clearly

490
00:44:48.300 --> 00:44:50.550
we have nothing further to say to each other.

491
00:44:50.860 --> 00:44:52.010
which is fine.

492
00:44:53.560 --> 00:44:56.339
Bruce Conrad: But we interoperate at the 0 level.

493
00:44:56.750 --> 00:44:59.329
In other words, we can hear each other's messages.

494
00:45:00.550 --> 00:45:04.280
And and we can then determine that there is nothing further to do

495
00:45:05.710 --> 00:45:08.489
Lance Byrd: but that that does feel like

496
00:45:08.710 --> 00:45:10.220
Lance Byrd: you're doing did come.

497
00:45:10.600 --> 00:45:23.660
Lance Byrd: and that's not quite like, interrupt profile so how come You've got your hand up, and and how can I had said, like, you know what is the point of of a IP 3 i'm trying to.

498
00:45:24.820 --> 00:45:31.310
Lance Byrd: you know. Try to add different constraints on you guys, and see what they what the response is. in order to kind of

499
00:45:31.330 --> 00:45:32.680
Lance Byrd: it out like

500
00:45:32.720 --> 00:45:44.539
Lance Byrd: you know, we're not talking. Did come. V. 2 Here we're talking aip 3, which, you know, needs did come. So the question is like, what is that minimally look like.

501
00:45:44.550 --> 00:46:03.059
Lance Byrd: so that we don't put any extra burden on on an implementer. again, if they hook up, let's say their agent to the Aries agent test harness, and you, you know, literally have a tag in there that, says Aip 3 which means run, run. These tests Run my agent against these tests that are aip 3.

502
00:46:03.280 --> 00:46:05.120
Lance Byrd: I would love

503
00:46:06.280 --> 00:46:17.050
Lance Byrd: that to be like, hey? You achieved, we'll say, level 0 of a IP 3. But the question is, what is that? You know what what belongs in there, so that's kind of the way I look at it. Hack on.

504
00:46:17.150 --> 00:46:17.830
Yeah.

505
00:46:19.820 --> 00:46:22.310
hakan: I think I agree with you. And also

506
00:46:22.720 --> 00:46:31.999
hakan: according to these base requirements, we could actually detach the issue, credential and present proof from from the base requirement itself. Because

507
00:46:32.340 --> 00:46:33.840
hakan: if you look into

508
00:46:33.980 --> 00:46:39.730
hakan: the other requirements that are here expect, except the revocation notification. Now.

509
00:46:39.840 --> 00:46:58.630
hakan: it's. It's all related to Dcom, so that you can actually establish a connection. Using did come by out of bands, or trust being is a part of the did come back to discover features that the part of the discom spec routing is a a future of the did come spec. So

510
00:46:58.640 --> 00:47:11.400
hakan: if you want to do the discomfort to if you want aip 3 point or based on this convey to, then we would need to support. These protocols that are

511
00:47:11.440 --> 00:47:16.269
hakan: written within the spec of did come according to the Diff. So that's why.

512
00:47:16.460 --> 00:47:30.149
hakan: I think we should have all trust being out of band discovery, features routing. that is something that I don't think we should dispute, because it's already the spec. And if you want to dispute it, and I think we should bring it out to the diff working group.

513
00:47:32.070 --> 00:47:41.890
hakan: And also, yeah, my second point would be if we once, then we could take the exchange protocols out of the base requirements and put it into credential exchange area.

514
00:47:46.080 --> 00:47:54.209
Rodolfo Miranda: Yeah. So I support it. Yeah, because it's we we can write it a. I. P. 3 in a different way as the other, and and say exactly what what it means.

515
00:47:54.350 --> 00:47:56.769
Rodolfo Miranda: little serial, or whatever we want to call it.

516
00:47:56.950 --> 00:47:58.660
Rodolfo Miranda: It's just it. The company, too.

517
00:47:58.840 --> 00:48:02.909
Rodolfo Miranda: We did it peers. And then the others. Yeah, like

518
00:48:11.110 --> 00:48:22.609
Lance Byrd: yeah, other thoughts, I mean, I I, I are people warming up to this idea of the a IP 3 having kind of a level 0, and maybe even all

519
00:48:23.730 --> 00:48:39.549
Lance Byrd: maybe we have other tracks that are like we'll say, like credential exchange level one or something like that, like a way of of again guiding somebody towards like. Here is our minimal common paths that will help you to

520
00:48:39.560 --> 00:48:44.650
Lance Byrd: hopefully interrupt with someone else. for the the use case and the requirements that you have.

521
00:48:46.360 --> 00:48:50.269
Alex: Yeah to me Level 0 sounds like the date can be 2 spec

522
00:48:50.740 --> 00:48:58.539
Alex: in terms of like the features they like. I'm hearing about it's like, hey? Like you, they implemented the company to spec, or I can like you don't

523
00:48:58.790 --> 00:49:09.679
Alex: And then yeah, it's like, I feel like that. we can already have that like with the peer libraries, and we can do some like you can kind of like spin up with some minimal

524
00:49:09.770 --> 00:49:14.539
Alex: scripts in Python right with the the sick by libraries we did here, so you can have like that

525
00:49:14.960 --> 00:49:17.579
Alex: demo like interoperability.

526
00:49:17.890 --> 00:49:21.839
Alex: But once you really start to do like anything that's not Demo like

527
00:49:21.950 --> 00:49:32.030
Alex: It's going to get challenging to figure out exactly the credential format, the signature types making sure like everything works right like all the models are mapped properly.

528
00:49:32.280 --> 00:49:44.530
Alex: That's when I kind of give you becomes like more dice. I think that we already have that level 0 interoperability level where we can talk between different like transport layers, since that's defined today. From which respect in and of itself.

529
00:49:44.550 --> 00:49:46.189
Alex: it's transport agnostic.

530
00:49:46.320 --> 00:49:57.779
Alex: yeah, that's kinda like I agree with. I can as well from from that perspective in terms of like, we should implement at least minimally, everything that's implemented in the spec.

531
00:49:59.930 --> 00:50:00.839
Lance Byrd: Okay.

532
00:50:00.920 --> 00:50:03.299
Lance Byrd: now is that

533
00:50:04.900 --> 00:50:11.559
Lance Byrd: in reality is that is that what's in the sick? The libraries right now, for instance.

534
00:50:12.080 --> 00:50:19.210
Alex: Yeah. Cause I, the problem that we had with Jf. Is that Snore and Brian they use the did web, so had they used it here.

535
00:50:19.230 --> 00:50:20.640
Alex: it would have been like

536
00:50:20.990 --> 00:50:22.040
Alex: agrees.

537
00:50:22.160 --> 00:50:25.690
Alex: So that was the only issue there. It was like a

538
00:50:26.110 --> 00:50:35.410
Alex: problem like he wasn't like the the messages themselves were like too complicated, or what not. The reason why we had to break down the messages is because we didn't have enough time, and

539
00:50:35.470 --> 00:50:38.849
Alex: the encryption wasn't working so like we tried to like, reduce

540
00:50:39.180 --> 00:50:47.990
Alex: the message exchange. So we're gonna have to implement all the underlying cryptography since it wasn't working in the first place. But had we had all of the low-level stuff implemented like

541
00:50:48.240 --> 00:50:53.150
Alex: writing Walkie taxes in exchange. It wouldn't be that big of an issue, because

542
00:50:53.380 --> 00:51:02.330
Alex: if you just support Jwt: all you have to implement is like those Jose Library and most developers are like familiar with Jwts and whatnot

543
00:51:03.770 --> 00:51:06.270
Alex: rather than Jason it'll be for

544
00:51:06.440 --> 00:51:08.009
Alex: and on Prads or

545
00:51:08.840 --> 00:51:12.500
Alex: the Iso Mdl. Spec. That eventually is going to be and what not.

546
00:51:15.550 --> 00:51:16.399
Lance Byrd: Okay.

547
00:51:19.050 --> 00:51:25.930
Lance Byrd: So shall I comment then, on on pulling these out into as optional.

548
00:51:26.500 --> 00:51:33.139
Lance Byrd: Is that is everybody okay, with that for Wacky packs for for issue, credential and present proof.

549
00:51:37.760 --> 00:51:41.519
Rodolfo Miranda: And I think we're location right? Because we location is to the

550
00:51:43.480 --> 00:51:46.020
Lance Byrd: Okay. So all 3 of these

551
00:51:46.850 --> 00:51:49.100
Lance Byrd: suggesting

552
00:51:58.660 --> 00:52:05.339
Lance Byrd: Is everybody okay with me, putting the comment that the Aries did company to working group

553
00:52:07.500 --> 00:52:09.520
Lance Byrd: would like to consider

554
00:52:11.730 --> 00:52:14.930
Lance Byrd: only

555
00:52:16.490 --> 00:52:19.260
Lance Byrd: revocation, notification

556
00:52:22.180 --> 00:52:24.650
Lance Byrd: issue credential

557
00:52:25.660 --> 00:52:27.560
Lance Byrd: and present proof

558
00:52:28.440 --> 00:52:30.129
Lance Byrd: into

559
00:52:30.920 --> 00:52:32.620
Lance Byrd: an optional section.

560
00:52:34.210 --> 00:52:40.169
Alex: I guess just to be able to advocate aren't. We just then implementing the dipcombe to spec.

561
00:52:40.210 --> 00:52:42.240
Alex: If you don't have like the issue credential

562
00:52:42.820 --> 00:52:43.629
Alex: in there.

563
00:52:44.450 --> 00:52:51.140
Lance Byrd: Well, I think that the at least one difference would be specifying the peer did

564
00:52:53.300 --> 00:53:01.869
Lance Byrd: and and and that at least shows like if we were again to to put it in in terms of the trust over IP stack

565
00:53:03.570 --> 00:53:13.420
Lance Byrd: That would show layer one. You know what is. You know it's nice to have super simple layer. One you know. Go, Pier did right layer. 2

566
00:53:13.720 --> 00:53:17.199
Lance Byrd: did come v 2 implementation, right?

567
00:53:17.350 --> 00:53:27.639
Lance Byrd: and then essentially, we're saying layer 3 stuff is all these optional things that maybe we have, you know, documentation that says.

568
00:53:27.930 --> 00:53:35.040
Lance Byrd: okay, these things are optional. But you know, here's Here's a common path for issuing credentials, or you know, whatever it might be.

569
00:53:36.130 --> 00:53:44.029
Lance Byrd: so on that I mean, it seems like very little, but it sounds like Alex. For Jf. For instance, you know

570
00:53:44.050 --> 00:53:50.429
Lance Byrd: it would be what you guys would have been way more successful if if that had been, you know, specified that way. Possibly.

571
00:53:51.230 --> 00:53:56.690
Alex: Yeah, yeah, definitely. I think it would have been helpful if we can. Just I've agreed on like using the tiers.

572
00:53:56.760 --> 00:54:01.750
Alex: yeah, but we didn't know that the libraries support for adding, you did methods for

573
00:54:01.820 --> 00:54:03.589
Alex: that one key.

574
00:54:03.790 --> 00:54:20.589
Lance Byrd: Yeah, yeah. And that's yeah, that's what we want people to kind of understand is, you know. Okay, maybe this this may seem trivial to you, but you know, trust us, it's not right or something like that. and there's probably something else that we're not quite thinking about

575
00:54:20.600 --> 00:54:32.459
Lance Byrd: yet. That might also go in kind of this minimal you know, layer one layer 2. There might be something in there that we're not thinking of, although I wouldn't know you guys, you would know better. So

576
00:54:35.180 --> 00:54:38.639
Bruce Conrad: i'm! I'm your point lunch. You could soften the blow by

577
00:54:38.810 --> 00:54:45.260
Lance Byrd: by saying into a recommended optional section or something like that.

578
00:54:47.870 --> 00:54:51.770
Bruce Conrad: Then that that's an odd to the fact that it that it had been in the base

579
00:54:53.480 --> 00:54:54.470
Lance Byrd: right.

580
00:54:54.650 --> 00:54:56.480
as someone said earlier.

581
00:54:57.440 --> 00:55:03.489
Bruce Conrad: think it was Alex and heck we eventually we would want to support, not just

582
00:55:04.150 --> 00:55:07.930
the the Walkie Pax way of doing credentials, but also at least one of the

583
00:55:08.050 --> 00:55:08.830
others, I mean.

584
00:55:08.900 --> 00:55:10.060
perhaps all of them

585
00:55:10.420 --> 00:55:11.290
eventually.

586
00:55:12.250 --> 00:55:13.690
But you work your way up.

587
00:55:14.170 --> 00:55:14.959
Lance Byrd: Yeah.

588
00:55:15.610 --> 00:55:17.009
Lance Byrd: and and yeah.

589
00:55:18.140 --> 00:55:19.219
Lance Byrd: sorry. Go ahead.

590
00:55:19.700 --> 00:55:20.519
I was done.

591
00:55:20.720 --> 00:55:48.290
Lance Byrd: Okay, yeah, and right and this, so that might also be our opportunity to say, okay, here's this thing called Wackypex Light, or or like it did come, you know, minimal, or you know, basically saying, okay, this is inspired by Wacky did come. if you implement this your your you know we'll say we'll pretend it's 33% of the way there for for Wacky did come. But you can start interoping with other people who have implemented. you know Wacky did come. Simple.

592
00:55:48.840 --> 00:55:52.800
Lance Byrd: Does that seem reasonable, Alex, based on your

593
00:55:52.890 --> 00:55:57.959
Lance Byrd: experience and and or yeah, and anybody else thoughts

594
00:55:58.030 --> 00:56:00.220
Lance Byrd: we've got 4 min.

595
00:56:00.750 --> 00:56:01.729
Lance Byrd: 3 min.

596
00:56:05.230 --> 00:56:05.850
Alex: Hmm.

597
00:56:07.280 --> 00:56:10.539
Alex: I'm trying to think. Sorry, I guess. Like what i'm trying.

598
00:56:10.590 --> 00:56:12.649
Alex: I'm not sure that.

599
00:56:14.610 --> 00:56:20.500
Alex: So like the problem is, it's not like the the walkypex itself, like just to find, like the messages they need to be sent back and forth.

600
00:56:20.600 --> 00:56:29.260
Alex: and like that's not hard in and of itself right like you. Just it's some header. So you got to put on in different messages. The hard thing is like doing that, like supporting the actual decryption.

601
00:56:29.690 --> 00:56:34.390
Alex: and, like the do you support credentials, definitions, credentials, presentations.

602
00:56:34.420 --> 00:56:47.490
Alex: this for just an ld like it just an early processor. Those are like the other things it's not necessarily like. I don't think that what you packs like, whether like you asked for getting a credential first or not?

603
00:56:47.500 --> 00:57:00.790
Alex: Is that challenging is actually like doing the validations like? Do you need to do that or all that kind of stuff, because, like you can always omit it, and the walkie packs like some steps are optional already in there, so like you don't have to request a credential. You can just like.

604
00:57:00.900 --> 00:57:03.339
Alex: hey, like, propose a request.

605
00:57:03.970 --> 00:57:14.770
Alex: and then like, accept the request, and then, like you can issue a credential, and then it to sub differential. So I think it's relatively minimal already, in the sense that it doesn't define all to like. Send multiple credentials at once.

606
00:57:14.930 --> 00:57:16.489
Alex: or that kind of stuff.

607
00:57:16.630 --> 00:57:17.640
Alex: Yeah.

608
00:57:18.140 --> 00:57:28.429
Alex: yes, like I'm not sure like breaking that down, even like the Walkie packs like even further, because then all you would just do is just like issue, a credential. And that would be it.

609
00:57:28.550 --> 00:57:32.810
Alex: in my opinion. Because, yeah, like the credential manifest, is already optional

610
00:57:33.010 --> 00:57:34.270
Alex: in Walkiepex.

611
00:57:35.590 --> 00:57:39.410
Lance Byrd: tell me something. So

612
00:57:40.410 --> 00:57:41.850
Lance Byrd: if you

613
00:57:42.060 --> 00:57:46.750
Lance Byrd: when when I if you do discover features.

614
00:57:47.180 --> 00:57:49.360
Lance Byrd: does it tell you.

615
00:57:49.750 --> 00:57:54.120
Lance Byrd: hey? okay, I support Wacky pecks.

616
00:57:54.280 --> 00:57:58.290
Lance Byrd: But I didn't implement these optional pieces.

617
00:57:59.700 --> 00:58:06.259
Lance Byrd: I'm going to assume it's not we, traditionally Hasn't been that expressive. Not that you couldn't do it.

618
00:58:06.270 --> 00:58:23.690
Lance Byrd: do it using discover features. But you you get what I'm getting at right, that that again this discoverability. Okay, If there is a bunch of parts that are optional. how do I know if if you did it or not, do I just start. We just try, and then we break, or you know it would be nice to, you know, be able to discover ahead of time.

619
00:58:25.860 --> 00:58:26.819
Alex: Oh.

620
00:58:27.750 --> 00:58:32.219
Alex: I guess you'd be nice to discover I have time to do

621
00:58:32.490 --> 00:58:51.739
Alex: like. What's the use? Case, I guess, like i'm trying to figure out. Hey? You like request a credential, but, like you, don't support me asking for credential like, what's that? Well, I was, I was thinking, more like so. You had mentioned like credential formats, for instance. What if what if you wanted to say something like, hey, My preferences that you give me a credential in Json, Ld.

622
00:58:52.030 --> 00:59:00.669
Alex: But so you do that. You do that whenever somebody like in the Walkypex protocol. That's when you do that? It's like, hey? I'm trying to send you a Gwd.

623
00:59:01.060 --> 00:59:08.420
Alex: Do you want to accept it? And then you can say yes, I want to accept it, and then, like. The next message is like somebody that's issued a differential

624
00:59:08.450 --> 00:59:13.939
Alex: with the data that they send you in the proposed, and then you can accept that, or you can decline the proposal

625
00:59:14.170 --> 00:59:17.360
Alex: so like that's when you would do that.

626
00:59:17.460 --> 00:59:18.729
Lance Byrd: Yeah.

627
00:59:18.880 --> 00:59:22.520
Alex: it's like, hey? These are like, what proof types do you support.

628
00:59:22.610 --> 00:59:25.660
Alex: What trans will do you support? I am proposing this.

629
00:59:25.740 --> 00:59:33.609
Alex: Oh, do you want to accept it or not? So that's already done at the Walkypex level like that's get negotiated in in there. Yeah.

630
00:59:33.770 --> 00:59:34.529
Lance Byrd: Okay.

631
00:59:35.120 --> 00:59:36.300
Lance Byrd: yeah. I got you.

632
00:59:37.840 --> 00:59:41.180
Lance Byrd: Okay, Any last parting thoughts, because that's our time

633
00:59:43.240 --> 00:59:46.499
Lance Byrd: to. Is everybody feel all right with the direction we're heading.

634
00:59:46.810 --> 00:59:53.639
hakan: Yeah, maybe one thing that I would like to add or ask to the Aries community, because I mean most of

635
00:59:53.810 --> 00:59:56.769
hakan: the people participating in here is.

636
00:59:56.830 --> 01:00:01.350
hakan: if I understand, correct, not using as framework as as a

637
01:00:01.850 --> 01:00:03.310
hakan: underlying

638
01:00:03.630 --> 01:00:15.970
hakan: yeah framework. Let's say, I would like to ask this as well to the Aries community who are who worked on the aip one and 2 point. Oh, to get like a bit of

639
01:00:16.300 --> 01:00:20.719
hakan: background information about. What was the perspective that they were taking on

640
01:00:21.560 --> 01:00:35.450
hakan: like? Was it the perspective of credential issuance was the perspective of fulfilling the interactions that are happening between issue hold the verifier, or was it more general and depending on it? I think we will have a better direction of like having the areas into a profile, 3:

641
01:00:36.300 --> 01:00:37.650
Lance Byrd: yeah, good point

642
01:00:38.370 --> 01:00:57.210
Lance Byrd: A. And and learn from that perspective. But then, I think, bringing this new perspective of hey, this is a group of people who are who I actually have to deal with did comfy, too, right? And and and you know, maybe the perspective has has shifted. Now, you know. Obviously, Bruce is okay. Yeah, I think that's perfect.

643
01:00:57.220 --> 01:01:11.600
Lance Byrd: Okay? Well, I think there is a meeting the user group meetings later today, for for if and so that could be an opportunity. And then Aries working group has been covering aip as well, I think, on Wednesday. So that's been really good with Sam. So

644
01:01:11.610 --> 01:01:19.560
hakan: okay, you send me that link. Please lens the the world for the Aries one. I'm not aware of that one. Thank you.

645
01:01:19.700 --> 01:01:24.919
Lance Byrd: I will do that right now, other than that, any other parting thoughts

646
01:01:25.690 --> 01:01:26.310
and

647
01:01:27.120 --> 01:01:28.849
Bruce Conrad: happy holidays for everyone.

648
01:01:28.950 --> 01:01:34.580
Rodolfo Miranda: Yeah.

649
01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:40.540
Lance Byrd: that's right. They'll be celebrating for 4 years. Now.

650
01:01:42.560 --> 01:01:53.979
Lance Byrd: Yeah, it's good. okay, the Yup, the link to the latest areas Working group people are, are, you know, obviously free to jump off. But I just wanted to get that into the chat.

651
01:01:54.700 --> 01:01:56.379
Lance Byrd: Very good, great to see you all.

652
01:01:57.270 --> 01:02:00.479
Lance Byrd: we get together in the New Year. Yeah.

653
01:02:00.560 --> 01:02:04.779
hakan: good bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye.
