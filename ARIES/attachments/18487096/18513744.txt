12:19:21	 From  Daniel Hardman : re-paste of link to what I’m going to discuss re. machine-readable governance frameworks: https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/concepts/0430-machine-readable-governance-frameworks/README.md
12:29:53	 From  Ajay Jadhav : Will some one please share the link to the doc again? 
12:30:16	 From  Dev Bharel : https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/concepts/0430-machine-readable-governance-frameworks/README.md
12:30:27	 From  Ajay Jadhav : Thanks
12:41:23	 From  Nathan George : I really want to conflate this with the lock icon in TLS/SSL, it seems very helpful as a tool but there are also dangers it could be taken too far.  Do you have any commentary about that?
12:47:27	 From  John Jordan : Are we interested in any discussion on how these kinds of topics / RFCs might be quite well homed in the Trust over IP working groups? Or are we thinking this is Aries based?
12:51:19	 From  Nathan George : It still scares me
12:51:44	 From  Nathan George : But I think a couple of “I’m a bad guy what would I try” sessions will help
12:52:29	 From  Nathan George : “I’m a good guy where can I turn”
12:52:44	 From  Andrew Whitehead : I’m a good guy why won’t you *trust* me?
12:53:10	 From  Nathan George : You are sharing this data according to TECHINICAL-stuff-i-dont-understand-7.3 <Cancel> or <Allow>
12:53:57	 From  Nathan George : We need these tools to do a good job.  We _could_ also use them to do a bad job.  Either way I think we still want this type of tool
12:54:20	 From  Stephen Curran : +1
12:54:28	 From  Ajay Jadhav : Agree with John..
