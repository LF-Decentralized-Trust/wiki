00:22:46	Daniel Hardman:	re-paste of link to what I’m going to discuss re. machine-readable governance frameworks: https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/concepts/0430-machine-readable-governance-frameworks/README.md
00:33:18	Ajay Jadhav:	Will some one please share the link to the doc again? 
00:33:41	Dev Bharel:	https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/concepts/0430-machine-readable-governance-frameworks/README.md
00:33:52	Ajay Jadhav:	Thanks
00:44:47	Nathan George:	I really want to conflate this with the lock icon in TLS/SSL, it seems very helpful as a tool but there are also dangers it could be taken too far.  Do you have any commentary about that?
00:50:51	John Jordan:	Are we interested in any discussion on how these kinds of topics / RFCs might be quite well homed in the Trust over IP working groups? Or are we thinking this is Aries based?
00:54:44	Nathan George:	It still scares me
00:55:09	Nathan George:	But I think a couple of “I’m a bad guy what would I try” sessions will help
00:55:53	Nathan George:	“I’m a good guy where can I turn”
00:56:09	Andrew Whitehead:	I’m a good guy why won’t you *trust* me?
00:56:35	Nathan George:	You are sharing this data according to TECHINICAL-stuff-i-dont-understand-7.3 <Cancel> or <Allow>
00:57:22	Nathan George:	We need these tools to do a good job.  We _could_ also use them to do a bad job.  Either way I think we still want this type of tool
00:57:45	Stephen Curran:	+1
00:57:52	Ajay Jadhav:	Agree with John..
