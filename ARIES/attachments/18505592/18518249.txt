00:36:47	Gianluca Capuzzi:	Sorry I'm Gianluca I am a mentee of Hyperledger Mentorship Program and I belong to Standard Documentation Task Force: could I ask you if you need help for writing documentation? I'll report back to my team.
00:43:11	Lohan Spies:	We are using Helm charts for our infra
00:44:18	Akiff Manji:	Iâ€™ve been adding them to repos that I contribute to
00:44:28	Akiff Manji:	I think theyâ€™re useful
00:48:50	Emiliano SuÃ±Ã©:	We are using Helm charts for our infraWe'll be happy to get feedback/suggestions once we open the PR with the initial cut - it shouldn't be too long until it is ready. Hoping this will be the way to go to deploy ACA-Py and add it as a dependency for other services/deployments ðŸ™‚
00:49:30	Lohan Spies:	Is there a PR or a branch that we can monitor or follow?
00:49:40	Lohan Spies:	Or alert us when you create the PR?
00:50:03	Emiliano SuÃ±Ã©:	Not yet, but I'll make sure to mention it in the ACA-Pug meeting as soon as there is one
00:50:11	Lohan Spies:	Would be great to contribute where we can. At the moment we donâ€™t support all env parameters, just the those that we require
00:51:32	Emiliano SuÃ±Ã©:	We're kind-of starting in a similar way and making sure the ones we use are supported, but are trying to come up with a standard way to use them - possibly with the configuration file and reasonable defaults rather than envvars
00:52:17	Lohan Spies:	Great. Let me know how we can review / contribute
00:55:50	Charles Lanahan:	haha the horror
00:55:56	Lohan Spies:	Good luck Stephen!
