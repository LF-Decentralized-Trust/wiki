00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:42.499
Lance Byrd: I can. How are you? Very good. How are you doing good?

2
00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:50.809
Hakan: Let's see if I can take host here. Can I give you a host. No, i'm not host,

3
00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.050
Lance Byrd: and I also guessed right.

4
00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:57.069
Lance Byrd: Let's see here,

5
00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:08.699
Lance Byrd: Alex, how are you?

6
00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:09.589
Lance Byrd: Huh?

7
00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:12.520
Lance Byrd: Good.

8
00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:20.510
Alex: Good. I'm. Still trying to figure out the did come back Native library. Maybe we can try to do some building today. Hey, guys!

9
00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.490
Hakan: Hi! Oh,

10
00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.830
Judith Högerl: hey, Judas!

11
00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:30.259
Lance Byrd: Hmm.

12
00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.830
Lance Byrd: Usually I can

13
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:43.889
Lance Byrd: go to a participants click on my own name and take Oh, here we go claim host. They've just changed it a little bit. That's all

14
00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.679
Lance Byrd: sweet, I think I am. I'm host now

15
00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.669
Lance Byrd: unlimited power. Okay,

16
00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.120
Lance Byrd: um. And it looks like we're already recording. So that's great, too.

17
00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:00.730
Lance Byrd: Hey? Rhoda?

18
00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:10.050
Lance Byrd: Okay,

19
00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:18.619
Lance Byrd: Judith, do you? Uh? So last uh meeting we had hack on, and Alex and Rhoda and myself. Do you want to? Uh,

20
00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:21.860
Judith Högerl: introduce yourself, and maybe let us.

21
00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:36.369
Judith Högerl: Um, yeah, I'm writing my master thesis in the area of software and identity and the ideas to implement it can be two for Acupay And I can. It's actually my supervisor.

22
00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:45.240
Lance Byrd: Yeah, Great to have you? Are you on um discord with us? Just okay and um

23
00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.250
let me

24
00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.559
Lance Byrd: do. I know your discord handle?

25
00:02:53.440 --> 00:03:00.349
Lance Byrd: Do you know what it is? Maybe I've seen you on there, or have you posted there? Okay, Yeah, no worries

26
00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:04.350
Lance Byrd: no worries, Baron. How are you?

27
00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:09.709
Lance Byrd: I called him out.

28
00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.290
Lance Byrd: No worries. Maybe he's not ready,

29
00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:18.129
Judith Högerl: or he just muted there, maybe trying. Okay, No worries.

30
00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:19.620
Lance Byrd: Take your time.

31
00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:22.330
Lance Byrd: Cool.

32
00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:28.429
Lance Byrd: Okay, and let's see. I'll bring up our page as well for today

33
00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:34.439
Lance Byrd: and hold on. Let me publish it so I can post the link to you guys.

34
00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.910
Lance Byrd: Okay, that

35
00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:48.090
Lance Byrd: that's our link for today, and I can share my screen.

36
00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:51.280
Lance Byrd: Sure

37
00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:56.250
uh on.

38
00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:00.220
Lance Byrd: Okay,

39
00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:07.670
Lance Byrd: don't Judge uh all. My tabs probably should have closed those before this. But that's all right.

40
00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:16.029
Lance Byrd: Okay. So feel uh so welcome to the area State Com. V. Two working group uh for November twenty eighth, the two thousand and twenty-two

41
00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:32.439
Lance Byrd: happy to See everybody here. Um, we are now on zoom. So you guys have made it here. I guess i'll double check. Make sure no one's asking because we met on Google meet last time, just because I didn't know if they were going to get everything set up. But they did. Aries is great great community.

42
00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:38.220
Lance Byrd: Please feel free to add yourself to the attendees list for today, if you like.

43
00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:56.539
Lance Byrd: Um, we just have to remember the uh antitrust policy for Hyper Ledger. Um also the code of conduct for Hyper Ledger, which maybe I don't have a link to. But um! You should be able to find it on confluence um, and maybe i'll link to it on our future meetings.

44
00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:02.730
Lance Byrd: And essentially, yeah, this group. Um, This is our second meeting.

45
00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:30.360
Lance Byrd: I think our second meeting, maybe third uh and uh, our goal is to um see, did convey to adoption within Aries uh accelerating um. So for some that is a a focus on did come V. One transitioning to did Company two, and then for others. That is just adding a didcom uh implementation to their Aries agent, or let's say, a mediator or

46
00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:31.530
Lance Byrd: um,

47
00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:39.160
Lance Byrd: Yeah, some component within the area's ecosystem. So we think, if did come V. Two can be successful here.

48
00:05:39.170 --> 00:06:03.869
Lance Byrd: Uh, then, you know it can be successful out outside of here. Uh, you know, roots Id which I'm associated with, for instance, has customers outside of Aries That, uh are are very interested in did come be, too. Uh, but then they're also very aware of ares, and they want to interrupt with Aries agents uh So if we can all get did comfy to going uh within the area's ecosystem. Then we we think adoption outside will

49
00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:21.789
Lance Byrd: will be rapid and uh well satisfying for us. So let's go through any uh well welcomes. Uh. So Judith introduced herself. That's great. Um, Baron. Most of us already know. If he

50
00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:40.380
Berend Sliedrecht: wants to say anything, go for it, Baron, but no pressure. Uh Oh, yeah, it works awesome. Um. So I'm: i'm a business I mainly work on uh Aj as a maintainer, and I've also been working on my own to go through a library in pure typescripts.

51
00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:46.730
Berend Sliedrecht: Uh: So that's also basically why I joined. Because I thought maybe there were some questions or something uh that I can help with.

52
00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:59.439
Hakan: Yeah, that's great. Where are you joining from? By the way, parents, from which company which uh continents?

53
00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:18.910
Lance Byrd: Yeah, very good. Uh, yeah, Baron right? He has his implementation that he's been building up uh in typescript, I think. Alex. Uh from roots. Ids also looking at that. Um, but you can correct me if i'm wrong, Alex. And then

54
00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:26.870
Alex: yeah, I am. And I do. I have a couple of questions actually, like I was trying to implement it on our wallet and some of the imports with the native libraries We're failing.

55
00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:27.880
Alex: Uh:

56
00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:36.019
Alex: so. Yeah, but yeah, I've been playing around with your library as well as the the sick. But um react native

57
00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:37.340
Alex: in the past, like

58
00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:40.159
Alex: week. Pretty much. So yeah, thank you for coming.

59
00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:51.710
Lance Byrd: Yeah, that's super exciting. Uh: so Yeah, we'll cover that for sure today. Let me put that on our discussion topics. Uh:

60
00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:54.610
Lance Byrd: yeah, uh typescript

61
00:07:55.210 --> 00:07:57.630
Lance Byrd: Uh: implementation.

62
00:07:57.890 --> 00:08:00.580
Lance Byrd: Talk about that. Um:

63
00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:03.290
Lance Byrd: Okay? And I also see snow on the

64
00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:20.649
Lance Byrd: on the call. If if you want to say anything snore, you know, go for it. Um! He he's. If I can do a quick introduction just from my point of view, Him and Alex did a bunch of work on the Jff challenge leading up to Iw. Which we all just attended, or a bunch of us just attended.

65
00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:35.500
Lance Byrd: Uh. That was really cool, and I've gotten to sit in some of the meetings with uh with them, and just see uh them working through some of the interop issues for for did company, too. And uh, that's been really useful. Um,

66
00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:45.729
Lance Byrd: just watching, you know, separate teams, basically all the collaboration that they have to do. Yeah, I admittedly, it's more than maybe um.

67
00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:56.030
Lance Byrd: We'd like, you know, a team to have to do. But, uh, you know what these are, the growing pains of this, And And so in a lot of ways their efforts. Um have been. Uh,

68
00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:01.749
Lance Byrd: have driven the the creation of this group and this meeting,

69
00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:17.649
Lance Byrd: so that we can kind of capture some of these elements to help people to um be able to navigate the did Company to implementations and some of the pain points. And you know, finding the quickest path basically. So that's good stuff. You want to say anything, Schnor.

70
00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:23.939
Snorre Edwin: I think you covered most of it. Uh But yeah, i'm from

71
00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:33.619
Snorre Edwin: uh, we're using good comedy to self-made uh. So we had to adopt secret library for primarily

72
00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:38.549
Snorre Edwin: encryption decryption. Um: And um, yeah,

73
00:09:38.650 --> 00:09:43.390
Snorre Edwin: that's where we at. So I just wanted to jump in and see what's going on over here.

74
00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:58.730
Lance Byrd: Yeah, that's that's great. I'm just trying to pull up our um. The spreadsheet that I've been doing. That's a a bit of a didcom uh yeah aries Sitcom V: Two support. Yeah, go ahead.

75
00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:09.759
Hakan: It's been quick. Quick Question. Um, You are not using an Aries framework, but you are using Didcom. If I understood you correctly. And your software um solution.

76
00:10:09.970 --> 00:10:26.219
Hakan: That's true. Okay, cool. No, that's That's also super interesting. So yeah, uh it's gonna be an interesting conversation to see how we can connect these two words because this was one of the topics that we were talking about last week. Um! Due to the fact that uh ares

77
00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:40.599
Hakan: as a Uh framework is all using uh connections as a concept. And um, there came to question or like, uh, yeah, a question mark basically how how we can make sure that uh,

78
00:10:40.610 --> 00:10:52.519
Hakan: we can create like Aries. Uh sorry it did convey to uh communication relationship whatever you want to call it, with an Aries agent and a uh non aerial space software.

79
00:10:53.420 --> 00:11:00.770
Snorre Edwin: Oh, yeah, also we that's we. We're not done with the jff yet, but that's where we do. See,

80
00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:03.949
Snorre Edwin: we had to break off very early.

81
00:11:04.290 --> 00:11:06.180
Snorre Edwin: Um!

82
00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:18.349
Snorre Edwin: Because the three people who did not use Aries um, or the the people who did the right use areas, did not. We're not comfortable enough in trying to adjust what's needed to be adjusted to meet

83
00:11:19.090 --> 00:11:26.019
Snorre Edwin: meet each other. So the we have to kind of separate each other between two groups. Um:

84
00:11:26.850 --> 00:11:30.369
Snorre Edwin: So yeah, it's a It's a tricky one,

85
00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:33.599
Hakan: you know.

86
00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:38.149
Lance Byrd: Yeah. Great. So um uh

87
00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:54.379
Lance Byrd: to to just kind of show how i'm trying to uh connect some of these dots. Uh if I go to the references section here. Um, I put the jff did come v two notes uh in here. And uh, if I bring those up

88
00:11:54.960 --> 00:12:00.200
Lance Byrd: hopefully, you guys are okay with me, sharing this uh with the group.

89
00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:11.620
Lance Byrd: Um, It is just really interesting uh to kind of walk through the kind of questions Uh and um

90
00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:20.160
Lance Byrd: uh the information that's been uh captured here in terms of uh, what parts of Didcom

91
00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:28.839
Lance Byrd: uh are important, you know. Where? Where, uh, do we find conflicts or or uh difficulty? Um,

92
00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:33.250
Lance Byrd: things like that? So I thought this document was really uh helpful.

93
00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:45.659
Lance Byrd: Um, I guess I should be so recording hosting links to these things. Let me do. Let me do my job. Uh, let's see here

94
00:12:45.970 --> 00:13:01.390
Lance Byrd: Now my interface is changed because i'm sharing. And so then I go back to the Chat Yo Here we go. So this is the survey uh document which has a link to the Jf. Ah, in the references Section

95
00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:21.810
Lance Byrd: Um. And And yeah. So the point is, uh, okay, I I I I capture this as a reference that we can look at. Uh, there's tab for crypto uh for some of the crypto that we've seen uh supported within the Dcom um uh implementations. Obviously, crypto is something that uh

96
00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:31.199
Lance Byrd: well, it can be. It can be a an issue also uh capturing the the different protocols. I haven't put much in here yet. Um. But

97
00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:39.939
Lance Byrd: point being, you know, on Dcom Org, you can go see a bunch of the protocols for did com v two um

98
00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:52.159
Lance Byrd: Aries agent test harness. I'd like to talk about a bit today. Um, if we have time uh That's something that I've been going through and uh looking at in terms of being able to demonstrate support

99
00:13:52.170 --> 00:14:02.179
Lance Byrd: uh across the agents. Um, yeah, we have did methods on here. Uh, obviously, if you don't, if your agent, for instance, Doesn't

100
00:14:02.290 --> 00:14:11.989
Lance Byrd: support did peer. Well, you know, if if someone's expecting to make a a did peer uh connection with you, and that's going to be an issue. So uh

101
00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:29.729
Lance Byrd: uh this. This survey, if we'll call it that is super young right? So it could change in any way i'll. I'll appreciate any uh suggestions. I would say, maybe this tab is one of the most important right now. Uh which is the implementations Tab. Obviously Sickb

102
00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:57.400
Lance Byrd: has uh uh donated a a bunch of open source implementations. And so some of the I guess more success that we've seen between uh agents is when they use the same implementation of of Didcom right. So if they both are using Sika uh, maybe it's a little easier. Uh And so yeah, that's obviously intuitive. But the goal is for you know, implementations uh, and maybe at some point have like a test harness that

103
00:14:57.410 --> 00:15:11.690
Lance Byrd: allows implementations to connect and and figure out. Uh, if how they interrupt with with the other implementation. So I listed uh Baron's um sitcom type script uh here uh with animal

104
00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:31.059
Lance Byrd: uh, and he had posted that to get. So we we have that Github Link, now um and then occupy has its internal uh work that that hack on and uh Judith have been doing. Uh, and it looked to me that that's uh related to as far. And um

105
00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:34.950
Lance Byrd: Yeah. So I've I've linked to that as well. So

106
00:15:36.430 --> 00:15:38.060
Lance Byrd: any

107
00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:48.220
Rodolfo Miranda: implementations I'm finding for them

108
00:15:54.830 --> 00:15:58.419
Lance Byrd: not put it on there yet. Let's put it

109
00:15:59.650 --> 00:16:01.380
Lance Byrd: here.

110
00:16:02.290 --> 00:16:05.639
Lance Byrd: Uh, let me change this to

111
00:16:07.170 --> 00:16:08.330
Lance Byrd: yeah

112
00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:12.320
Lance Byrd: uh

113
00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:15.560
Lance Byrd: Oh, look over and document.

114
00:16:15.650 --> 00:16:18.930
Lance Byrd: Oh, document,

115
00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:22.680
Lance Byrd: it can be too simple.

116
00:16:23.250 --> 00:16:27.220
Lance Byrd: Uh! And then maybe this is a good time to talk about the type script.

117
00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:30.019
Lance Byrd: Uh, we'll call it the animal

118
00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:47.530
Berend Sliedrecht: Barron. Do you want it to be the animal typescript temple or the parent? Uh: input it's in your repository. Right?

119
00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:50.310
Lance Byrd: Okay,

120
00:16:50.850 --> 00:16:56.529
Lance Byrd: yeah, uh, maybe Alex is a good time to ask some of the questions that you have for that

121
00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:07.450
Alex: for the implementation, like the from of the animal.

122
00:17:07.530 --> 00:17:14.329
Lance Byrd: Yeah, Yeah. Well, Baron's Uh: yeah, he's he works for animal, but he's doing the work under his own repository. So

123
00:17:16.079 --> 00:17:32.450
Lance Byrd: uh yeah, I mean, uh i'm. I'm trying to reproduce the error right now, so give me a second because it's like a dependency issue on our end. So no, let's let's do updates on the uh since we have Judith and Hacken. Let's uh do some status updates uh

124
00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:36.610
Lance Byrd: uh for the occupy work.

125
00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:39.230
Uh:

126
00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:55.160
Judith Högerl: okay, you guys want to give us any updates on uh what you're doing and what you're doing, and from the implementation side,

127
00:17:55.170 --> 00:18:02.949
Judith Högerl: and was basically changing, or like making a new folder B: three for the message structure of B, two of that can be two

128
00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:04.599
Judith Högerl: in a

129
00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:15.329
Judith Högerl: So what now has not been done yet is actually to adapt uh the encryption, because right now it's not sure where it gets the information from which type of encryption should be used.

130
00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:29.230
Judith Högerl: And that's also connected to the problem of um how the connection should be implemented. Because if you know from the beginning which connection is implemented, or if it's, for example, if we also should update the version of of out of band protocol for that convey to.

131
00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:48.770
Judith Högerl: Then it would be known that okay, we're using that can be two now and then. We can also that the encryption to that can be two, and then use, like the message director they can be to. So what has been done so far is just adopting the Ma structure, or like enabling the message structure for it can be to. But yeah, missing is encryption, and

132
00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:53.179
Judith Högerl: probably it's already implemented in the

133
00:18:53.440 --> 00:19:09.790
Judith Högerl: this encryption. So it just has to be used at some point. So it's just to some point. It has to say, Okay, pack the the envelope in this encryption type, but the necessary information must come from somewhere, and this is probably would be the easiest way to have a connection, for it can be to.

134
00:19:09.890 --> 00:19:15.829
Judith Högerl: And then, knowing from like which type of encryption should be used for the further comp and communication.

135
00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:23.579
Lance Byrd: Yeah, we talked a bit about the uh kind of connection. Uh,

136
00:19:24.090 --> 00:19:35.750
Lance Byrd: yeah, it. Ha, ha, ha! Can From last week. Yeah, we were talking about like a A. V one connection to uh. Is there anything come of that, you know over the last week

137
00:19:35.760 --> 00:20:01.919
Hakan: I did make a bit of progress there, and I I can at a couple of things. So first I I shared the pull request right now on the Ch. And the chat, so you can uh put it here officially as well if you want um. One area that I was looking into was basically to understand, like, uh, Okay. So we have the connection connections. Ids connection protocols. Uh: we have did exchange, we have out of band. And it actually occurred to me

138
00:20:01.930 --> 00:20:05.299
Hakan: that's uh, all these problems that

139
00:20:05.650 --> 00:20:13.600
Hakan: occur to me basically what the connection has been actually talked about in the areas in top of the profile two,

140
00:20:13.820 --> 00:20:32.210
Hakan: and in a way that we are actually facing out of the connection Protocol. So it's not a part of the I a ip, two uh, instead of that, we are using two protocols, one of them being the Did Exchange protocol. So if we know the um

141
00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:43.479
Hakan: public did, if there is, as public did, the data Exchange protocol helps to just establish a connection between uh two parties. And um,

142
00:20:43.490 --> 00:20:58.680
Hakan: if it's supposed to be like a broadcast kinda uh information again, where uh the public that is not known. In that case uh, the inviteer basically can post a out of band message using the out of Band Protocol two point zero.

143
00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:19.060
Hakan: And the way it seems like to me is that uh, in order to, so we will continue using the Uh Eo connection. Id as as a concept, because it's been used in uh every uh framework that I've taken a look into. I assume it's the same in the Javascript framework,

144
00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:24.109
Hakan: so that that is using them uh python is using them. Go is using them.

145
00:21:25.530 --> 00:21:27.790
Hakan: And um,

146
00:21:28.290 --> 00:21:42.269
Hakan: what's what we did exchange is already there as well and out of pen is already there as well. So I think what we will just need is to fix the message structures and create additional endpoints either to the existing Um, yeah,

147
00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:52.410
Hakan: Api uh cluster, so to speak, or create like the two point, all versions of them. But um, yeah, I think this is more about the question.

148
00:21:52.800 --> 00:22:01.570
Hakan: Uh, maybe to the Aka Pug group as well, because it's really more in the internal area for uh, how how python implementation should happen.

149
00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:08.579
Hakan: But yeah, I mean, if if this was also like a question for you guys like, I think it's Um,

150
00:22:09.230 --> 00:22:16.209
Hakan: yeah, it's. It's it's been already thought about. What are my next

151
00:22:16.450 --> 00:22:25.189
Hakan: points, or like not problems with the say uh, uh uh questions that that actually occurred to me is, basically I think we will need a new interoperability profile

152
00:22:25.210 --> 00:22:41.509
Hakan: uh for Aries. So we have a Ip one which was about Indie, a Ip two point. Oh, which was in the direction of this Con. V two. But it's not completely right, and so I think we will need another interoperability Profile uh revolving around the did convey to,

153
00:22:42.530 --> 00:22:45.739
Hakan: which is missing right now. It's not there.

154
00:22:55.320 --> 00:23:07.059
Hakan: Yeah, Yeah, that that stuff. But it is out of hyper ledger. I think it's it's not a part of the hyper ledger. It is the essential identity foundation,

155
00:23:07.100 --> 00:23:20.000
Hakan: no problem. But, uh, we, we might still need an into a probability profile uh for Aries basically to, so that we can actually get along with the areas. Implementations. First of all, using did come V two uh,

156
00:23:20.070 --> 00:23:24.180
Hakan: but also include things that will help us to be able to, uh,

157
00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:33.740
Hakan: uh create relationship with the software that are using this company to, but not using Aries framework like what uh admin was implementing.

158
00:23:34.410 --> 00:23:44.089
Snorre Edwin: And so basically the first issue you're going to stumble upon is potentially message protocols.

159
00:23:44.150 --> 00:23:47.460
Snorre Edwin: I can share a link here which is open.

160
00:23:48.510 --> 00:23:54.639
Snorre Edwin: Uh we had a lot of our discussions on this little a repo right here

161
00:23:54.770 --> 00:23:58.360
Snorre Edwin: uh we're supposed to now

162
00:23:58.510 --> 00:24:00.359
Snorre Edwin: where we started with

163
00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:10.409
Snorre Edwin: trying first and foremost, trying to figure out what are the messages going back and forth? Um, Because the only way we now see it that

164
00:24:11.210 --> 00:24:19.960
Snorre Edwin: this uh yeah software will talk to each other is that you basically have a way to tackle

165
00:24:20.460 --> 00:24:32.920
Snorre Edwin: multiple different messages. Uh: So you see, how is your flow? You can look at that last the first one there um the the uh I mean. Then uh how Number seven or number two. Sorry

166
00:24:33.630 --> 00:24:37.089
Lance Byrd: I got you.

167
00:24:37.620 --> 00:24:47.990
Snorre Edwin: So you see that we had an flow that was almost similar to what Wacky has proposed. Uh, but also Brian and everyone else. If you scroll further down

168
00:24:48.810 --> 00:24:50.990
Snorre Edwin: uh have the vacuum

169
00:24:51.110 --> 00:24:57.030
Snorre Edwin: uh flow message. And if we what we figure out is that since uh,

170
00:24:57.210 --> 00:25:03.970
Snorre Edwin: various people came in and was not able to change up their messages, we had basically had to land on

171
00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:13.319
Snorre Edwin: what profile they use. Uh, and we decided to then split the groups into a group that can support this mess.

172
00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:14.670
Snorre Edwin: Does it flow.

173
00:25:14.830 --> 00:25:17.740
Snorre Edwin: Um. And then

174
00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:21.790
Snorre Edwin: that's where the first four happened. Basically

175
00:25:24.570 --> 00:25:25.520
Snorre Edwin: Uh-huh.

176
00:25:26.020 --> 00:25:44.620
Snorre Edwin: Uh. So the question is, then, what is issues of credential in did come into our areas like this is, it happens quite fast before um. You see that things are not starting to collaborate unless um both software. Supports both

177
00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:47.540
Hakan: mess expected message structures.

178
00:25:48.730 --> 00:25:49.570
Hakan: Yup!

179
00:25:54.350 --> 00:26:09.089
Snorre Edwin: Um! So what what we want people to do? They want them to say, Hey, implement all these messages? They mean the same. Or uh, do we need to find? Basically Say, hey, guys, a really good profile is the wacky one?

180
00:26:09.100 --> 00:26:17.220
Snorre Edwin: Uh, because the next step of this journey was okay. Now, we need to deliberate in detail What's inside? East met each message?

181
00:26:17.250 --> 00:26:31.469
Snorre Edwin: Then we saw this All that. Hey, Brian suggestions He had too much. Uh do we want to use presentation exchange. That was like the first hinder. Uh, because then you need to do that. Uh, and if you don't, but

182
00:26:31.590 --> 00:26:36.610
Snorre Edwin: you can basically probably uh identify what's

183
00:26:36.910 --> 00:26:49.249
Snorre Edwin: what this particular protocol will use of uh their attributes inside of it like will I use uh presentation exchange message, or what will I use doesn't matter. But

184
00:26:49.260 --> 00:27:00.940
Snorre Edwin: I think that there are. These Protocols are the first hindered that has to be clarified um to be making trouble, and that's probably where it did come up, or it comes in. But yeah,

185
00:27:00.950 --> 00:27:16.100
Hakan: just quick question uh aren't, the uh message structures of the messages which which messages are to be, since uh specified in the Uh Protocols themselves, like issue credential or present proof protocol, for instance.

186
00:27:16.610 --> 00:27:35.730
Snorre Edwin: Uh um good question, maybe. Uh, but uh, if it is, then Wacky is not necessary. I mean, I believe Wacky also specifies a lot what's inside of It's: Messages: Oh, yeah, this this is connected to so. Um:

187
00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:58.679
Hakan: So yeah, that that that was because I I think the messages that are supposed to be supported are uh written here. Well, I think three of them are required, and one of them is the optional to one that is, uh for negotiating.

188
00:27:59.630 --> 00:28:01.040
Rodolfo Miranda: Um:

189
00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:06.129
Hakan: Yeah, Then then the question comes against It's been like is this?

190
00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:10.530
Hakan: Yeah, it it would it still be be a problem

191
00:28:10.550 --> 00:28:15.429
Hakan: uh in terms of what needs to be implemented if it's like already in the spec insight.

192
00:28:17.020 --> 00:28:20.619
Snorre Edwin: Uh no, not really. But then it just um!

193
00:28:21.550 --> 00:28:25.249
Snorre Edwin: And then it comes down to how

194
00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:42.439
Snorre Edwin: willing is everyone wanting to implement all different versions and the different actions that's gonna happen when a certain message comes in. And if you're able to pack it, that inside some simple uh libraries that's basically consume some

195
00:28:42.710 --> 00:28:47.940
Snorre Edwin: action helpers. Then you have an abstracted that, at least for the next developer in line.

196
00:28:49.980 --> 00:28:52.230
Snorre Edwin: Um, But yeah, um,

197
00:28:52.380 --> 00:28:55.489
Snorre Edwin: not sure how to solve it. It's just It's quite

198
00:28:56.080 --> 00:28:58.519
Snorre Edwin: big when we started to discuss.

199
00:28:59.350 --> 00:29:06.580
Snorre Edwin: Uh, first of all, you just need to decide on what profile to use that it might be easier.

200
00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:14.450
Snorre Edwin: Uh, but we kind of. We crashed there at the first meeting, so we had to fork two groups.

201
00:29:17.830 --> 00:29:18.810
Hakan: Okay,

202
00:29:20.770 --> 00:29:21.840
Hakan: interesting.

203
00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:34.490
Rodolfo Miranda: I I think that that the um what it takes, or or if your credential version three and doesn't through person please, it's a nice target, so we we can

204
00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:42.140
Rodolfo Miranda: all align to that right, and that that would be a a nice call, because it's kind of similar to version two.

205
00:29:42.270 --> 00:29:55.809
Rodolfo Miranda: It's just translating the the it's actually the same right, the same flow on the the the on the format of the messages. The the only difference how how you put everything inside the body right?

206
00:29:56.020 --> 00:29:56.900
Hakan: Mhm

207
00:30:02.390 --> 00:30:17.139
Hakan: So maybe as a next work. Item, I could maybe make you that. So take a look into which protocols are needs necessary for the did convey to profile, because we, we we will need to create a new internal profile.

208
00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:28.120
Hakan: I I I don't see any other way around, like whether call it vaki profile or not. It doesn't matter, we will need to specify the protocols. That, uh ares is supposed to support basically

209
00:30:50.770 --> 00:31:09.830
Rodolfo Miranda: uh thinking of having like a nation that that would be like, hey? Regular trust being protocol. But to check for the trusting is working and provide. Uh well that all the envelopes and encryption is working. So trusting should be one of those portal that have to be on the on the profile.

210
00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:16.390
Rodolfo Miranda: Um, What it takes for me is it's just the they call Yeah, the men the the initial.

211
00:31:19.330 --> 00:31:20.290
Yeah.

212
00:31:22.210 --> 00:31:26.980
Lance Byrd: So uh excuse my ignorance just a little bit. Um.

213
00:31:27.140 --> 00:31:45.620
Lance Byrd: But I feel like this is important to cover. So the in the did come uh current did come back. We have these defined profiles. Uh? And so Hawkins basically, saying, Well, the probably occupy is up to this. Possibly this point

214
00:31:45.630 --> 00:32:06.039
Lance Byrd: with didcom uh aip to uh envelope, Rfc: five hundred and eighty-seven. It probably has both of these right? Yeah. But we're still using Rfc. Nineteen, mostly, so that that would be the productive state. So there are several Rfcs tied to these profiles,

215
00:32:06.050 --> 00:32:14.359
Lance Byrd: but i'm Fuzzy on what it will mean for this profile to be supported.

216
00:32:14.370 --> 00:32:43.920
Lance Byrd: Yeah, let's can we discuss that a little bit as a group? Uh I I get to play the guy who just uh is super fuzzy on this. Maybe you guys are sharper on it, but if I can get it, then then I think you know the documentation will be better, because i'll I'll try to, uh, you know, dumb it down for for people like me who I understand that that we we need these. Uh we we supposedly interoperability will occur. Uh, if um someone

217
00:32:43.930 --> 00:32:47.679
Lance Byrd: implements this particular profile, I just

218
00:32:47.830 --> 00:32:52.210
Lance Byrd: i'm not clear on what What does that mean? For for as here?

219
00:32:52.220 --> 00:33:12.060
Hakan: Exactly. So this is why I was suggesting that you come up with the profile. But, uh, is the very, very uh yeah, basic of it like that would cover what you did was implementing, uh in the past couple of months with the message structure of issue credentials and proof v. Three protocols, those what belong to. For example, this profile,

220
00:33:12.090 --> 00:33:23.609
Hakan: basic messaging two point. So that would belong to this profile. Um: yeah. But for the rest, I would need to take a look into this as well as in my I I don't know them by memory, but

221
00:33:23.790 --> 00:33:43.140
Hakan: th this is what we're trying to issue right like. So when we're using the discovery to profile, we're gonna use certain protocols that we can interact with each other. And then we the profile defines uh which protocols. We align with? Basically and uh, yeah, twelve of them would be issue, credential and present for v. Three protocols.

222
00:33:46.510 --> 00:33:49.220
Lance Byrd: Okay, to how? Um,

223
00:33:49.300 --> 00:33:52.849
Lance Byrd: Not even sure exactly what to ask here.

224
00:33:53.320 --> 00:33:59.020
Rodolfo Miranda: Yeah. But I think the the profile that is written in the spec It can be true, it just.

225
00:34:10.250 --> 00:34:12.560
Rodolfo Miranda: But we should cover an eighties

226
00:34:12.770 --> 00:34:20.279
Rodolfo Miranda: a Ip, whatever that they can be, too. But so same, you support this.

227
00:34:26.239 --> 00:34:28.359
Lance Byrd: Okay,

228
00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:41.309
Lance Byrd: Do we think it Would that literally be aip three, then, or do, or people familiar with kind of how this is growing as a

229
00:34:42.699 --> 00:34:48.259
Lance Byrd: as a scheme. Do we know if there is an aip three already in the works that possibly lists,

230
00:34:48.340 --> 00:34:55.570
Hakan: not to my knowledge. We do not have it yet, But I think this is gonna be a a task for us as well.

231
00:34:56.520 --> 00:34:57.580
Lance Byrd: Okay,

232
00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:09.089
Rodolfo Miranda: maybe we can raise the topic to the end. It is called Okay, when I have like profile for did it come beat you

233
00:35:09.620 --> 00:35:10.790
Lance Byrd: right?

234
00:35:11.370 --> 00:35:12.500
Lance Byrd: Okay,

235
00:35:12.730 --> 00:35:13.660
Lance Byrd: All right?

236
00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:18.109
Fair enough.

237
00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:25.109
Lance Byrd: Uh let's see. Raise uh,

238
00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:35.910
Lance Byrd: okay,

239
00:35:39.890 --> 00:35:44.840
Lance Byrd: Good. Is there anything else we want to say on that? Or

240
00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:59.040
Lance Byrd: I? I just feel so uneasy with it. But you know i'll I'll catch up over time hopefully. Uh, and I guess Yeah, there's just we there's work that we need to do to make this more concrete.

241
00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:07.209
Lance Byrd: I I I sense that the Wackypex conversation that we just had

242
00:36:07.430 --> 00:36:14.389
Lance Byrd: I mean this. I feel like It's getting the heart at the heart of what this group is meant to do,

243
00:36:14.430 --> 00:36:24.800
Lance Byrd: which is to help everyone to know the path of least resistance, for for these interrupts so um,

244
00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:33.399
Lance Byrd: hey, i'm! We have. We have this guidebook. Um.

245
00:36:36.300 --> 00:36:48.949
Lance Byrd: This guidebook is really what we want to uh improve. So like the spreadsheet that I showed, even though it's focused on like Aries in or out of the the real hope is that this

246
00:36:49.150 --> 00:36:50.819
Lance Byrd: uh um!

247
00:36:51.490 --> 00:37:07.229
Lance Byrd: This will lead to a a guidebook that just makes it much easier for a bunch of uh, you know, did come V. Two uh implementers like for the Jf. Challenge that they can just come through and read through this, and literally um

248
00:37:08.380 --> 00:37:10.000
Lance Byrd: um

249
00:37:13.350 --> 00:37:18.449
Lance Byrd: not have to go through all those pain points that that they experienced. Um.

250
00:37:19.870 --> 00:37:23.040
Lance Byrd: So yeah, I I guess. Uh,

251
00:37:24.530 --> 00:37:27.149
Lance Byrd: I think I

252
00:37:27.950 --> 00:37:31.019
Lance Byrd: obviously these discussions uh

253
00:37:31.180 --> 00:37:37.589
Lance Byrd: revolving around this profile, and what the Aries interrupt profile, I think I think,

254
00:37:38.270 --> 00:37:44.209
Lance Byrd: will be the key. So sorry. Sorry, i'm stumbling through that and processing. But, uh,

255
00:37:45.340 --> 00:38:02.789
Lance Byrd: I am just not as grounded on the implementations as most of you are. Yeah. So maybe one information. I will also meet with the Steven Korean tomorrow for the areas cloud Asian Python, uh user group

256
00:38:02.930 --> 00:38:09.229
Hakan: meeting. And at that point I can also ask if there are any profiles that have been

257
00:38:09.640 --> 00:38:16.470
Hakan: in the conceptualization for the Uh did compute. So basically, if there's anything I would update this page. Basically

258
00:38:17.180 --> 00:38:23.640
Lance Byrd: Yeah, uh, yeah, that sounds good. Yeah, we definitely want to

259
00:38:24.390 --> 00:38:36.840
Lance Byrd: kind of spread awareness through all these things. I'm: sure, Steven, this is one of those things where we're partly trying to catch up on where everybody is in their mental model, because obviously, Stevens

260
00:38:36.850 --> 00:38:48.939
Lance Byrd: spent quite a bit of time thinking about these kinds of things. But a lot of times. What happens is there's a lot of thought, a lot of talk, uh, and then. But now, you know, you guys are doing the

261
00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:58.699
Lance Byrd: the real important work which is doing the implementations and actually trying to make connections across each other or make did come communications across each other. So

262
00:38:59.190 --> 00:39:01.270
Lance Byrd: we're just yeah, Let's

263
00:39:01.310 --> 00:39:19.079
Lance Byrd: continue to try to tie this together. I don't know how that will necessarily affect the the spreadsheet, and you know, hopefully improve it. But, uh, yeah, I I will also try to attend this meeting. I've I've been in at least some of the acupug uh meetings. So

264
00:39:20.170 --> 00:39:21.109
Lance Byrd: good.

265
00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:25.599
Lance Byrd: Okay, Um,

266
00:39:26.540 --> 00:39:31.710
Lance Byrd: Alex. How are you doing on. Uh? Do we have anything else that we wanted to say about the occupy?

267
00:39:32.370 --> 00:39:34.389
Lance Byrd: They come v two stuff.

268
00:39:42.090 --> 00:39:50.660
Lance Byrd: Um there, maybe, Baron, if you want to give us just a little update of you know kind of where you're at what your kind of short-term goals are.

269
00:39:51.750 --> 00:39:55.760
Berend Sliedrecht: Uh, yeah, yeah, sure. Um. So

270
00:39:55.920 --> 00:40:14.489
Berend Sliedrecht: Yeah, I've been trying to create my own. This company to library based on the sixp one uh, but with some small changes. Um. So the idea is is that it would be impure typescripts uh, without a secrets that's resolver or crypto provider.

271
00:40:14.820 --> 00:40:26.399
Berend Sliedrecht: So the Sigma Library uh ships its own crypto, uh, which is fine, but it does mean that you have to have a different implementation for your native and for the web and for another environment.

272
00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:28.940
Berend Sliedrecht: So I chose to.

273
00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:37.589
Berend Sliedrecht: Um

274
00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:46.270
Berend Sliedrecht: right now. It is really in a state where I don't even export anything from the the main index. So it doesn't do anything yet. Um!

275
00:40:46.820 --> 00:41:02.980
Berend Sliedrecht: But I've been trying to when, when where I have the time to. Basically, very, you know, if we recreate the dipcom, Rest library from sick by like down to the variable names. So everything is basically the same. Um,

276
00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:06.770
Berend Sliedrecht: once that is done. So once, you know.

277
00:41:08.660 --> 00:41:27.780
Berend Sliedrecht: Yeah, the the the it from Rest library. Um: so once that is done. Uh, when I have a matching interface, then I will see where. Uh, I think they did something wrong, and I will try to resolve that. Um. And the idea is is that

278
00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:42.759
Berend Sliedrecht: um, Because there, of course, with touch script, you have so so many different environments. That's uh yeah, you can implement your own crypto for every specific environment. So with web you can probably use roughly like crypto, although i'm not sure if the

279
00:41:47.950 --> 00:41:49.290
Berend Sliedrecht: um

280
00:41:50.910 --> 00:41:56.140
Berend Sliedrecht: I I will also probably provide some uh example

281
00:41:56.220 --> 00:42:02.419
Berend Sliedrecht: uh crypto uh packages. So you have one for note, and you have one for, uh

282
00:42:03.020 --> 00:42:07.239
Berend Sliedrecht: uh, the browser and one for uh react native uh. But

283
00:42:07.350 --> 00:42:13.330
Berend Sliedrecht: the first version will probably ship without anything like that. So you have to ship you you, or bring as yourself,

284
00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:18.389
Berend Sliedrecht: which can be difficult, but it does mean that the library will work in any platform.

285
00:42:18.630 --> 00:42:19.609
Berend Sliedrecht: Uh

286
00:42:20.410 --> 00:42:21.390
Berend Sliedrecht: I.

287
00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:26.120
Berend Sliedrecht: So you you raise your hand. This you you have a question or

288
00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:33.889
Snorre Edwin: yeah. Um. So I would just warn you of kind of copying their variables

289
00:42:34.390 --> 00:42:36.090
down to the

290
00:42:36.420 --> 00:42:44.699
Snorre Edwin: to exact what they're doing, because i'll erase this issue where a lot of their variables and data structure is not really following.

291
00:42:45.240 --> 00:42:54.589
Berend Sliedrecht: Yeah, Yeah, I've picked that up as well. I I thought, my the document looks very different than theirs. Um.

292
00:42:54.720 --> 00:42:55.810
Berend Sliedrecht: And

293
00:42:56.050 --> 00:43:02.830
Berend Sliedrecht: I think if you use a the document where everything is just its own key and doesn't reference, the

294
00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:06.589
Berend Sliedrecht: uh the verification methods. Then it doesn't work.

295
00:43:07.840 --> 00:43:20.569
Snorre Edwin: Yeah. So I had to write my own like it's called It's mapper, and for and transparent to kind of make sure the data I get from my standard type see to their and

296
00:43:20.710 --> 00:43:28.240
Snorre Edwin: it basically doesn't match the like. The variables are different than from the the actual did

297
00:43:28.440 --> 00:43:34.389
Snorre Edwin: dock variables. So I think it's a a flaw that shouldn't be there.

298
00:43:34.560 --> 00:43:48.660
Berend Sliedrecht: Yeah, Yeah, Like most of the I think the documents I I actually implemented myself, because I also noticed that there were a couple of things weird um with it, and that would not be interoperable. Uh, but it's exactly stuff like that that's

299
00:43:48.670 --> 00:43:58.680
Berend Sliedrecht: uh. Once, like the libraries, I completely cope with copied typescript, and I will go through stuff like that and and change all those implementations. Um.

300
00:43:58.770 --> 00:44:02.879
Berend Sliedrecht: And now I can see if I can create also a Pr. For the

301
00:44:02.940 --> 00:44:04.880
Berend Sliedrecht: the library from Sickb,

302
00:44:05.470 --> 00:44:10.430
Berend Sliedrecht: because I still almost all my structuring code from them. So I can give something back, I guess.

303
00:44:12.450 --> 00:44:13.350
Snorre Edwin: Yeah,

304
00:44:14.870 --> 00:44:34.449
Lance Byrd: yeah, that's great. So this is kind of that classic situation where, if we use something as an initial reference implementation. It's going to improve your work, Baron, but it's also going to improve their work. And then I've you know pretty much everybody's referencing this uh sick bus stuff uh, because

305
00:44:34.880 --> 00:44:42.830
Lance Byrd: they were one of the first uh to market. And you know they've shown shown some some good momentum. So

306
00:44:43.500 --> 00:44:45.670
Lance Byrd: yeah, this is uh

307
00:44:45.830 --> 00:44:50.209
Lance Byrd: it's encouraging, Uh, you know. Bottom line, I think. Um,

308
00:44:52.780 --> 00:44:59.710
Lance Byrd: uh, Have they been fairly responsive in the past? We've seen them being very responsive, So i'm hoping they're

309
00:45:01.530 --> 00:45:05.190
Snorre Edwin: um that to me they respond to only one issue.

310
00:45:05.250 --> 00:45:08.319
Snorre Edwin: And then they stopped, and that's about nineteen days ago.

311
00:45:08.700 --> 00:45:17.440
Snorre Edwin: Okay, um. So I I the last like throughout the development I have raised a lot of issues, and Brian has been

312
00:45:18.110 --> 00:45:27.309
Snorre Edwin: uh helping to populate some of those because these experience the same stuff. Um. So I don't know if it's stopped or not.

313
00:45:27.730 --> 00:45:30.789
Snorre Edwin: Um, but they have not responded from

314
00:45:31.240 --> 00:45:33.060
Snorre Edwin: ninety-one and up.

315
00:45:34.690 --> 00:45:41.769
Snorre Edwin: Um so yeah, I I paying the Daniel Hartman, but he's out of the company. So he's not.

316
00:45:42.270 --> 00:45:43.200
Snorre Edwin: Yeah,

317
00:45:43.450 --> 00:45:46.990
Snorre Edwin: It's not been day since they responded to an issue.

318
00:45:47.040 --> 00:45:48.089
Lance Byrd: Okay,

319
00:45:48.130 --> 00:45:56.839
Lance Byrd: Yeah, Generally we have definitely Daniel Hartman's moved on. Uh, generally we see activity from Victor and from Artem.

320
00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:08.949
Lance Byrd: Any other contacts, maybe, that we have with the sick. But folks,

321
00:46:10.520 --> 00:46:18.049
Berend Sliedrecht: I I don't think that Daniel Hartman moves on. I think you switched companies, but I think he's still quite involved with uh with that con.

322
00:46:18.630 --> 00:46:29.459
Snorre Edwin: But I've seen him, and he says, I have no no, say no leverage to pull them to do.

323
00:46:30.010 --> 00:46:30.890
Berend Sliedrecht: Yeah,

324
00:46:33.190 --> 00:46:41.019
Lance Byrd: yeah, for sure that uh Daniel's been super active uh in in the did come spec and and working group and things like that. So

325
00:46:43.350 --> 00:46:50.689
Lance Byrd: all right, Yeah. Good. Uh, Alex, Do you have your questions? Yeah.

326
00:46:50.840 --> 00:47:00.649
Alexandru Andrei: Yeah. I mentioned to him privately. But the the problem was that I mean, I'm. Maybe we can solve the library. But, like you said that there are no function that are exportable. So whatever I try to do for anything,

327
00:47:00.690 --> 00:47:04.470
Alexandru Andrei: it's saying that we cannot find any.

328
00:47:04.640 --> 00:47:09.149
Alexandru Andrei: Yeah, there's like nothing to getting exported like. There's really inputs and all that stuff. So

329
00:47:09.400 --> 00:47:10.979
those that would be

330
00:47:13.470 --> 00:47:14.490
Lance Byrd: okay.

331
00:47:15.250 --> 00:47:18.390
Lance Byrd: So that sounds like, yeah, mostly just uh

332
00:47:18.510 --> 00:47:27.979
Lance Byrd: you guys will go back and forth that only uh help validate forbearance. Uh, you know, an external user and then parents um helping

333
00:47:28.280 --> 00:47:39.359
Lance Byrd: to uh and and snores help me sick. But to. And I saw Brian as well. Yeah, post a bunch of um issues. So yeah, hopefully, it's like the library improves

334
00:47:39.700 --> 00:47:49.430
Lance Byrd: and we'll we'll keep uh barron. Is this? Is it good? Uh now for us to be uh working with you, or uh,

335
00:47:50.070 --> 00:47:53.410
Lance Byrd: is it too early? What? What? What's your preference?

336
00:47:53.490 --> 00:48:15.410
Lance Byrd: Um. What do you mean with working with me. But using the library or yeah, yeah, using the library, I mean, you. You put it out there, uh which we really appreciate. Uh and yeah, I know that you're uh, you know, actively developing on it. Uh, I just didn't know how useful it is yet for us to be trying to use it and giving you feedback and things like that.

337
00:48:15.920 --> 00:48:35.509
Berend Sliedrecht: Um: Yeah. So right now, it it would be completely useless to to use it. Um, But I think once. Once I have something, some functions exposed. Uh, i'll create a message in the discourse for the this configur group and saying that it's ready to be experimented with um.

338
00:48:35.640 --> 00:48:53.029
Berend Sliedrecht: But yeah, it's it's It's It's still very, very uh every a lot of to do um and small things. Uh, but yeah, it's it's It's getting there, I think, like a a a month or something like some weekends Programming uh should be enough for some first uh uses.

339
00:48:53.100 --> 00:48:55.069
Lance Byrd: Okay, yeah, fair enough.

340
00:48:56.970 --> 00:48:58.040
Lance Byrd: Good.

341
00:48:59.210 --> 00:49:01.870
Lance Byrd: Um, Okay.

342
00:49:02.050 --> 00:49:15.289
Lance Byrd: Anything else that we want to uh discuss? Um, I'm happy to bring up the Aries agent test harness uh stuff. But I you know. I want to make sure that uh, if you guys as uh

343
00:49:15.480 --> 00:49:18.920
Lance Byrd: implementers and and active users,

344
00:49:19.120 --> 00:49:21.589
Lance Byrd: if you have something you want to discuss, let's do it.

345
00:49:25.660 --> 00:49:31.360
Snorre Edwin: I think Edwin's hand is raised. Uh, I'm. Not sure if it's old one or last as almost.

346
00:49:31.980 --> 00:49:36.559
Snorre Edwin: Yeah, a stale hand bring my hand one day.

347
00:49:36.930 --> 00:49:38.220
Lance Byrd: Yeah. Good.

348
00:49:38.470 --> 00:49:51.879
Hakan: Yeah. So regarding the test, sinus, I think we will know more once we know which protocols will be used like It's it's a bit um hard to think about the test times before we think about it to interpret the profile.

349
00:49:52.440 --> 00:50:07.620
Lance Byrd: Yeah. So I I guess all I wanted to bring up is that. Uh, I went. I'm going through the Aries agent test harness. Uh, and looking at what tests currently exist for dead comfy, too, and they have a tag

350
00:50:07.630 --> 00:50:26.209
Lance Byrd: um for for tests that are did come V. Two related uh, and they have some scenarios built up for like out of band uh version. Two, and things like that. Um! What I what I haven't been able to do is find an agent. Um that is,

351
00:50:26.220 --> 00:50:47.400
Lance Byrd: uh able to process those scenarios those did comfy to related scenarios. So i'm fairly new to the areas agent tests. But I guess my first question out to them basically is, how do I uh find the agents that are uh already supporting this. You know this particular scenario or this particular test.

352
00:50:47.460 --> 00:51:06.090
Lance Byrd: Um, maybe that's obvious for people who, uh, you know, have have done it before. But uh, the best that I can see is okay. I configure the uh. You know the current test that I run. I pick an agent, let's say, occupy uh, and then I specify that that specific test which I did. I ran it. It didn't work

353
00:51:06.100 --> 00:51:18.210
Lance Byrd: uh, and I don't know. Maybe I'm, there's uh multiple versions of occupy that I can specify. Uh, And then, for instance, we had talked about the uh Aries uh go

354
00:51:18.220 --> 00:51:27.790
Lance Byrd: uh framework as well, and so I was interested to see if that uh, if those tests would pass, i'm not sure. I was able to get even the agent to

355
00:51:27.820 --> 00:51:29.149
Lance Byrd: to run.

356
00:51:29.380 --> 00:51:36.649
Lance Byrd: But um, yeah, I guess this is. This is my uh initial exploration into it. Any thoughts on

357
00:51:37.150 --> 00:51:42.250
Lance Byrd: the test ours? Does anybody use the area's agent tests, for they come V: two stuff.

358
00:51:48.190 --> 00:51:57.919
Lance Byrd: Yeah, yeah, yeah, Fair enough. So so i'll, i'll continue to um dive in there. Uh, and uh, I guess i'll

359
00:51:57.980 --> 00:52:16.269
Lance Byrd: just, you know. Continue to report back. Basically. Um, yeah, I mean, I could tell you guys uh you know what tests are out there, but it's fairly easy to tell. Uh. You can just search the repository for uh, the added company to tag uh to get a flavor. But um,

360
00:52:16.280 --> 00:52:18.779
Lance Byrd: Yeah, eventually, maybe

361
00:52:18.820 --> 00:52:20.470
Lance Byrd: I Okay. So

362
00:52:20.660 --> 00:52:35.199
Lance Byrd: part of the reason that this is important is for us uh as a community to be able to quickly like plug in an implementation uh, and be able to uh, possibly uh, you know, make a determination of how well you interrupt. But um

363
00:52:35.570 --> 00:52:39.799
Lance Byrd: uh, also did come the three

364
00:52:39.860 --> 00:52:56.930
Lance Byrd: that that uh I I've heard from Daniel Harman and and others that one of the goals is to make that a like ietf uh spec. So like uh. It's more rigor than than what it went through for for diff.

365
00:52:56.940 --> 00:53:02.130
Lance Byrd: And as part of that you need to have a a test harness um that

366
00:53:02.560 --> 00:53:16.790
Lance Byrd: um people can plug into. So maybe the areas agent test harness is to um is a is a higher level. Maybe there needs to be like a more specific thing for did comfy, too. But I think it's a great place to start

367
00:53:16.800 --> 00:53:35.210
Lance Byrd: um, obviously, because even talking about the the profiles uh the aip one. And yeah aip two profile variations uh those have tags within the areas agent test harness. Uh, And so you can get kind of a score of how well you're doing uh

368
00:53:35.220 --> 00:53:53.370
Lance Byrd: in that. So I think I think that dovetails well with um our our new mission, which is to kind of go out to the different user groups and talk about the did come V to profile, and what that means for the next um or variations of Ares agent uh Aries interrupt profiles

369
00:53:53.990 --> 00:53:57.010
Rodolfo Miranda: last one. One question: How do you

370
00:53:57.020 --> 00:54:26.819
Lance Byrd: tell Aka to run us? We did come to you. Is it a flag? Something that you can tell. Now you use. You should use it to me to try this connection with didn't. Don't meet you, but it's not no so um all well, at least as as best as I know. All All that I can do is um. I can specify what agent in the Area's agent test hars that I want, and so I can specify the different roles as well. But I generally just say, you know, minus D, which basically just says default.

371
00:54:26.920 --> 00:54:55.960
Lance Byrd: So all the roles are going to be run by that particular agent. And so, if I specify, occupy, I know that whatever um scenarios that I specify uh to run like I don't run the entire, you know. Stack of of of of tests, I, you know, select some tests that i'm interested in, uh such as the uh out of band, or I can specify all the did come V two uh tests. So if I say, you know, run all the roles uh as occupy, and,

372
00:54:55.970 --> 00:55:00.960
Lance Byrd: you know, run this uh run all tests that have the Didcom v two tag

373
00:55:00.970 --> 00:55:30.960
Lance Byrd: uh it just spins up the occupy agents, and then it tries to run those scenarios with those agents right in each of their their roles. So uh and so that's not telling. Occupy, like hey occupy. This is A did come uh V two test. It's just telling the test harness to run. Only the Didcom V two related tests. So um! It's possible actually, that maybe uh Hacken and and Judith would know.

374
00:55:30.970 --> 00:55:32.539
Lance Byrd: You know better than

375
00:55:32.600 --> 00:55:42.110
Lance Byrd: then me uh oh, sorry. We We only have five minutes left. But uh, yeah, it's possible that they know. Maybe there's some configuration that I can do that uh

376
00:55:42.620 --> 00:55:50.120
Lance Byrd: that. That that would help there. But um, yeah, right now, i'm just seeing that those tests are failing. And um

377
00:55:50.800 --> 00:55:52.970
Lance Byrd: yeah, does that answer your question, Roto?

378
00:55:54.410 --> 00:56:11.779
Rodolfo Miranda: We should work, or we work in the future? We didn't come being one and didn't come to meet you

379
00:56:11.790 --> 00:56:19.989
Lance Byrd: as they're implementing this stuff. There's code that's saying, Oh, this is A. Did come V two message, So i'm going to start processing it as such.

380
00:56:20.700 --> 00:56:38.359
Hakan: Yeah, exactly. So both of them will be supported like it's called V. One and V two, and there's the difference is going to be in the connection uh entry within the internal database to uh either uh communicate with the uh other corresponding Asian with it. Con. V. One or this can be to.

381
00:56:38.370 --> 00:56:52.870
Hakan: And regarding the um, Yeah. And this has not been implemented yet on Akupi. So the only outbound communication that is happening is like through the old discount. V. One envelope, Rfc: zero nineteen, I think, was called

382
00:56:53.170 --> 00:57:09.850
Hakan: um. However, it will change, depending on the basically connection tech uh that that feel it will support like multiple uh didcom encryption envelopes V: one for basically a Ip: One point oh,

383
00:57:09.860 --> 00:57:15.630
Hakan: two point zero. And uh, yeah, it's going to be to encryption envelope for

384
00:57:16.010 --> 00:57:19.040
Hakan: the other into a profile that is not defined yet,

385
00:57:20.150 --> 00:57:33.389
Hakan: and the endpoints uh is the same. I think they will be all there like you should credential V. One is there, for example, issue credential V. Two and issue credential V. Three, for example, all endpoints will be visible on the uh

386
00:57:33.890 --> 00:57:36.019
Hakan: on the back end basically on the Api.

387
00:57:40.100 --> 00:57:44.110
Hakan: So there is no start parameter. What you say start what

388
00:57:44.610 --> 00:57:55.980
Hakan: I I guess it would be possible to say, like I have a flag of like start. Akapi did come V. Two where you only see the endpoints related to this con v two, but um,

389
00:57:56.010 --> 00:58:11.799
Hakan: in a general sense I I It's not a necessity, but it would be an additional addition. Basically But uh, we have to make things a bit, maybe simpler for people who wants to use the Akapi only with this call V two, and just don't even see what happened in the V One work. Basically

390
00:58:21.530 --> 00:58:23.080
Lance Byrd: Yeah, fair enough,

391
00:58:23.940 --> 00:58:43.130
Lance Byrd: we have uh, just maybe two minutes left. Uh, because i'll need to jump into another meeting any any final things. What can we do. Uh also, you know, just to make this time more useful, I mean, certainly, I think if we're reaching out to the other user groups and talking about the did come V. Two

392
00:58:43.140 --> 00:58:46.929
Lance Byrd: profile, and how that will map into aip.

393
00:58:47.290 --> 00:59:05.589
Hakan: I think that'll be super helpful uh what else? So yeah, I think This is what I would like to work on with um, at least to come up with a uh draft of what could be a part of the interpret, but the profile for it could be, too, and we can talk about it maybe next uh meeting

394
00:59:06.150 --> 00:59:13.910
Hakan: to see whether we are missing anything or um, but just like plausible or yeah, just to have a a starting point. Basically,

395
00:59:14.840 --> 00:59:15.910
Lance Byrd: Okay,

396
00:59:16.080 --> 00:59:19.170
Hakan: yeah, I think it would be useful to talk about in a group,

397
00:59:20.860 --> 00:59:27.399
Lance Byrd: anything else that we will want to done or or update for by next week.

398
00:59:27.810 --> 00:59:30.399
Lance Byrd: I think that's a good That's a good goal to have.

399
00:59:31.450 --> 00:59:45.000
Lance Byrd: Uh, I I I will also be wanting to update you all in terms of the areas agent test harness. Um, yeah, just as I discover more, maybe i'll just learn that. Yeah, there's just uh no support for that. And maybe

400
00:59:45.840 --> 01:00:00.589
Lance Byrd: I guess the big thing for me right now is to learn how to discover quickly which um tests are supported by each agent like I I have seen the interop page. Uh, I don't know if everybody's seen this, but we have the Ares Interoperability information page

401
01:00:00.600 --> 01:00:06.909
Lance Byrd: that gives kind of scores uh, and and even scores between agents. Um.

402
01:00:08.260 --> 01:00:24.649
Lance Byrd: But yeah, I don't see any of it. Did comfy to stuff listed, and maybe s in some way they are tagged so that they are not run as part of of this, or maybe i'm just missing it. But anyways, i'll, i'll. I'll have more information as we go. Anything else.

403
01:00:29.540 --> 01:00:43.509
Lance Byrd: Okay, Yeah. Great group today. Good to see everybody. Thanks for uh all the work that you're doing uh and feel free to post anything in the Ares Did comedy to uh Channel. I think the more activity we can get going in there the better.

404
01:00:43.520 --> 01:00:52.489
Lance Byrd: Um, That helps new people also to to have a handle on things. And uh, yeah, i'll probably see some of you at the diff uh, did come meeting. That's later today.

405
01:00:52.780 --> 01:01:02.889
Snorre Edwin: Quick question is, Do you guys have your own challenge somewhere? Is it possible to bridge it between the Didcom discord group, or what's

406
01:01:04.740 --> 01:01:11.069
Lance Byrd: you're talking about? The different one? Yeah, I mean it's certain. Certainly, being active in there is good, too. Um,

407
01:01:11.280 --> 01:01:15.949
Lance Byrd: we had kind of discussed. If this should be a a a separate group.

408
01:01:15.960 --> 01:01:34.309
Lance Byrd: Um, I think if you have like more General did come uh v two stuff. I I do think it's best to jump in the diff one. But uh, if there's things related to Aries specifically, uh then maybe maybe jumping into the the Hyper Ledger foundation channel is is maybe better.

409
01:01:34.370 --> 01:01:37.399
Lance Byrd: Yeah, yeah, thank you. All.

410
01:01:38.150 --> 01:01:40.750
Lance Byrd: Yeah, uh, yes,

411
01:01:41.730 --> 01:01:43.199
Hakan: Gotta go bye, bye,
