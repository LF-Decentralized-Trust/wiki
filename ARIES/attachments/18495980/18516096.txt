16:05:18	 From Timo Glastra : @mike but that's just shifting the problem to another timezone
16:05:52	 From Timo Glastra : Anchoring in UTC means countries that have the weird thing to change times two times a year can deal with it themselves üôÇ
16:12:03	 From Mike Richardson : Then why don't all the other groups do it?
16:13:44	 From Timo Glastra : Because even though Hyperledger is an international organization it's mostly focused on americans
16:13:56	 From Timo Glastra : Just because others do it is not a good reason to do the same imo
16:14:31	 From Mike Richardson : Behave. They are all international WGs the same as us.
16:15:15	 From Mike Richardson : Clearly the UTC idea doesn't work. Which is why we had people turning up at the wrong time today.
16:15:32	 From Timo Glastra : We've had this way before we anchored this in UTC as well...
16:16:01	 From Timo Glastra : Because first someone did it in Indian because that person came from an indian timezon
16:16:10	 From Timo Glastra : Then came Jakub in an European timezone
16:16:19	 From Mike Richardson : All right let's let people vote on it. If people want to keep it as UTC that's fine.
16:18:09	 From Timo Glastra : Yeah sure. If everyone wants to move to another timezone that's fine by me üëç
16:19:07	 From Mike Richardson : Most people here are in European time zones so I just thought, let's anchor it on CET to avoid this confusion every six months. But yeah..we'll leave it to the vote.
16:19:21	 From Mike Richardson : üòùI'm not that bothered really!
16:21:29	 From Philippe Foucault : Question to everybody and Jakub ‚Ä¶ as any of you found a good explanation of OOB for business people. I‚ÄôM trying to explain it, but I‚Äôm stuck in my IT mindset ;)
16:22:08	 From Philippe Foucault : Going to put my question in Discord also
16:27:26	 From Timo Glastra : Adding a property to the connection record sounds good to me
16:27:56	 From Timo Glastra : If we leverage the oob record it means we have to keep the oob records around forever
16:54:34	 From James Ebert : +1
17:01:31	 From Timo Glastra : I need to go
17:01:35	 From James Ebert : I‚Äôve got to jump‚Äîthanks folks :)
