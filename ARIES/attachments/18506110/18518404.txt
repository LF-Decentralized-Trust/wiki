00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:08.669
Stephen Curran: All right. Welcome to the July 1123, Aries on user group meeting.

2
00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:14.200
Stephen Curran: number of topics to go through. I've messed with the order in the agenda

3
00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:19.759
Stephen Curran: in the lower part, but I realized I didn't update it in the summary. So I'll fix that as we go.

4
00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:35.900
Stephen Curran:  we are recording. So we'll be posting this after reminder. This is a Linux Foundation hyper leisure meeting. So the code of conduct is in effect, as is the Linux foundation it trust policy.

5
00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.780
Stephen Curran: I'll post the agenda link in the meeting

6
00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:51.580
Stephen Curran: people are welcome to jump in there and help out with note taking, and add their names to the attendees list.

7
00:00:51.870 --> 00:01:10.270
Stephen Curran: for those new to the call. Welcome! Glad to have you here. If you'd like to introduce yourself and talk about what what your project is, and what what brought you here? We'd love to hear from you, so I'll leave the mic open for a few moments and let anyone introduce themselves.

8
00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.920
John Nathaniel Jr.: Okay.

9
00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:39.299
Robert Simpson: yeah, I'm I'm new. I'm Robert Simpson, and just went through the areas developer. course on edx. And so I'm looking to develop some verifier verifiable credentials. Kind of apps with images involved. So that's the E direction. I'm headed.

10
00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:43.259
Stephen Curran: Okay. you see, go. Just added

11
00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:49.509
Stephen Curran: a a photo to the person credential that is being used.

12
00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:57.300
Stephen Curran: within the problem so definitely workable. There's just a new of Rfc. About using a a you only one of it.

13
00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:58.320
John Nathaniel Jr.: So

14
00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:05.229
Stephen Curran: right good to know. Thanks. Okay.

15
00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:06.840
Stephen Curran: Next up

16
00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:11.319
Stephen Curran: any, or sorry anyone else want to jump in.

17
00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.820
John Nathaniel Jr.: Okay?

18
00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.040
Stephen Curran: All right.

19
00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:48.790
Stephen Curran: as far as announcements go. So I'm going to try to keep this meeting relatively short, the areas framework. Javascript. workshop is on right now. Just started. So I am. I had signed up for it, looking forward to it. So I think I've I've kind of kept the agenda a little bit shorter than it had been and hopefully we focus on the right things. for this, and people can jump over to that that are interested in that.

20
00:02:49.410 --> 00:03:11.670
Stephen Curran:  I can't really 0 8, 2 and 1 0 0 R. C. 3. The release candidate. 3 have have been released. So those are out in the wild and and recommend updates. one of the the last minute things that it really is is part of the dependencies of 8, 1, 8, 2,

21
00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:25.060
Stephen Curran: But if you're using the images, artifacts, you know, container images. 0 8 2 has been updated with this, which is, there was a bug noted in

22
00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:35.430
Stephen Curran: and in and non cred, when using ascar and the credits library where a verification with multiple

23
00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.450
Stephen Curran: revocation registries involved would fail.

24
00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:56.729
Stephen Curran: because of the handling This was something in the python wrapper has now been fixed in credits been fixed in and being fixed in the and on credits. Rs library.

25
00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:07.590
Stephen Curran: but be aware of that one other than that. There's a a, a change log in a number of of new updates in the 0 8 2 release.

26
00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:20.670
Stephen Curran: likely we'll have breaking changes and we're gonna talk about one of those a little bit later in this. So the next release is probably 0 9. Or or perhaps we get to 1 point. Oh, we'll see.

27
00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:33.999
Stephen Curran: 1.0 0 r, c, 3 is identical to 0 8 2 It was an important decision that that I made to start releasing release candidates at 1.0.

28
00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:57.040
Stephen Curran: I'm thinking we were closer to that than we than we were. And so what I've decided to do is just continue the release candidate stream for anyone who was on that but but just simply make it compatible with whatever the latest occupy release is so identical to it. So you'll see those as they go.

29
00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:22.610
Stephen Curran:  I don't know, Daniel. If you want to share any updates on the and on credits rust and occupy. we did a presentation last 2 weeks ago. pr, 276, which is the main work that's gone into that is, has been merged into a branch in Acupy, and there's a project board, and we're getting more developers on that.

30
00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:45.589
Stephen Curran:  Jason, sure. But I'm not sure if he's here today. But we'll be starting on that today. wrapped up something that got merged earlier today. So he's gonna be jumping on that and and pushing on it. And we'll add more people as we as we can. And anyone who's interested in helping out

31
00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:52.440
Stephen Curran: with this work is welcome to join in and and put up your hand and we'll

32
00:05:52.770 --> 00:06:12.950
Stephen Curran: help you get started and get moving on that. this is a very high priority one for us. I'm getting in on credits. Rs, it's a a big effort, and we need to It involves a bunch of clean up and so we'll improve the overall state of occupy. And we're looking forward to getting that in time

33
00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:30.530
Stephen Curran: as well. work on, did Pierre, and 2 did pier 2 and 3 supported occupy continues not too much Updates to make. And and Jason Cyrotak, who is doing the work, is not available today.

34
00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:35.269
Stephen Curran: so I will get much more of an update. But he continues to work through it.

35
00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:58.109
Stephen Curran: with more and more success. But it's a it's a bit of a struggle through both a learning curve and in wiping up on this, and then the sort of dynamic nature of it. Pier 1, 2, and 3. And how Different implementations have come out. So we're really trying to nail that down into a single implementation is consistent across all of the areas libraries.

36
00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:06.269
Stephen Curran: this came up this week. It issue 2289, which is to switch over to poetry.

37
00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:17.980
Stephen Curran: this is a purely a developer's question. And and so I've sort of open it up. Maybe, Daniel, you could talk about it, or others that are proposed.

38
00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:27.180
Stephen Curran: This idea of using poetry. I know I've seen it more and more in projects, but I don't know the implications of it. So I leave that open to others.

39
00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:31.350
Daniel Bluhm: I I'll

40
00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:36.799
Daniel Bluhm: I guess, briefly comment and say that. So I was one that raised that issue.

41
00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:56.219
Daniel Bluhm: if if I'm being honest, I don't feel too strongly about this. If, in fact, by continued using the standard pip stuff that it's been using for a while. I think that's just fine. but poetry does bring some nice to have. It's a it's a better, developer experience, I would say overall and has slightly more

42
00:07:56.570 --> 00:08:06.590
Daniel Bluhm: it. It's dependency resolver, and all the stuff around, like resolving the tree of dependencies and stuff is is slightly better for

43
00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:09.670
Daniel Bluhm: poetry. Then, as as compared to pit.

44
00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:15.189
Daniel Bluhm:  so yeah, it. It's just kind of a nice to have.

45
00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:24.730
Daniel Bluhm: we've got a lot of experience using it on the team, and we we use it

46
00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:43.319
Daniel Bluhm: in our plugins. And it's there's no issues with like mixing it matching between, you know, installing a package that was built using poetry and then using that from Pip or the other way around, so that there should be no change ultimately, in terms of like the actual usability of the package that gets published.

47
00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:46.550
Stephen Curran: Okay.

48
00:08:46.770 --> 00:08:52.809
Stephen Curran: anyone else? want to comment on poetry versus Tip.

49
00:08:53.700 --> 00:09:08.199
John Nathaniel Jr.: I, internally, I agree with Daniel. The the resolver is a absolutely, very, very beautiful. So I think that direction is it is very welcome.

50
00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:09.360
Stephen Curran: Okay.

51
00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:19.459
Stephen Curran: what is the type of effort to do? the transition. Is it just a single Pr to

52
00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:24.689
Stephen Curran: basically go through everything and change it? Obviously the Github actions change

53
00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:25.930
Stephen Curran: alright.

54
00:09:26.830 --> 00:09:32.679
Stephen Curran: It's a breaking change. So this would be a good time to do it, because we have breaking changes going into this release.

55
00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:50.699
Daniel Bluhm: I I guess it depends on how you define a breaking change. It's a it's a breaking change in the sense of. If you're a developer on the project, then there's a bit of a change in work, though, but as a consumer of of either the container images or the package that gets published to pipe by, there's no change.

56
00:09:52.890 --> 00:09:54.290
Stephen Curran: Okay, okay?

57
00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:03.650
John Nathaniel Jr.: I I would say I would say

58
00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:12.669
John Nathaniel Jr.: but I don't do it now, but I change as much or not as some point going to happen. So

59
00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:15.479
John Nathaniel Jr.: Radically ped for litter. We can just

60
00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:23.760
John Nathaniel Jr.: go ahead. So I'd leave a big change is not much for those that are not developed by.

61
00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:24.950
Stephen Curran: Okay.

62
00:10:25.270 --> 00:10:26.270
John Nathaniel Jr.: so

63
00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:33.179
Stephen Curran: I would say we should encourage someone with to poetry, experience to code in a

64
00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:41.699
Stephen Curran: make the change. and then we'll announce it and and just make it known to all developers working on occupy about the change.

65
00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:44.250
Stephen Curran: And right

66
00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:57.180
Stephen Curran: any, I guess. The other way to put this is from any of the developers, any any issue with doing that

67
00:10:57.830 --> 00:11:02.730
Stephen Curran: any anyone against the idea of using poetry versus what's being used now.

68
00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:11.329
Stephen Curran: I mean, it is, it is 2 extra characters when doing an install.

69
00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:13.070
Stephen Curran: It's like.

70
00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:22.710
Jason Sherman: I guess my only comment would be, What's what's the scope? Are we changing all the images?

71
00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:30.790
Jason Sherman: to use poetry, or we leaving all the requirements text in there. So basically using poetry to do the

72
00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:41.620
Jason Sherman: dependency resolving and then just exporting them as requirements up. And just like I. I'm using poetry. So I'm fully on board. With that I just kind of want to know what the scope is

73
00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:48.599
Stephen Curran: my assumption. And but I could be wrong, my assumption would be, we basically change.

74
00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:55.610
Stephen Curran: we include the Github actions that are producing the dependencies to also use poetry.

75
00:11:57.290 --> 00:11:59.869
Daniel Bluhm: Yeah, that's what I would recommend. We could.

76
00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:11.290
Daniel Bluhm: as Jason was saying, we could, you know, just export a a requirements, file from the lock using poetry and use that to install. But I I would definitely recommend just

77
00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:17.490
Daniel Bluhm: doing wholesale shift to poetry wherever we use it or where we where we're using Pip right now, that is.

78
00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:20.279
Jason Sherman: okay, sounds good. Yeah, I just yeah.

79
00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:21.240
Jason Sherman: it's it.

80
00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:22.790
Stephen Curran: Yeah. Okay.

81
00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:36.690
Stephen Curran: so invite anyone to make the change. If someone wants to say they're gonna do it now. so that there's not multiple people working on it. That would be great or tag yourself on issue 2289

82
00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:38.790
Stephen Curran: and a Pr is welcome.

83
00:12:39.610 --> 00:12:48.350
Stephen Curran: we've got people with lots of experience, obviously from different organizations that can could evaluate and review

84
00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:51.370
Stephen Curran: So we'll welcome that. Pr.

85
00:12:55.870 --> 00:13:02.760
Stephen Curran: I may. I had a comment in there. just recently yesterday.

86
00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:18.710
Jason Sherman: there's some. There are some dependency conflicts with what's going on in occupy and other assorted things. So you kind of have to pick specific versions of packaging and whatnot. So maybe as part of this, we can smooth that stuff out.

87
00:13:19.070 --> 00:13:30.799
Jason Sherman: so I'll leave a comment in there if I can remember exactly what it was I did yesterday. But it'd be nice to not have to have poetry. Say, Hey, I can't do this, because.

88
00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:38.400
Jason Sherman: yeah. So I'll try. I'll try and remember that it wasn't. Put it in exactly. But it yeah, we can smooth that stuff. That'd be great.

89
00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:39.450
Stephen Curran: Okay.

90
00:13:43.890 --> 00:13:45.880
Stephen Curran: John, do you want to add something?

91
00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:54.000
John Nathaniel Jr.: No, no, no, not at the moment.

92
00:13:54.630 --> 00:13:56.140
John Nathaniel Jr.: Sounds good.

93
00:13:56.290 --> 00:14:04.339
Stephen Curran: Okay. Next topic is a couple more pr, that we want to process 2295 today.

94
00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:08.640
Stephen Curran: so let's get down to the

95
00:14:08.670 --> 00:14:16.719
Stephen Curran: allow any bid to be public. This touches on the gaming resolver with the vlogging.

96
00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:27.880
Stephen Curran: for instance, did web to be a web to be a a. The public did

97
00:14:28.250 --> 00:14:35.139
Stephen Curran: So we encourage folks to look at. It looks like we have some.

98
00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:36.579
Stephen Curran: some updates.

99
00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:38.730
you being done

100
00:14:39.090 --> 00:14:45.530
Stephen Curran: that. And then if we like this we can get it works. So this looks like a good.

101
00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:51.009
Stephen Curran: a good change, as far as I know, any comments from it, Daniel, or anyone that is taking a look at it already.

102
00:14:53.900 --> 00:15:02.429
Daniel Bluhm: I I've only glanced at it so far glanced at it deep enough to to know that it overlapped with work that I know sic but was was doing so. I invited

103
00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:08.840
Daniel Bluhm: Clement on the sick, the team to comment, and he's now left some. I just haven't gotten a chance to to follow up on that.

104
00:15:09.630 --> 00:15:10.310
Okay.

105
00:15:10.810 --> 00:15:39.160
Stephen Curran:  it also may. I don't know. Overlap with some of the work. It's it's did related. So I did want to get CSIRO to look at it. Jason's heart attack to look at it in relation to the did pier. Yeah, I had the at the same thought. And then I I back steps because it was specifically talking about handling of public dids which I know did period. Yeah, so yeah, but I think it would be valuable to have

106
00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:44.130
Daniel Bluhm: his insights, especially because of how much he has been.

107
00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:52.039
Stephen Curran: Yeah, okay. it's pretty good. What you said that described exactly my thoughts today on it.

108
00:15:52.910 --> 00:15:59.269
Stephen Curran: Okay, next one was this one which is a classic example of

109
00:15:59.550 --> 00:16:14.339
Stephen Curran:  why not to have too many discussions in a task when you should be getting together on a phone call to talk about this. So I'm hoping the right players are here. So the overall issue is

110
00:16:14.590 --> 00:16:21.409
Stephen Curran: a while back. We made it a default to remove

111
00:16:21.850 --> 00:16:26.669
Stephen Curran:  credential issuance records

112
00:16:27.330 --> 00:16:29.200
Stephen Curran: from a.

113
00:16:29.570 --> 00:16:43.889
Stephen Curran: and we did it by having a fly called Preserve Exchange records, and the intent, I I think, at the time was that we would also do this for presentation. It's exchange records for

114
00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:50.999
Stephen Curran: for not only issue credential but present proof, but that didn't happen initially.

115
00:16:51.070 --> 00:16:53.759
Stephen Curran: we do want those removed

116
00:16:53.990 --> 00:17:05.999
Stephen Curran: and in in some cases, but we do want some fall back to allow specific instances not to delete those records if they don't want to. We now have

117
00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:22.600
Stephen Curran: sort of 2 schools of thought and there's been back and forth on this with me, going particularly far back and forth in in deciding which to support. So basically, Jason has implemented this idea that we would remove it.

118
00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:23.920
Stephen Curran: and then

119
00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:29.670
Stephen Curran: and implemented a way to allow the removal to be requested.

120
00:17:30.330 --> 00:17:32.729
Stephen Curran: which is

121
00:17:33.090 --> 00:17:39.539
Stephen Curran: this approach, which is, there are, he has implemented 4 flags.

122
00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:42.120
Stephen Curran: auto, remove

123
00:17:42.470 --> 00:17:47.820
Stephen Curran:  for example, prover or sorry

124
00:17:47.910 --> 00:18:03.430
Stephen Curran: presentation and and then the role of the person. So whether it's a a verifier a holder. or whichever. So auto remove it. Those type. So there's there's quite specific control over these.

125
00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:11.119
Stephen Curran: And that's one way we can do it. The other way is simply add a flag that says by default, we're going to remove

126
00:18:11.150 --> 00:18:23.110
Stephen Curran: any present proof records once they've completed. If you want to retain them, you would use this preserve exchange record. This is their exchange record would apply to both

127
00:18:23.130 --> 00:18:25.500
Stephen Curran: issue that I of them present proof.

128
00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:28.770
Stephen Curran: there's pros and

129
00:18:29.070 --> 00:18:39.609
Stephen Curran: a lot of back and forth. Let's have a discussion here to analyze this.  Jason, do you have a

130
00:18:41.390 --> 00:18:44.300
Stephen Curran: Indian on what ought to be done.

131
00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:51.660
Jason Sherman: not really.

132
00:18:52.740 --> 00:19:12.460
Jason Sherman: I mean, I agree that there's a there are a lot of configuration flags and learning how to configure occupy is difficult to top the way through, so adding 4 more flags as opposed to enhancing the existing one is, I can see, an argument against that.

133
00:19:12.670 --> 00:19:21.459
Jason Sherman: the the reason for having the flags. I I particularly because I'm coming from traction, which doesn't want to retain records.

134
00:19:21.650 --> 00:19:41.730
Jason Sherman:  My thought was more along the allowing the flexibility to do anything. So that's what that was. I don't really. If if the community feels like, Hey, let's just do what the original intent was to have the

135
00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:53.869
Jason Sherman: preserve exchange go across all the exchanges. I I'm fine with that. It's really it's more of a community kind of thing. So you know, having former flags is confusing. Potentially.

136
00:19:53.940 --> 00:20:08.750
Jason Sherman: Flexibility comes at confusion. I guess so. But that that's really it. It's That's where my head was out with And with adding, the flexibility was that I, coming from where I came from, not really being wanted

137
00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:10.100
Jason Sherman: bye.

138
00:20:10.490 --> 00:20:17.020
Stephen Curran: Awesome enhancing that current flag would still, I think, achieve the goals for the traction team regardless

139
00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:18.090
Jason Sherman: the so

140
00:20:20.530 --> 00:20:21.360
Jason Sherman: okay.

141
00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:23.750
Stephen Curran: okay,

142
00:20:25.910 --> 00:20:27.719
Stephen Curran: I I think my!

143
00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:37.590
Stephen Curran: I'll jump in with my views. I I I'm really back and forth on. This is as you can tell from my ridiculous comments on this.

144
00:20:38.030 --> 00:20:49.749
Stephen Curran: My feeling is generally that occupy, and the storage should not be for long. Term. Storage that occupy should be strictly for

145
00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:53.099
Stephen Curran:  you know, protocol

146
00:20:53.110 --> 00:21:04.020
Stephen Curran:  for tracking in flight protocols, and once a protocol completes, it's up to the Controller to preserve any information necessary.

147
00:21:04.220 --> 00:21:12.839
Stephen Curran: So I like the default of removing them all I like the ability to save them if if you want.

148
00:21:13.150 --> 00:21:24.190
Stephen Curran: So my leading was sort of where we were, to begin with, of of having that preserve exchange record as an option to keep both issuances and

149
00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:30.109
Stephen Curran: and exchange. You know a present proof records

150
00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:32.560
Stephen Curran:  often.

151
00:21:33.580 --> 00:21:42.239
Stephen Curran: Well, while any particular agent can do all of those things. often they they won't do both, so there won't even be any crossover.

152
00:21:42.930 --> 00:21:45.380
Stephen Curran:  So

153
00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:54.850
Stephen Curran: I I think I would go with one option. One of these 2 options would be mine. Daniel, you've weighed in

154
00:21:56.350 --> 00:22:06.979
Daniel Bluhm: So I I just kind of thought while you're talking there. so I I think I'm in agreement that I think we should have the preserve exchange record the the

155
00:22:07.170 --> 00:22:09.460
Daniel Bluhm: command line argument that controls the

156
00:22:09.850 --> 00:22:14.769
Daniel Bluhm: or that influences the removal of these records.

157
00:22:14.790 --> 00:22:42.210
Daniel Bluhm: with the only remaining question that I I really had, as I was thinking through this was, Do we really need the granularity of picking and choosing, which records we did or and did not preserve And and I think a better answer to that rather than having more command line arguments, is in the Admin Api. We make sure that we continue to respect the auto, remove parameters on the presentation, and in credential exchange,

158
00:22:43.570 --> 00:22:51.439
Daniel Bluhm: endpoints. And so, if you need that granularity, you have the option to do that through the Admin Api and then otherwise, you know you can.

159
00:22:51.490 --> 00:22:52.569
Daniel Bluhm: You can either

160
00:22:53.030 --> 00:22:57.380
Daniel Bluhm: turn on the hose or turn it off, and that's it. And and I think that would be preferable.

161
00:22:57.810 --> 00:23:00.970
Stephen Curran: Okay, gotta make sure I write a note down here.

162
00:23:01.780 --> 00:23:13.550
Jason Sherman: Yeah, I mean, I I'm that sounds good to me. And I really think that the like say, coming from the traction world the I think they can write a plugin

163
00:23:14.150 --> 00:23:28.629
Jason Sherman: to do to change that behavior right? It's not. It's not a huge deal, and I think at the end of the day the real behavior they want is actually slightly modified. and that they don't want to retain the whole record.

164
00:23:28.630 --> 00:23:53.630
Jason Sherman: They only want to retain a subset which would be like preserved with transform or something, because they only want some historical context to know. you know, when this was sent, whatever, and the conversation, not the all the encrypted stuff. So a very small payload. So I think to me that would be, let let them write a plugin, or we can write a that's kind of specialized

165
00:23:53.630 --> 00:23:54.570
behavior.

166
00:23:54.750 --> 00:24:10.699
Jason Sherman: So I think if we stick with the occupy behavior being option, one respecting the auto removes on the Api and then letting additional funky behavior be in a plugin. I think that's probably the way to go.

167
00:24:10.850 --> 00:24:15.430
Stephen Curran: Okay, do we need to do anything with this to enable that

168
00:24:16.150 --> 00:24:23.840
Stephen Curran: plug in capability? Or could we just move forward with this one and then that can be done at a at A as needed.

169
00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:43.289
Jason Sherman: I would say they they can do it when needed, that As long as right now they have the ability to keep all the records they want, which is, I say, are massive right now, which is not what they really want. But that's just that's just the way it operates. So I think just by having the the Preserve Exchange record option.

170
00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:52.089
Jason Sherman: We'll keep them working just fine until they have time to address like what it is they actually do want to save, which is a small subset of that data.

171
00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:53.960
Jason Sherman: Sounds good. Yeah.

172
00:24:55.260 --> 00:24:56.200
Stephen Curran: Okay.

173
00:24:59.790 --> 00:25:03.630
Stephen Curran: Any other feedback from where they would want to weigh in on this one.

174
00:25:05.250 --> 00:25:12.939
Stephen Curran: At this point we say, we go with one, and we make sure that the admit Api has the necessary

175
00:25:13.030 --> 00:25:21.629
Stephen Curran:  find great functionality that that could provide this, if necessary, that a controller could do what they needed to do.

176
00:25:25.810 --> 00:25:53.110
John Nathaniel Jr.: Yeah, I I think I think it's the optimal solution right now, because I think respecting the auto remove and giving the that guys log in to be able to like, keep what they want. it I I think it makes them more in control. So we don't actually need the full transaction history. Just like it. It's sort of But if we to track about the

177
00:25:53.110 --> 00:25:57.570
history of those stuff. So I think, like, it's the optimal solution.

178
00:25:57.720 --> 00:26:00.350
Stephen Curran: Yes. okay.

179
00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:11.159
Stephen Curran: yeah. I know that topic has come up before which is

180
00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:17.980
Stephen Curran:  that even after you preserve the record, it ought to be.

181
00:26:18.330 --> 00:26:21.690
Stephen Curran: Well, maybe we should talk about that

182
00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:28.530
Stephen Curran: you know, as Jason said, if you preserve the entire exchange record, you've got all the messages that went back and forth.

183
00:26:29.570 --> 00:26:43.450
Stephen Curran: Does it make more sense to, for when you preserve it to preserve a minimum sub a subset of the data, or do we for preserve the entire protocol and leave it to a plugin to do

184
00:26:45.170 --> 00:26:47.230
Stephen Curran: the proving essentially.

185
00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:56.990
Daniel Bluhm: I think I linked towards leaving it to the Plugin.

186
00:26:58.260 --> 00:27:00.629
Jason Sherman: Yeah, I sorry, Daniel, go ahead.

187
00:27:00.650 --> 00:27:13.129
Jason Sherman: No, but that's really all I had to say. I think, okay, because right now I know in traction there is a plug in that tracks. The status change time stamps.

188
00:27:13.530 --> 00:27:30.659
Jason Sherman: So that's something they want to have. they just. I don't think they've sat down to determine what's the end. At the end. We've got this whole thing. What do we? What's the data we need out of it? So I think they can just enhance that the history Plugin to say great when it hits complete stage.

189
00:27:31.370 --> 00:27:45.490
Jason Sherman: Let's remove all the unnecessary stuff. I just don't know if they've reached that stage yet in their  getting user feedback on what? As a business, I need to see, to be able to know what?

190
00:27:45.740 --> 00:27:58.860
Stephen Curran: As transpires the question, which is, if you want to preserve something, you can decide what to prune and what not to bring. What? What do you want to keep? So if we do something in occupy itself

191
00:27:59.220 --> 00:28:09.389
Stephen Curran: to prune the record. we're making that decision globally. And that's probably not the best idea. We're we're gonna go with that strategy. So that answers that question.

192
00:28:10.070 --> 00:28:15.859
Jason Sherman: Yeah, I would I would think it could get very specific for different groups very quickly.

193
00:28:16.340 --> 00:28:17.340
Stephen Curran: That's good.

194
00:28:18.180 --> 00:28:28.049
Stephen Curran: Okay. okay. The last thing I wanted to do then was, are there any other pull? Requests the other one, that is this one?

195
00:28:28.530 --> 00:28:35.610
Stephen Curran: Are we at a point where we can merge this one, Daniel, or you still looking, you didn't get input

196
00:28:37.350 --> 00:28:39.719
Stephen Curran: for anyone on that.

197
00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:42.409
Daniel Bluhm: Yeah, that I would

198
00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:44.920
Daniel Bluhm: just that of.

199
00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:49.680
Daniel Bluhm:  I don't know. observance of

200
00:28:50.230 --> 00:28:56.559
Daniel Bluhm: convention and protocol. I I would appreciate having some review some others, since I I had a small hand in that. But

201
00:28:57.700 --> 00:29:15.689
Stephen Curran: Jason got that one, I guess most likely you're the one to do it. So over to you to take a look at that one. Yeah, I can. I can look at it from a a a coding point of view. But I really, quite honestly, don't know enough about signatures and stuff to if there's a technical

202
00:29:15.850 --> 00:29:20.910
Jason Sherman: thing in there related to that I probably be able to weigh in on that. But certainly from a

203
00:29:21.150 --> 00:29:33.170
Jason Sherman: you know, a, a, a code perspective of what's going on, which I'm sure is fine. But yeah, it's if someone's more an expert in signatures than I am, which I'm sure there are. that'd be great.

204
00:29:33.340 --> 00:29:41.899
Stephen Curran: Okay, you go ahead way in. And they just put in whatever you think is appropriate as a comment. Let's take a look at it.

205
00:29:42.050 --> 00:29:49.569
Stephen Curran: and then we'll decide from there if if we need someone else to take a look at them. Okay, sounds good, awesome. Thank you.

206
00:29:53.580 --> 00:29:58.740
Stephen Curran: we've talked about this one. This one is gonna be stopped.

207
00:30:01.100 --> 00:30:11.449
Stephen Curran: So there's a few players that are are down in the list. that are quite old. so we'll probably take a look at some of them.

208
00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:23.989
Stephen Curran:  this one is is pretty small and and just to do with an OS separator. So I really like.

209
00:30:24.650 --> 00:30:40.580
Stephen Curran: I I just don't have enough knowledge on this one to to decide. But maybe somebody to take a look at that one as well, just to to to clear it off the list.  that that's the last important 10, Daniel.

210
00:30:40.970 --> 00:30:42.829
Stephen Curran: this one!

211
00:30:45.030 --> 00:30:48.240
Stephen Curran:  I'm guessing we want to

212
00:30:49.570 --> 00:30:51.920
Stephen Curran: remove this one, I think.

213
00:30:52.490 --> 00:31:01.910
Stephen Curran: but a decision needs to be made as to whether it has anything that helps with what you're doing with the and on Craig's work.

214
00:31:02.500 --> 00:31:05.060
Stephen Curran: I mean the goal of it was to use

215
00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:11.870
Stephen Curran: the existing things for leisure agnosticism. We now have an ipad where that's

216
00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:16.840
Stephen Curran: that's the basis of it. I don't know if we want to do anything like this.

217
00:31:17.420 --> 00:31:20.400
Stephen Curran: We just close this one

218
00:31:21.270 --> 00:31:32.179
Daniel Bluhm:  so I can go back and and do another quick scan. It's been a while since I've looked at it. But I I think from my memory, I think we're probably

219
00:31:32.470 --> 00:31:39.669
Daniel Bluhm: gonna just end up closing that one. they they very much went in the direction of

220
00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:56.089
Daniel Bluhm: They matched the same interface that existed previously. That was very much defined by Indie, and so anything, anything you would plug into to their interface would have to more or less resemble Indie which is.

221
00:31:56.310 --> 00:32:07.279
Daniel Bluhm:  you know, achieving the same goals of pleasure. Agnosticism, I suppose. But it is a different approach from the non credits interface where we we went back and simplified. And then.

222
00:32:07.740 --> 00:32:09.770
Daniel Bluhm: yeah, yeah, all the complexity of

223
00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:16.050
Daniel Bluhm: in these specific stuff is is behind the scenes as opposed to being right up front in the interface. So

224
00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:39.360
Stephen Curran: yeah, I I can go back and and give that another quick scan to see if there's anything that could really benefit from still. But yeah, almost certainly it's it's it's to be close. So, and that that's a fine outcome. Don't don't be stressed about that, but it would be worth you having a quick look at it. You're the best one to look at it, if you don't mind. Yeah.

225
00:32:39.510 --> 00:32:40.340
Daniel Bluhm: for sure.

226
00:32:40.510 --> 00:32:43.990
Stephen Curran: Awesome. Okay. I think that.

227
00:32:45.220 --> 00:32:57.239
Stephen Curran: Yes, us through these 5. this is being worked on. I don't know about this one. I don't know about this one, so there's a few others we can look at. But I they're not urgent right now you can let them long enough.

228
00:32:57.750 --> 00:33:00.930
Stephen Curran: So We'll look at that

229
00:33:02.570 --> 00:33:16.660
Stephen Curran: and I think that wraps us up. If anyone as I mentioned earlier, anyone is interested in helping out with the inspiration of the and on credit Rs work that has expertise in in occupy internals.

230
00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:19.379
Stephen Curran: I'm pleased to raise your hand, let us know.

231
00:33:19.470 --> 00:33:24.240
Stephen Curran: and we'll be glad to issue with all good that

232
00:33:25.310 --> 00:33:30.429
Stephen Curran: with that, I think. Are there any other topics people want to raise at this meeting.

233
00:33:34.580 --> 00:33:48.960
Stephen Curran: So the the only thing I wanted to follow up on that was on the agenda. There was the extra meeting plan for Maintainers each week. Yes. So one of the things we wanted to do was to have a Maintainer, an extra Maintainer's meeting.

234
00:33:49.340 --> 00:33:57.410
Stephen Curran:  I was thinking, I in the off week, for this is the in the developers meeting. I was thinking.

235
00:33:57.510 --> 00:34:09.650
Stephen Curran:  maybe the half hour after that meeting we could have this one. So 9 specific

236
00:34:10.260 --> 00:34:16.160
Stephen Curran: for 30 min on Tuesdays. Would that work.

237
00:34:16.870 --> 00:34:20.010

And those can happen as well. But it's but let's have a meeting every week to to go over what what we're doing from a security development perspective. This can be more focused on sort of end user things and and Demos and things like that.
