08:30:43	 From Joël Germain : What if, for official credentials at least, they need to be bound to a verified person to be usable within a wallet? So if  it's transfered to an other wallet, as long as a verification of identity is not done, or if an other one is inside the wallet, then the transfered one would be void or unavailable. ?
08:36:18	 From Joël Germain : thank you for the clear explanation.
08:38:25	 From Sam Curren (TelegramSam) : eIDAS 2.0 & the Architecture Reference Framework
