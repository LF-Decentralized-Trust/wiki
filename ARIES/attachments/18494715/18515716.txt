15:42:33	 From Clecio : 1) have you considered any inversion of control DI mechanism?2) I am not a big fan of strict private method contracts. In the wild, when using libraries, I usually get to a situation that the one useful method was defined as private, and need to make a copy of it. I prefer the python approach of private methods been a convention (e.g.: starts with `__`)
