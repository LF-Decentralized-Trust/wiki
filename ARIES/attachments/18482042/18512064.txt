00:17:08	Carl DiClementi:	Is there a rough expected timeline for Indy / Aries split?
00:18:42	Richard Esplin:	The morning call has been focused on discussing what architecture we want in a shared Aries library. Once we have decided that, we can figure out how much effort it will take to get from here to there.
00:19:44	Carl DiClementi:	Perfectly understandable. Thanks Rich. I'll start attending the morning calls.
01:02:20	Drummond Reed:	I find Tobiaâ€™s point persuasive
01:07:10	Kyle Den Hartog:	I hadn't thought of that
01:07:48	Drummond Reed:	That vulnerability is very well known. It just means the verifier needs to do complete verification.
