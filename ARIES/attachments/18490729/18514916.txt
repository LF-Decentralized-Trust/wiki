12:31:22	 From  Nathan George : Apps on one phone cooperating++
12:31:42	 From  Nathan George : (I install all of them to try, I think I have four installed right now)
12:32:28	 From  Riley Hughes : Only four?? I have 14 üòä
12:32:30	 From  Nathan George : (Sorry, just three, the beta for the fourth expired)
12:32:46	 From  Riley Hughes : Nathan if you want some more apps let me know and I‚Äôll send you some links üòÇ
12:33:20	 From  Nathan George : Trinsic Wallet is a good one to compare to.  If there are other code bases with a wallet ‚Äî like an install for BiFold I‚Äôll add those to the ones I show and share
12:43:37	 From  Stephen Curran : Awesome about using Aries Framework - JavaScript
12:43:40	 From  Stephen Curran : Nice!!
12:43:41	 From  Riley Hughes : +1
12:44:23	 From  Pablo Romeu : +1 here too‚Ä¶ üéâ
12:45:07	 From  Riley Hughes : Aries-mobileagent-bifold does a few things
12:45:19	 From  Sam Curren (TelegramSam) : I don't think we want to prevent other codebases in any way.
12:45:41	 From  Riley Hughes : 1. It indicates that it‚Äôs a mobile agent, keeping with prescident set by OSMA->AMA-X
12:46:13	 From  Riley Hughes : 2. It avoids stepping on other react native project toes
12:47:33	 From  Cristian Talle : +1
12:48:32	 From  Steve McCown : Don‚Äôt forget the swift / iOS developers.  :-)
12:48:57	 From  David Clawson : Could be fun to take a look at Swift
12:50:02	 From  Oliveira Medeiros : Yep, im here for iOS Development on a native iOS Framework/App
12:50:45	 From  Riley Hughes : globalId has committed to open source an entire Aries framework in Swift - I wonder where they‚Äôre at with that.
12:51:46	 From  Nathan George : Riley++ we would like to know what they are up to as well
12:51:50	 From  Sam Curren (TelegramSam) : +1 to a mobile coordination call if somebody wants to start one.
12:52:02	 From  Jakub Koci : I‚Äôm also curious about that GlobaliD effort
12:52:07	 From  Pablo Romeu : +1
12:52:10	 From  Riley Hughes : @sam I think many of us thought that‚Äôs what this call was üòä
12:52:52	 From  Oliveira Medeiros : In what repo/link is this ‚ÄúAries framework in Swift‚Äù ?
12:52:53	 From  Sam Curren (TelegramSam) : Which is why this conversation is good. :)
12:52:55	 From  Nathan George : aries-mobileagent-reactnative implies more related effort to aries-mobileagent-xamarin and aries-mobileagent-* than Aries-bifold would
12:53:10	 From  Jakub Koci : But I think mobile agent should be about implementing Aries protocol but building the app around.
12:53:17	 From  David Clawson : https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-shares-ssi-code-at-the-internet-identity-workshop-446debec43e7
12:53:42	 From  Jakub Koci : There should be Aries Java, Aries Swift, Aries JS and these should be used as library in mobile app
12:53:52	 From  David Clawson : Looks like they said they contributed the iOS work to Hyperledger, but no word on the code in the comments
12:54:09	 From  Pablo Romeu : I agree with you Jakub
12:54:44	 From  Jakub Koci : Yeah, but I asked them on Twitter and they respond it‚Äôs not public yet and they are waiting for some approval from Aries community
12:55:45	 From  Nathan George : Not finding the globalid contributions in GitHub, anyone know where they live (there is a wiki reference here https://wiki.hyperledger.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=41588716)
12:56:22	 From  Nathan George : If they respond that they are waiting for approval, let them know we approve of PRs already ;)
12:56:36	 From  Nathan George : We approve already
12:56:54	 From  Jakub Koci : ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
12:56:57	 From  Nathan George : (Obviously we will have the same crazy name debate we always do, but we want them to work in the open)
12:57:04	 From  Nathan George : (And feel welcome)
12:58:16	 From  Timo Glastra : I agree Bifold does sound a lot better
12:58:55	 From  Jakub Koci : I would stay with Bifold and maybe if there is some pressure from the community we could rename later? ü§î
12:59:11	 From  Lohan Spies : +1
13:00:27	 From  Timo Glastra : Aries Mobile Agent React Native (Bifold edition)
13:00:41	 From  Cristian Talle : Personally I like Riley‚Äôs suggestion of aries-mobileagent-bifold
13:00:57	 From  Nathan George : +1
13:04:43	 From  Nathan George : I like James‚Äô idea of aries-mobileagent-reactnative and would advocate for BiFold to be the main App Store release name that someone like Indicio should do
