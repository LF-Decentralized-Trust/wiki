00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:10.789
George Mulhearn: Hello.

2
00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:56.830
Patrik Stas: Hi, George!

3
00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:00.479
George Mulhearn: Hey!

4
00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:01.350
George Mulhearn: How are you?

5
00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.240
George Mulhearn: Hello! Can you hear me?

6
00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:25.429
Patrik Stas: Excuse me for just a minute or 2 before we get started? I just want to prepare a few more things.

7
00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:27.340
George Mulhearn: Okay, now it is.

8
00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:47.659
Patrik Stas: Hey, is there Sorry, George, Can you hear me? I just realized I had the probably my speakers off.

9
00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:50.930
Patrik Stas: Okay, and I didn't hear you. She said something.

10
00:04:51.270 --> 00:05:00.359
Patrik Stas: yeah, that was probably the issue, can you?

11
00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:10.610
Patrik Stas: I was just adding few more things. Few more points to the agenda last last minute. But I think we can get started now.

12
00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:11.800
George Mulhearn: You

13
00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:13.720
Patrik Stas: Okay,

14
00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:16.680
Patrik Stas: So

15
00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:19.040
Patrik Stas: let me share this screen

16
00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:22.410
Patrik Stas: so as usual.

17
00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:23.660
Patrik Stas: i'll.

18
00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:29.900
Patrik Stas: I'll leave this antitrust policy open for a bit

19
00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:34.370
Patrik Stas: and visible in the meantime.

20
00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:48.350
Patrik Stas: yeah, I would like to welcome you, George, and anybody who's tuning in the recording to he's going to call on first first time in 23

21
00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:50.489
Patrik Stas: on January 5,

22
00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:52.100
Patrik Stas: 23

23
00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:55.770
Patrik Stas: yeah, and today there is a

24
00:05:55.980 --> 00:06:00.939
Patrik Stas: bit more interesting at the agenda than usual. As a as I would like to

25
00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:09.379
Patrik Stas: not only go through like the last week day to day. Operation they today work and prs

26
00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:19.829
Patrik Stas: but also kind of review the 2,023, and think about what might be important going forward in 2023.

27
00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:28.759
Patrik Stas: So yeah, let's let's get right into it. So i'll start with the the the usual usual

28
00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:41.280
Patrik Stas: agenda. it should be fairly quick, and then move into the interesting part. So so. As for the recent work done, we have removed, and the

29
00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:43.689
Patrik Stas: public agent

30
00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:54.569
Patrik Stas: a portion of the code base, resulting in nice decrease of 1,000 lines, always always happy to Cprs like this, where we are reducing complexity.

31
00:06:55.370 --> 00:07:05.329
Patrik Stas: So this public agent, abstraction. There was something was pretty much as used for the institutional issue, or very far a use case one

32
00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:15.450
Patrik Stas: so probably not. No, nobody really touched anybody who's using V. 6 on the device.

33
00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:19.909
Patrik Stas: and those this small small pole here.

34
00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:24.490
Patrik Stas: Well, it's already closed, I guess.

35
00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:33.380
Patrik Stas: and I was this short P. Before doing this work, where apparently nobody is really using it. Also, somebody really was using this.

36
00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:41.949
Patrik Stas: So this is gone now. there was some minor refactoring prs which are probably not worth the going into into detail.

37
00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:46.610
Patrik Stas: and then as for what's going right now?

38
00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:56.589
Patrik Stas: we are working still working on the completing not Pr. As base bindings for the no jazz brepper

39
00:07:56.860 --> 00:08:04.390
Patrik Stas: this is also before Pr. In a sense of removing 7,000 lines and adding 2,000

40
00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:09.559
Patrik Stas: in instead. so it's nice reduction of complexity for sure.

41
00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:16.750
Patrik Stas: the the node breaker is much simpler now. it's much faster. It runs with an old 18.

42
00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:26.020
Patrik Stas: It seems to be more stable in Ci. The only piece of work we are now missing. Here is publishing the

43
00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:28.060
Patrik Stas: the

44
00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:31.280
Patrik Stas: and the wrapper to

45
00:08:31.710 --> 00:08:37.939
Patrik Stas: and to the Npmgs, which is a bit more trickier now as we are building

46
00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:40.280
Patrik Stas: because we are building now.

47
00:08:41.409 --> 00:08:47.989
Patrik Stas: note Modules binary file, which we need to distribute along with the repair itself.

48
00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:56.310
Patrik Stas: The along with the javascript files, and that's that's something noble to us. we haven't done before, so we'll have to

49
00:08:56.470 --> 00:09:05.749
Patrik Stas: figure out how to publish it correctly and help publish it for the multiple or different architectures. But it'll be definitely nice

50
00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:18.350
Patrik Stas: also leading to Nice like usability improvement, where basically, when you want to use the Vcx vcx with from Nodejs.

51
00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:29.029
Patrik Stas: you'll no longer need to first compile the rough binary yourself, and then put it into like a system path, and then run the wrapper

52
00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:31.790
Patrik Stas: instead. You will just put that

53
00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:33.240
Patrik Stas: put the

54
00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:36.189
Patrik Stas: A is. This is your dependency.

55
00:09:36.390 --> 00:09:45.940
Patrik Stas: in your note project, and it should download. You know everything I need it, including all the pre compiles for architecture.

56
00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:53.129
Patrik Stas: yeah, so that's that. then

57
00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:56.260
Patrik Stas: we started

58
00:09:56.500 --> 00:10:01.530
Patrik Stas: expand and expanding support for new mediated connections

59
00:10:01.710 --> 00:10:04.940
Patrik Stas: into

60
00:10:05.830 --> 00:10:09.859
Patrik Stas: basically to expose it on the fi layers.

61
00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:13.229
Patrik Stas: there's 2 prs regarding that.

62
00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:20.600
Patrik Stas: and then lastly the the Pr. Which is currently in draft from from George

63
00:10:24.410 --> 00:10:26.859
Well installed. Quit, I guess.

64
00:10:29.070 --> 00:10:42.219
Patrik Stas: yeah, the the Pr. we just adding, which is using critics for verify. But since it's since it's so draft, and and you are here. George!

65
00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:45.310
Patrik Stas: what? What's needed in this Pr. To.

66
00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:49.829
Patrik Stas: you know? Turn it into a Pr. From the draft state. Is there?

67
00:10:50.090 --> 00:10:59.040
Patrik Stas: Is there? Is there stuff missing? I see it's pretty sure, but i'm not really sure how much work is there to do? The very far with the critics.

68
00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:15.629
George Mulhearn: yeah, there there wasn't too much work. There was only really one verify a method which needed to be filled in which was just verify a verify proof. and it it, it seems to be working.

69
00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:21.900
George Mulhearn: have some tests failing because they're not throwing the correct errors.

70
00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:25.830
George Mulhearn: The tests are expecting like a Libindi error code.

71
00:11:25.970 --> 00:11:28.860
George Mulhearn: So now i'm

72
00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:34.349
George Mulhearn: trying to figure out the best way to go about fixing that

73
00:11:34.510 --> 00:11:51.490
George Mulhearn: because I think the right move would be to move away from relying on living the error codes. And yeah for sure for sure, Probably some sort of my custom, maybe customly define error. And then in the in, the in, the in the implementation of the verifier

74
00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:58.679
Patrik Stas: sort of map, that in the error, to whatever a custom a is V: 6 error we need to have or something like that.

75
00:11:58.970 --> 00:12:03.390
George Mulhearn: Yeah, yeah, exactly. Yeah, I I started doing that. and yeah, I just need

76
00:12:04.170 --> 00:12:12.619
George Mulhearn: bit of time to finish that off when I get a chance. but yeah, doing that error stuff will put us in a good place for

77
00:12:12.770 --> 00:12:21.789
George Mulhearn: doing the next set of what is the issue of Api is because there'll be a lot more errors there.

78
00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:23.839
George Mulhearn: and more. It has to do with it.

79
00:12:24.810 --> 00:12:27.390
Patrik Stas: I see I see awesome sounds great.

80
00:12:28.530 --> 00:12:34.090
Patrik Stas: Okay? And now, yeah, now, this is this is for the week, I guess, and

81
00:12:34.570 --> 00:12:39.619
Patrik Stas: going into the interesting stuff. I said, 2,022 review

82
00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:43.400
Patrik Stas: and the and the current state.

83
00:12:43.710 --> 00:12:51.990
Patrik Stas: So yeah, I I think 22 is like really like significant move forward

84
00:12:52.350 --> 00:12:54.100
Patrik Stas: in in

85
00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:56.810
Patrik Stas: many different terms.

86
00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:04.619
Patrik Stas: And maybe i'll jump a little bit here. But actually, I will start with this this this piece here this point here

87
00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:07.329
Patrik Stas: as the increase coming to focus

88
00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:15.340
Patrik Stas: basically like starting for like late summer this year. we started

89
00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:22.189
Patrik Stas: put more focus on like getting more coming, the direction and become more community friendly.

90
00:13:22.460 --> 00:13:24.899
Patrik Stas: so.

91
00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:32.740
Patrik Stas: But we've increased our like discord, activity, and responsibility, and started doing these community calls.

92
00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:36.170
Patrik Stas: and I think it's turned great. because

93
00:13:36.770 --> 00:13:44.820
Patrik Stas: we we we we saw a number of contributors in the Q. 3. Q. 4

94
00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:47.080
Patrik Stas: I guess more.

95
00:13:47.140 --> 00:13:56.000
Patrik Stas: It was. most notably, I would say, you yourself, George, is is, you can with a really awesome and huge pr

96
00:13:56.030 --> 00:13:59.680
Patrik Stas: contribution with the credits integration.

97
00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:04.770
Patrik Stas: but also just recently we saw on discord.

98
00:14:05.290 --> 00:14:11.490
Patrik Stas: added open. Yeah, we we saw a interest from Dinos to implement

99
00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:16.640
Patrik Stas: flutter for.

100
00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:26.810
Patrik Stas: So that's that's that's awesome. How easy, even. he says that he's even planning to open source that and contributed later.

101
00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:33.959
Patrik Stas: yeah, there was also a number of other other contributors,

102
00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:39.560
Patrik Stas: namely, credits to bonfire, and G I. G. 3 P. And t

103
00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:41.200
Patrik Stas: call rps

104
00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:44.970
Patrik Stas: also

105
00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:50.020
Patrik Stas: and then I guess.

106
00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:55.840
Patrik Stas: yeah. So so this this this is important driver for.

107
00:14:56.130 --> 00:14:57.030
Patrik Stas: for

108
00:14:57.230 --> 00:15:01.689
Patrik Stas: I will say, no, actually few few achievements this year.

109
00:15:04.750 --> 00:15:13.379
George Mulhearn: yeah, I think I think it's definitely more welcoming now. Vcx, because, you know, we started looking at in Q. 3

110
00:15:13.650 --> 00:15:19.869
George Mulhearn: of last year, and it was a little mysterious, because there wasn't too many messages and discord, and

111
00:15:20.410 --> 00:15:25.680
George Mulhearn: it's hard to get a glance of what's happening. But there's a lot more interaction now, and it's really good.

112
00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:33.830
Patrik Stas: Oh, yeah, that that's really that's awesome to here. I didn't know that you've been around for so long. Actually.

113
00:15:36.550 --> 00:15:54.090
Patrik Stas: yeah, okay, then, then moving on to more technical technical parts. those definitely progress in modularization and decoupling. So we started splitting out the the individual crates. So now we have a ddo trade

114
00:15:54.370 --> 00:16:14.249
Patrik Stas: messages create, and there's efforts to for the split. Other other bigger crates which for now are like divided into modules. So, for example, recently, Levy cx. Has been, has been split into Api, c. And api vcx.

115
00:16:14.410 --> 00:16:22.859
Patrik Stas: whereas so they are. Comp. And the at the the Api is completely unaware of the upper layer, Api, c.

116
00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:27.489
Patrik Stas: And it's also possible to compile the Vcx.

117
00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:38.379
Patrik Stas: We we dialed the Api see itself, simply excluding it by configuring the rest Cargo features.

118
00:16:38.670 --> 00:16:55.379
Patrik Stas: and then also importantly. And this has been paying for for a long time. We are trying to get rid of the V. 6 Agency Mediator dependency, and just kind of make it optional you know, for at least for now.

119
00:16:57.530 --> 00:17:04.620
Patrik Stas: as although it's it's a pretty useful for the mobile use case, and I think people are using it

120
00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:07.640
Patrik Stas: at the same time.

121
00:17:08.170 --> 00:17:17.520
Patrik Stas: it's. It just makes it much harder for anyone to try out there. Easy 6 right now, as you are kind of

122
00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:23.150
Patrik Stas: It's just this extra dependency extra service you need to have running somewhere.

123
00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:26.640
Patrik Stas: And yeah, that's just like extra barriers. So

124
00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:45.300
Patrik Stas: we'd like to make this optional Also V 6. The mediator itself is not really useful in case you are trying to build. If you're or very far with a is Vcx. So this just kind of adding really extra complexity for such a use case

125
00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:55.349
Patrik Stas: and hands, the work we are currently doing with, adding support for the non mediated connection protocol.

126
00:17:57.290 --> 00:18:10.279
Patrik Stas: and even with the nominated connection. Protocol. You should always still be able to, you know, use the mediation, perhaps aside yourself. But, we don't want to bake it into the Area's Vcx. Itself. Too much

127
00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:17.900
Patrik Stas: so might be useful optional dependency. But we don't want to force this particular medie to implementation.

128
00:18:21.870 --> 00:18:22.880
Patrik Stas: yeah.

129
00:18:25.610 --> 00:18:28.620
Patrik Stas: Then for moving to the next point.

130
00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:44.309
Patrik Stas: I just kind of generic, but lots of lots of energy has been spent on the refactoring and simplifications. I don't have any sort of numbers or metric for this right now.

131
00:18:45.310 --> 00:18:47.260
Patrik Stas: But

132
00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:49.430
Patrik Stas: yeah, that was

133
00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:52.050
Patrik Stas: those

134
00:18:52.960 --> 00:19:07.079
Patrik Stas: along with the testing improvements, I think it's just it's just we. We've been trying hard to make it easier to to read the code and to modify it. This is actually like

135
00:19:07.570 --> 00:19:15.750
Patrik Stas: tides, a lot to the increased community focus. We're in past what we still been paying like old old technical that

136
00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:19.330
Patrik Stas: it would be difficult to actually on board new contributors.

137
00:19:19.850 --> 00:19:22.729
Patrik Stas: But now, with the kinda

138
00:19:23.310 --> 00:19:32.969
Patrik Stas: codes clean up, and technical depth payoffs it's it's. It's really easier, and it makes sense to start

139
00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:36.839
Patrik Stas: start building community, or it's easier to

140
00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:39.360
Patrik Stas: good new people on on tools going on

141
00:19:40.130 --> 00:19:55.560
Patrik Stas: and then the last 2 points was a ith integration. there was a work done by mainly made us now a colleague of my to to

142
00:19:55.990 --> 00:19:59.710
Patrik Stas: increase the the ith coverage.

143
00:19:59.850 --> 00:20:02.069
Patrik Stas: so we have,

144
00:20:02.610 --> 00:20:04.030
Patrik Stas: we have

145
00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:15.110
Patrik Stas: regular integration in interoperability tests now with a of J. And occupy which is it's just nice combo, because

146
00:20:15.470 --> 00:20:28.290
Patrik Stas: many people are using occupy for that for sure. On the other hand, I think many people will also be using Fj. For the mobile use case, so I I find those like a 2 main

147
00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:32.390
Patrik Stas: main pairs to test against. But

148
00:20:32.510 --> 00:20:38.060
Patrik Stas: yeah, going forward, there's still space for improvements for that, enabling more

149
00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:40.280
Patrik Stas: more coverage

150
00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:43.690
Patrik Stas: in the in the short term

151
00:20:59.310 --> 00:21:04.420
Patrik Stas: of December last month of the last year great progress on the

152
00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:07.730
Patrik Stas: No just proper implementation.

153
00:21:07.790 --> 00:21:21.960
Patrik Stas: as I already mentioned in the weekly Progress. we we started using different fi approach, which works like multiple magnitude faster. We know the 18, then the old one

154
00:21:24.290 --> 00:21:29.360
Patrik Stas: And I just also much more maintainable. And say, for all the good stuff

155
00:21:32.460 --> 00:21:34.990
Patrik Stas: at that being set

156
00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:46.540
Patrik Stas: I would I would want to encourage. Yeah, and anyone who was like using as V. 6 for a mobile use case to

157
00:21:48.380 --> 00:21:49.780
Patrik Stas: to

158
00:21:50.340 --> 00:21:53.370
Patrik Stas: either like, try.

159
00:21:53.680 --> 00:22:07.339
Patrik Stas: try, contribute, you know. Try explore different approaches for different approaches than what we do currently with the Java and aisles Ver as I believe there's there's better ways now.

160
00:22:09.190 --> 00:22:28.180
Patrik Stas: and we are solved in the upsa. we are not planning to contribute too much into the Java and Aisles proper anymore. So the fun looking for like contributors in this area. So even in this, in this sense, it's it's great to to hear that

161
00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:42.119
Patrik Stas: dinesh! Is is thinking of contributing new new, more the flock to wiper. So kind of a new approach giving giving new options how to consume the library from the mobile.

162
00:22:43.610 --> 00:22:52.939
Patrik Stas: But yeah, I think there's probably more modern approaches at this point than the way we currently do with the ios and job of

163
00:22:55.620 --> 00:22:58.290
Patrik Stas: I don't have any specific tips. But

164
00:22:58.630 --> 00:23:02.519
Patrik Stas: I believe that there's similar like, with no jazz rapper.

165
00:23:02.540 --> 00:23:06.060
Patrik Stas: I think there's probably better approaches now.

166
00:23:11.870 --> 00:23:15.220
Patrik Stas: perhaps. perhaps. George.

167
00:23:15.270 --> 00:23:27.680
Patrik Stas: you have. You have more knowledge on how to like do at the if I like modern Ffi integration mobile with mobile right? Because you've been mentioning the

168
00:23:28.010 --> 00:23:30.149
Patrik Stas: the the Ffi Library.

169
00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:38.649
George Mulhearn: yeah, I think I think unify Rs is the main one

170
00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:41.300
George Mulhearn: I kind of believe in is

171
00:23:41.660 --> 00:23:44.500
George Mulhearn: being one of the best at the moment.

172
00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:57.320
Patrik Stas: And and when you are like building like with Unifi, you are building just directly on a. Is Vcx. I presume you are not attaching Live Vcx.

173
00:23:57.410 --> 00:23:58.880
Patrik Stas: Part of the code base.

174
00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:19.640
Patrik Stas: Yeah. Nothing to do with Live Vcx: yeah. So I guess. Then there's there's multiple ways somebody might choose to build on. Build some. You you need fi on to on top of Api vcx portion of Lady 6, or perhaps even just directly on

175
00:24:19.650 --> 00:24:20.960
Patrik Stas: there is Vcx

176
00:24:21.780 --> 00:24:25.339
Patrik Stas: which might be actually better option.

177
00:24:26.140 --> 00:24:33.120
George Mulhearn: yeah, it's it's a good question about what would be the better option? Just because I I think unify, has

178
00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:38.100
George Mulhearn: so many great features like being able to automatically generate.

179
00:24:38.210 --> 00:24:42.259
George Mulhearn: you know, full struck types in swift and cotton.

180
00:24:43.910 --> 00:24:49.740
George Mulhearn: and things like that. You don't need to use handlers or things like that. You can just

181
00:24:49.850 --> 00:24:50.660
George Mulhearn: upset

182
00:24:52.350 --> 00:24:54.190
George Mulhearn: what's the cool features like that?

183
00:24:55.370 --> 00:25:00.929
Patrik Stas: This this might be interesting. I guess discussion point for

184
00:25:01.030 --> 00:25:03.629
Patrik Stas: maybe something to to

185
00:25:03.860 --> 00:25:09.549
Patrik Stas: just make sure he's aware of before he come in to the father. Wherever with certain approach

186
00:25:09.850 --> 00:25:16.929
Patrik Stas: as a I know we we in in in like no Js. The the no jazz wrapper we have

187
00:25:18.630 --> 00:25:22.890
Patrik Stas: It's been kind of built on top of handle, so it's hard to run away from me. Now

188
00:25:23.090 --> 00:25:24.870
Patrik Stas: we don't like huge

189
00:25:25.420 --> 00:25:28.509
Patrik Stas: huge reward of the thing.

190
00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:30.219
Patrik Stas: but yeah.

191
00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:38.010
Patrik Stas: maybe, since since this is UN, if I can, can actually generate structs and stuff like this

192
00:25:38.460 --> 00:25:41.150
Patrik Stas: might be better to actually start this

193
00:25:42.350 --> 00:25:44.319
Patrik Stas: on a. Is V. 6 itself.

194
00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:46.050
Patrik Stas: without the that

195
00:25:46.670 --> 00:25:50.769
Patrik Stas: being being and forced to work with the handles. But

196
00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:56.269
Patrik Stas: yeah, what's the next? Take on this, or if if he sees advantage

197
00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:59.499
Patrik Stas: going with the in his case.

198
00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:03.520
George Mulhearn: Yeah, I i'm not. I'm not too familiar with

199
00:26:03.630 --> 00:26:06.370
George Mulhearn: flutter to be honest.

200
00:26:07.580 --> 00:26:09.770
George Mulhearn: or what tools exist there.

201
00:26:11.020 --> 00:26:19.569
George Mulhearn: yeah. Another great part of unif is the the error handling, and how errors get past, you know, through the layer.

202
00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:23.370
George Mulhearn: yeah, it's pretty cool.

203
00:26:24.890 --> 00:26:27.130
Patrik Stas: Nice, nice.

204
00:26:28.330 --> 00:26:36.089
Patrik Stas: yeah. I would be definitely curious to to see that you need fine. Do you think you'd be like you? You You briefly

205
00:26:36.150 --> 00:26:38.969
Patrik Stas: touch touched on it before that?

206
00:26:39.430 --> 00:26:49.459
Patrik Stas: Do you think you'd be able to contribute some like short demo example, like for the actual approach. You know. How does it look like? If you build.

207
00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:51.689
Patrik Stas: you need 5

208
00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:56.579
Patrik Stas: kind of if you you know layer on top of a

209
00:26:57.360 --> 00:27:01.309
George Mulhearn: yeah, yeah, sure, I could try a a proof of concept demo

210
00:27:01.340 --> 00:27:06.359
Patrik Stas: branch. There will be interesting, maybe, for other people to, you know.

211
00:27:06.860 --> 00:27:10.629
Patrik Stas: to to to get in just for inspiration, I guess.

212
00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:18.080
Patrik Stas: But yeah, it's it's if you have resources and time, and if you can do it, it'll be great. That

213
00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:32.620
Patrik Stas: that's I. I'll I'll leave it at that. You know it's it's up to you, but it'll be for sure. Appreciate it now, looking into ahead in 2,023 outlook. so

214
00:27:33.140 --> 00:27:44.139
Patrik Stas: it should be in the the 2,003, I believe, should be in the team of fortification, and just further modularizing and decoupling stuff across the board.

215
00:27:45.510 --> 00:27:49.200
Patrik Stas: and my suggestion here in this issue.

216
00:27:49.260 --> 00:27:53.209
Patrik Stas: also to kind of start this

217
00:27:55.290 --> 00:27:57.390
Patrik Stas: start this

218
00:27:58.850 --> 00:28:00.460
Patrik Stas: gratification.

219
00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:02.110
Patrik Stas: with

220
00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:21.689
Patrik Stas: Who? The message is great just by starting publishing it on a crates. I/O, and I believe this should like drive, drive us to improve the documentation for the create, and also to think more about the Apis like which basis of the create should be actually public.

221
00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:23.940
Patrik Stas: and which should be private.

222
00:28:24.070 --> 00:28:29.970
Patrik Stas: which so far I think we are. We we haven't put so much

223
00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:32.660
Patrik Stas: energy effort into this.

224
00:28:32.740 --> 00:28:40.819
Patrik Stas: And many things are public just because it's convenient. But perhaps not. Everything should be really published out of the freight.

225
00:28:41.150 --> 00:28:50.460
Patrik Stas: And so yeah, I think this this will kind of drive us to to think about. These things bit harder and do things better at the higher quality.

226
00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:55.200
Patrik Stas: and the idea is to start with the messages to kind of learn the

227
00:28:55.780 --> 00:28:59.950
Patrik Stas: to explore the boilerplate, how to actually publish

228
00:29:00.190 --> 00:29:17.709
Patrik Stas: the how to actually publish it from the from the Ci, and how to approach the versioning. Should the messages and the other creates be kind of kept at the same version? Or shall we just start versioning everything separately, you know. Questions like that. Things like that.

229
00:29:20.820 --> 00:29:27.230
Patrik Stas: And I think, yeah, this can be applied. And further to the other

230
00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:32.539
Patrik Stas: crates and modules in the in the current code base as well.

231
00:29:34.550 --> 00:29:36.130
Patrik Stas: I already closed it.

232
00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:45.690
Patrik Stas: we we can do the same thing, for like they do, they do create and video resolver create. Once we implement that

233
00:29:45.800 --> 00:30:03.990
Patrik Stas: or the Protocols grades. And I I imagine this could be like, separate, you know, really kind of individual, well documented, creates on a crates I all people could use and build upon, and and perhaps, you know, contribute into these crates without necessarily

234
00:30:04.780 --> 00:30:09.290
Patrik Stas: dealing with working with as V. 6 itself.

235
00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:16.480
Patrik Stas: The the main a is V. 6, but perhaps we can. We can gain more traction. These, like lower level

236
00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:24.669
Patrik Stas: components which could be shared by other projects which wants to deal with the Aries in in the rest as well.

237
00:30:26.350 --> 00:30:29.520
so trying to find, like a discount.

238
00:30:30.150 --> 00:30:32.300
Patrik Stas: shared the denominator

239
00:30:32.370 --> 00:30:36.520
Patrik Stas: for for different projects.

240
00:30:36.620 --> 00:30:41.410
Patrik Stas: which which you might not be necessarily Irish. Vcx projects.

241
00:30:42.810 --> 00:30:57.490
Patrik Stas: then, the next point here. with I was thinking about this, which I find important, although we just like currently one issue on our repo who is implementing video resolver.

242
00:30:59.350 --> 00:31:05.259
Patrik Stas: and just just generally drive the code base more about Ddos as they are.

243
00:31:05.730 --> 00:31:11.379
Patrik Stas: This I I believe they should be kind of first class citizen in the cold base. And

244
00:31:11.810 --> 00:31:14.689
Patrik Stas: And yeah, I mean it's it's shared

245
00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:24.429
Patrik Stas: kind of data structure across the ledgers. So if you want to be ledger agnostic, which going forward long term, we definitely want to be.

246
00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:31.489
Patrik Stas: Then we should definitely think more in terms of the Id documents.

247
00:31:32.790 --> 00:31:40.510
Patrik Stas: and this is a yeah issue which is briefly describing some issues and things we should think about, and

248
00:31:41.260 --> 00:31:52.569
Patrik Stas: probably can get started with a bit soft in the methods soon, I suppose, During the 2,023. There they did in the met that

249
00:31:52.690 --> 00:31:56.790
Patrik Stas: be supported by in the ledgers.

250
00:31:57.070 --> 00:31:58.580
Patrik Stas: And

251
00:31:59.130 --> 00:32:07.340
Patrik Stas: and also I believe vdr tools itself, not no video tools in the Vdr itself.

252
00:32:07.390 --> 00:32:11.729
Patrik Stas: so we can. We can perhaps implement this as well. And then

253
00:32:13.670 --> 00:32:21.300
Patrik Stas: as a sort of experimental feature, we could perhaps try to harness the the Uni resolver

254
00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:24.250
Patrik Stas: as a way of

255
00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:30.190
Patrik Stas: resolving videos all those. Obviously, this is relying on the third party

256
00:32:30.350 --> 00:32:33.029
Patrik Stas: for the resolution which is not ideal.

257
00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:33.970
Patrik Stas: and

258
00:32:34.010 --> 00:32:44.490
Patrik Stas: it just nicer when when the users can resolve the deals like natively and so sovereign manner without a trusted party.

259
00:32:45.650 --> 00:32:58.400
Patrik Stas: but yeah, the nice nice thing about this obviously would be. Then suddenly we could resolve like videos videos across the board, across all the ledgers. Bit criterion, you know,

260
00:32:58.580 --> 00:33:04.059
Patrik Stas: all, all of those tens of different did matters which exist today

261
00:33:04.390 --> 00:33:08.650
Patrik Stas: not only like your but yeah, just just pretty much everything

262
00:33:14.100 --> 00:33:26.410
Patrik Stas: moving to the next point, I think also important achievement, for the 2,023 would be finishing the migration to to credit libraries.

263
00:33:26.450 --> 00:33:27.749
Patrik Stas: I think we have like.

264
00:33:28.670 --> 00:33:36.960
Patrik Stas: I mean that we are definitely like in Midway, or perhaps perhaps by midway to accomplish this.

265
00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:43.859
Patrik Stas: as we have the holder and the we are part pretty much done.

266
00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:45.059
Patrik Stas: But

267
00:33:45.930 --> 00:33:50.739
Patrik Stas: Well, actually, even the verifier seems to be quite quite easy.

268
00:33:50.810 --> 00:33:51.760
Patrik Stas: And

269
00:33:52.050 --> 00:33:56.229
Patrik Stas: now it's a matter of finishing off the word with the issuer.

270
00:33:56.520 --> 00:34:01.180
Patrik Stas: which might be more challenging in terms of implementation. But then also the

271
00:34:01.660 --> 00:34:05.020
Patrik Stas: the migration from the old

272
00:34:07.620 --> 00:34:11.260
Patrik Stas: from the old Vdr. Tools

273
00:34:11.500 --> 00:34:14.090
Patrik Stas: to the credits libraries

274
00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:18.009
Patrik Stas: not sure what this is, gonna

275
00:34:18.130 --> 00:34:20.610
Patrik Stas: what what it's gonna take. But

276
00:34:21.739 --> 00:34:27.660
Patrik Stas: definitely it's important for us to enable the issue who started

277
00:34:27.739 --> 00:34:28.979
Patrik Stas: on the

278
00:34:29.310 --> 00:34:30.709
Patrik Stas: Vv. Our tools

279
00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:36.439
Patrik Stas: should continue operations with critics credit libraries, and

280
00:34:36.900 --> 00:34:42.680
Patrik Stas: I don't know. I guess it depends how things are being stored in the wallet, and things like that.

281
00:34:43.449 --> 00:34:55.710
Patrik Stas: I'm. Not really sure exactly what this challenges are, but the the the the data structures in the wall, it should somehow stay intact. So switching to the credits, libraries should

282
00:34:56.210 --> 00:34:59.090
Patrik Stas: should be somehow possible for the yours.

283
00:35:01.820 --> 00:35:05.490
Patrik Stas: Then yeah, Well, once we are, I guess. Once we are done with this.

284
00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:08.520
Patrik Stas: we can.

285
00:35:08.680 --> 00:35:14.310
Patrik Stas: we can focus. We can continue focusing on the areas as car support

286
00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:20.369
Patrik Stas: which is now challenging because of some conflicting dependencies between the critics

287
00:35:20.390 --> 00:35:24.660
Patrik Stas: and in the media and the Vdr Tools Library

288
00:35:26.710 --> 00:35:30.969
Patrik Stas: So we will. We'll see how I guess how this goes, and then we'll

289
00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:35.020
Patrik Stas: we'll continue looking at

290
00:35:35.170 --> 00:35:41.010
Patrik Stas: what it takes to to move on to Aries as car wallet

291
00:35:43.310 --> 00:35:52.180
Patrik Stas: so actually, maybe I can edit here. I think it's good important point, and it should deserve it. It deserves to be on the list.

292
00:35:52.550 --> 00:35:54.830
Patrik Stas: I guess I think

293
00:35:55.700 --> 00:35:58.679
Patrik Stas: I think support

294
00:35:59.380 --> 00:36:01.180
Patrik Stas: and it's for

295
00:36:01.620 --> 00:36:05.209
Patrik Stas: for Aries as well. That's

296
00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:07.490
Patrik Stas: and I guess

297
00:36:09.890 --> 00:36:15.169
Patrik Stas: Products library libraries on the issue of boss

298
00:36:15.610 --> 00:36:17.009
Patrik Stas: very far.

299
00:36:18.120 --> 00:36:22.850
Patrik Stas: and while it there should be some enable enable migration

300
00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:25.770
Patrik Stas: of Vdr to

301
00:36:25.890 --> 00:36:28.060
Patrik Stas: you, sure

302
00:36:28.490 --> 00:36:32.120
Patrik Stas: to become a critics issue.

303
00:36:33.650 --> 00:36:35.790
Patrik Stas: I'll save it like this.

304
00:36:40.500 --> 00:36:49.749
Patrik Stas: yeah. Then then there's again a bit a generic point here for 23. But just generally you want to improve the code quality getting

305
00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:59.090
Patrik Stas: there's still space for improvements in terms of like utilizing, you know, being more trade focused

306
00:36:59.290 --> 00:37:03.959
Patrik Stas: do more typing. There's okay. There's number of

307
00:37:04.470 --> 00:37:05.299
Patrik Stas: the

308
00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:17.409
Patrik Stas: cases across the board in the code base where we're passing strings where actually we could, whereas we know it's particular type of string. For example.

309
00:37:17.690 --> 00:37:23.820
Patrik Stas: at the Id there's places in the code base we are passing the Id as a string. But

310
00:37:25.270 --> 00:37:41.649
Patrik Stas: It will be just much safer to work with the the code base if we had some sort of type for the did itself, whether it's just like alias, or it's actually something more in the end, which can, like cereals, serialize the

311
00:37:43.930 --> 00:37:45.160
Patrik Stas: stuff like that.

312
00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:49.440
Patrik Stas: And and this could be applied for not only the Ids, but also like

313
00:37:49.630 --> 00:37:53.649
Patrik Stas: keys, public keys and

314
00:37:53.710 --> 00:37:55.890
Patrik Stas: perhaps Urls

315
00:37:56.660 --> 00:37:57.979
Patrik Stas: might be more.

316
00:37:58.470 --> 00:38:05.659
Patrik Stas: And then and then, lastly, also. Importantly, I would like to speed up the test execution.

317
00:38:05.750 --> 00:38:10.230
Patrik Stas: just like a recently, I think a month or 2 ago I was mentioning

318
00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:15.270
Patrik Stas: the improvement, like multi

319
00:38:15.290 --> 00:38:20.579
Patrik Stas: like magnitude, order of magnitude, improvement in

320
00:38:20.740 --> 00:38:39.110
Patrik Stas: in execution of some particular test, where we, where we removed the Mediator Agency, and and instead started using sort of in memory channels instead for that, for the communication between 2 parties in the test

321
00:38:39.150 --> 00:38:42.720
Patrik Stas: which which led to a really huge

322
00:38:43.880 --> 00:38:46.100
Patrik Stas: test execution, improvement.

323
00:38:46.630 --> 00:38:58.030
Patrik Stas: and it would like to, you know, driving. Continue driving this for further on the more test, and just make the integration test really as fast as possible.

324
00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:10.430
Patrik Stas: and it's kind of like closed loop, I guess you know. Then the more we improve on the code quality and the test execution

325
00:39:10.780 --> 00:39:18.800
Patrik Stas: the easier it's going to be it's gonna work on the next point right here the common thing engagement.

326
00:39:18.970 --> 00:39:25.020
Patrik Stas: if the if that if the code is better, easier to read safer, easier to contribute

327
00:39:25.310 --> 00:39:34.010
Patrik Stas: it. It tests easier and faster. It's also easier to gain more traction with the potential contributors.

328
00:39:34.020 --> 00:39:45.459
Patrik Stas: as it's easier for them to to get started, and and that's something I will still like us to to improve. There's definitely gaps in the documentation right. Now.

329
00:39:46.660 --> 00:39:49.420
Patrik Stas: it's just how to get started.

330
00:39:49.700 --> 00:39:55.860
Patrik Stas: And but also more in terms of more technical documentation. Is

331
00:39:56.080 --> 00:39:59.860
Patrik Stas: as there's not really any like

332
00:40:00.570 --> 00:40:15.419
Patrik Stas: Ward. Word documentation on the area's Dcx level. There's a document all the documentation on the live B cx layer, which, however, might be even per

333
00:40:15.850 --> 00:40:18.959
Patrik Stas: outdated and in some cases.

334
00:40:19.570 --> 00:40:33.889
Patrik Stas: but yeah, I would like to just mainly focus on the aeries Vcx As a crate and as a as as an and it's individual sub modules and sub-

335
00:40:33.930 --> 00:40:46.820
Patrik Stas: and focus on getting that as a core core piece of the whole project getting getting to the best possible shape with a nice documentation.

336
00:40:47.130 --> 00:41:00.349
Patrik Stas: and making it easy easier for people to get started. So these also ties to to the agency. We are the the Mediator Agency. We are removing now as a

337
00:41:00.590 --> 00:41:04.829
Patrik Stas: because right now you it just it's it's being

338
00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:07.489
Patrik Stas: an extra barrier to get started.

339
00:41:07.810 --> 00:41:11.650
Patrik Stas: so we would just like to have some

340
00:41:11.740 --> 00:41:20.560
Patrik Stas: really simple, ideally some simple example built on top of Eric's Dcx code somewhere on the main rhythmic page, where

341
00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:22.240
Patrik Stas: you would see like

342
00:41:22.990 --> 00:41:24.129
Patrik Stas: how to

343
00:41:24.320 --> 00:41:26.990
Patrik Stas: how to do something you know how to send.

344
00:41:27.170 --> 00:41:42.630
Patrik Stas: let's say a did come message over over using ours, Vcx. Or maybe issue credential or something like that, just like really short, concise demonstration of ours. V. 6 Api. Which will be able to run

345
00:41:43.650 --> 00:41:46.770
locally without much obstructions

346
00:41:47.170 --> 00:41:49.600
Patrik Stas: and much pre requirements.

347
00:41:50.320 --> 00:42:00.529
Patrik Stas: I think this has like improved a lot in 2,022 actually where we're originally.

348
00:42:00.550 --> 00:42:02.740
Patrik Stas: you had to

349
00:42:02.990 --> 00:42:05.120
Patrik Stas: bills.

350
00:42:05.300 --> 00:42:09.330
Patrik Stas: Vdr: tools slightly bindi first.

351
00:42:09.550 --> 00:42:15.240
Patrik Stas: and set it up into your like system path. And then you had to build

352
00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:34.830
Patrik Stas: the live Vcx, and and it just had this kind of indirect dependency. It's runtime dependency, and this has been removed that the like towards the end of 2,022, where right now we can run cargo, build in Ariz, Vcx, and then just build all the dependencies.

353
00:42:34.900 --> 00:42:47.879
Patrik Stas: so it's it's simply batteries included, and you don't really have to go ahead and and pre build Vvr tools manually, or something like that. But yeah, there's still ways to, I think.

354
00:42:47.980 --> 00:42:50.579
Patrik Stas: Make Make it easier for people

355
00:42:50.610 --> 00:42:55.279
Patrik Stas: to get started. And yeah, I guess this is related.

356
00:42:55.460 --> 00:42:59.869
Patrik Stas: It'll be. It'll be great to see more

357
00:43:00.020 --> 00:43:02.229
Patrik Stas: project examples.

358
00:43:02.750 --> 00:43:08.840
Patrik Stas: whether it's like as a 5 repairs or agents, or

359
00:43:08.940 --> 00:43:13.090
Patrik Stas: it's pretty much anything, and I guess at this point we have.

360
00:43:13.670 --> 00:43:17.199
Patrik Stas: Well, we we could say that we have a few of them right now.

361
00:43:17.420 --> 00:43:23.530
Patrik Stas: I mean counting Lib. Dcx is one of the craze being built of a a. Is V. 6, that's one.

362
00:43:23.570 --> 00:43:26.780
Patrik Stas: But then, for further, we have.

363
00:43:26.910 --> 00:43:29.530
Patrik Stas: and now we have rust agent.

364
00:43:29.670 --> 00:43:31.109
Patrik Stas: we just

365
00:43:31.240 --> 00:43:36.320
Patrik Stas: build directly on top of a

366
00:43:36.640 --> 00:43:39.060
Patrik Stas: Then we also have

367
00:43:39.560 --> 00:43:48.119
Patrik Stas: right now, just as a pull request. But we have a further iteration. On on top of that we have a cli

368
00:43:48.290 --> 00:43:50.060
Patrik Stas: program.

369
00:43:50.380 --> 00:44:03.139
Patrik Stas: a build on. These Ares v. 6 Rust agent, which which lets you to to perform basic operations from Cli using a

370
00:44:04.900 --> 00:44:07.450
Patrik Stas: and then you know,

371
00:44:08.240 --> 00:44:13.010
Patrik Stas: this flatter wrapper from from

372
00:44:13.060 --> 00:44:18.129
Patrik Stas: or perhaps if you, George contribute some unifi

373
00:44:18.150 --> 00:44:27.880
Patrik Stas: example that would be awesome or actually just like, I would love to see any kind of projects built of what build on areas Vc. Eggs.

374
00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:37.779
Patrik Stas: Perhaps that kind of like side project I have personally in mind. Are we building my theater with which is now

375
00:44:38.180 --> 00:44:42.620
Patrik Stas: again, thanks to the dec decoupling from the

376
00:44:42.910 --> 00:44:47.109
Patrik Stas: the Pcx Agency Mediator. Now it's possible because

377
00:44:47.370 --> 00:44:51.489
Patrik Stas: you can use you can use as connections

378
00:44:52.200 --> 00:45:01.149
Patrik Stas: without mediation, which, in fact enables you to build a mediator on top of.

379
00:45:01.210 --> 00:45:06.979
Patrik Stas: So that's it's kind of a project which would be cool to see as Ross is super fast and

380
00:45:07.020 --> 00:45:15.500
Patrik Stas: and and and mid mediator is kind of like a middle middle middleware type of project, and I feel like a rust is really

381
00:45:15.630 --> 00:45:19.569
Patrik Stas: a good candidate for for this kind of implementation.

382
00:45:23.140 --> 00:45:28.290
Patrik Stas: yeah, and then and then finishing off this list.

383
00:45:28.780 --> 00:45:39.650
Patrik Stas: obviously will be nice to I had a new protocol support, I think, namely, and and most importantly, the did exchange protocol

384
00:45:41.370 --> 00:45:45.049
Patrik Stas: probably a a probably update support for the

385
00:45:45.710 --> 00:45:57.650
Patrik Stas: the new versions need newer versions of the issuance and verification proved verification protocols, which should be fairly low. Hanging fruit, I imagine.

386
00:45:57.710 --> 00:46:00.450
Patrik Stas: Nevertheless, it's still some work which is.

387
00:46:00.470 --> 00:46:02.189
Patrik Stas: I have to be done.

388
00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:03.490
Patrik Stas: And

389
00:46:03.890 --> 00:46:09.080
Patrik Stas: so yeah, that's something to look out for. 2,023. Hopefully, we'll get that done.

390
00:46:09.210 --> 00:46:11.270
Patrik Stas: and then

391
00:46:11.520 --> 00:46:24.130
Patrik Stas: I think it will be also great to to dig into the discom 2 point of exploration. Although this might be a bit more disruptive work, I assume

392
00:46:24.870 --> 00:46:29.860
Patrik Stas: I Haven't explored it to 2 point on the match yet.

393
00:46:29.960 --> 00:46:44.390
Patrik Stas: But there's I know that there's number of differences, and i'm not sure exactly what what impacts Won't. What impact this is going to have on the is V. 6 code base. But I don't think it should be significant, because

394
00:46:44.520 --> 00:46:46.369
Patrik Stas: did come is really just a

395
00:46:47.030 --> 00:46:48.970
Patrik Stas: the Communication exchange.

396
00:46:49.140 --> 00:47:07.350
Patrik Stas: and it does it. It shouldn't really impact the other areas protocols which work over did call so, whether it's whether it's, Ehr or presentation protocol, they are pretty much agnostic as to what kind of channel has been used to

397
00:47:07.390 --> 00:47:08.990
Patrik Stas: exchanging messages.

398
00:47:09.210 --> 00:47:10.919
Patrik Stas: so

399
00:47:11.230 --> 00:47:13.539
Patrik Stas: possibly this gonna have, like

400
00:47:13.680 --> 00:47:19.100
Patrik Stas: disrupt the connection, or did exchange type of protocols

401
00:47:19.150 --> 00:47:21.570
Patrik Stas: somewhat. I'm not sure.

402
00:47:21.930 --> 00:47:26.530
Patrik Stas: but I think even if we i'm not sure if we gonna

403
00:47:26.790 --> 00:47:37.270
Patrik Stas: fully Blumen did come to point out this year. But it'll be, and definitely nice to at least get a clear picture on what to expect from it, and

404
00:47:37.700 --> 00:47:47.380
Patrik Stas: what's what it's gonna look like. Once we start implanting it just to kind of get that better vision of yeah, what? What? What is gonna bring

405
00:47:51.530 --> 00:47:59.500
George Mulhearn: So I was gonna say, yeah, I think I I think, occupy have some maybe all of did come v 2

406
00:47:59.540 --> 00:48:06.720
George Mulhearn: implemented in that code base. I'm not sure if they use it. But there's definitely those files set up to

407
00:48:06.880 --> 00:48:12.019
George Mulhearn: you know. Pack and unpack. V. 2 messages using ascar.

408
00:48:12.240 --> 00:48:16.289
George Mulhearn: I'm not too sure if it's possible to do it

409
00:48:16.650 --> 00:48:18.869
George Mulhearn: using live Indie

410
00:48:19.400 --> 00:48:22.770
George Mulhearn: just because Libby and the only has the pack and on pack

411
00:48:22.950 --> 00:48:35.989
Patrik Stas: methods, you know. Yeah, yeah, right? And also I think there's there's like there's other differences other than encryption, I think, like you actually specify transports

412
00:48:36.030 --> 00:48:50.639
Patrik Stas: in those messages you are sending directly, so as I, as as far as I heard, basically did come to point out, kind of eliminates the need for the for the connection and the Exchange protocol

413
00:48:50.720 --> 00:49:04.350
Patrik Stas: to some degree. I'm not sure. I'm not really sure. Maybe i'm not sure if i'm correct here. But that's full. I remember there's this nice website, I think, where which is describes the differences.

414
00:49:04.470 --> 00:49:06.219
Patrik Stas: did come

415
00:49:06.450 --> 00:49:07.599
Patrik Stas: me too.

416
00:49:08.770 --> 00:49:12.029
Patrik Stas: this is this guidebook, I guess.

417
00:49:21.530 --> 00:49:26.809
Patrik Stas: Well, I know why it's so slow. No, this is not exactly what I was looking for.

418
00:49:28.520 --> 00:49:31.230
Patrik Stas: yeah, no, no, it was different. What?

419
00:49:31.430 --> 00:49:38.590
Patrik Stas: What's new or something like that? What's new in that come to? So this. This describes it but nicely, and there's

420
00:49:38.650 --> 00:49:57.530
Patrik Stas: few main points here. But I guess let's not get into technicalities here too deeply. We can maybe. yeah, set up some meeting, some, some some of the weekly calls to kind of look through it that directly, in like a kind of workshopy, collaborative way, and just

421
00:49:57.980 --> 00:49:59.720
Patrik Stas: i'll learn together about

422
00:49:59.810 --> 00:50:01.749
Patrik Stas: how to implement it. Come to.

423
00:50:01.970 --> 00:50:06.180
Patrik Stas: into an into how to integrate it into in the

424
00:50:08.680 --> 00:50:15.330
Patrik Stas: yeah, i'm not sure. What did I what I meant with this last point? Maybe I used to

425
00:50:15.680 --> 00:50:18.059
Patrik Stas: right something more, and then I didn't

426
00:50:18.170 --> 00:50:18.979
Patrik Stas: so.

427
00:50:19.150 --> 00:50:22.749
Patrik Stas: I think i'll just delete this off. I think it's an error.

428
00:50:24.010 --> 00:50:28.209
Patrik Stas: And yeah, that brings us to the end of the list.

429
00:50:32.550 --> 00:50:34.730
Patrik Stas: So yeah, that's

430
00:50:34.760 --> 00:50:36.309
Patrik Stas: that's it. So we have

431
00:50:36.710 --> 00:50:43.539
Patrik Stas: also work to do in 2,003, and it's really exciting to see more people coming on board, which

432
00:50:43.720 --> 00:50:53.129
Patrik Stas: makes me more confident about the all this stuff actually getting done as opposed to a big portion of

433
00:50:53.730 --> 00:51:09.620
Patrik Stas: like pre 2,000 to 2,022 and pre 2,022 we we didn't have such a come into focus. And there was less people always the less people coming in and and contributing

434
00:51:10.030 --> 00:51:10.970
Patrik Stas: So

435
00:51:11.220 --> 00:51:14.470
Patrik Stas: yeah, it's, it's it's exciting to see

436
00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:17.540
Patrik Stas: new people joining in and

437
00:51:17.750 --> 00:51:20.229
Patrik Stas: having really nice contributions.

438
00:51:22.280 --> 00:51:24.779
George Mulhearn: It's a great list. It's very exciting.

439
00:51:25.120 --> 00:51:26.510
George Mulhearn: Thanks for putting it together.

440
00:51:26.670 --> 00:51:28.149
Patrik Stas: Yeah, yeah, awesome.

441
00:51:28.780 --> 00:51:33.640
Patrik Stas: I don't know. Do you have anything, any, any any thoughts, or

442
00:51:34.560 --> 00:51:41.349
Patrik Stas: whether it's on 20, maybe 2023 kind of plan or anything else you would like to see

443
00:51:48.040 --> 00:51:50.870
George Mulhearn: I think I think we covered it all really.

444
00:51:51.590 --> 00:51:52.350
George Mulhearn: I think.

445
00:51:53.040 --> 00:51:55.089
George Mulhearn: Personally, the protocol stuff.

446
00:51:55.620 --> 00:51:58.529
George Mulhearn: I think, will be pretty exciting. and also

447
00:51:58.950 --> 00:52:02.439
George Mulhearn: turning Aries Vcx into its iron crate.

448
00:52:02.690 --> 00:52:06.300
George Mulhearn: that that can be published.

449
00:52:06.580 --> 00:52:08.129
George Mulhearn: you know, To create tire

450
00:52:08.220 --> 00:52:12.639
George Mulhearn: will be a a cool journey, I think.

451
00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:13.799
Patrik Stas: Hmm.

452
00:52:14.230 --> 00:52:16.740
George Mulhearn: Yeah. Just because, you know, they'll be

453
00:52:17.270 --> 00:52:25.369
George Mulhearn: a few hurdles, I think, like, I I think, to get things published on crates. I you can't have any get dependencies and things like that.

454
00:52:27.860 --> 00:52:30.149
George Mulhearn: So then, you know, we might have to

455
00:52:30.390 --> 00:52:35.860
George Mulhearn: publish the fork of video tools on creates I as well, or something like that. And

456
00:52:35.980 --> 00:52:38.189
George Mulhearn: Yeah. Oh, okay, I see

457
00:52:38.560 --> 00:52:42.820
Patrik Stas: right right then. We are using now those good dependencies a bit.

458
00:52:45.830 --> 00:52:52.600
Patrik Stas: Yeah, I guess we'll. We'll have to cross some cross, some gaps, some.

459
00:52:53.340 --> 00:52:54.680
Patrik Stas: But

460
00:52:54.750 --> 00:53:07.260
Patrik Stas: I think if we start actually, we'd like those lower lever like, I guess, publishing as a create might be a bit challenging in in in exactly these terms as you describe. But

461
00:53:07.370 --> 00:53:14.400
Patrik Stas: then, if we start with like those smaller crates, and those sub sub-crates

462
00:53:14.610 --> 00:53:20.030
Patrik Stas: might be actually easier than because they themselves have very few dependencies Like when you think

463
00:53:20.110 --> 00:53:21.310
Patrik Stas: about the

464
00:53:21.510 --> 00:53:24.229
Patrik Stas: the the messages, or did Chrome Cr. Or

465
00:53:24.260 --> 00:53:25.870
Patrik Stas: perhaps in the

466
00:53:26.120 --> 00:53:27.410
Patrik Stas: for the calls

467
00:53:27.470 --> 00:53:31.680
Patrik Stas: great. Once we extract it, those should be fairly simple ones.

468
00:53:31.890 --> 00:53:32.729
Patrik Stas: so

469
00:53:33.490 --> 00:53:34.529
Patrik Stas: so

470
00:53:35.350 --> 00:53:42.269
Patrik Stas: I guess maybe not not so difficult there. But they're not. Once, once they move up the stack, then

471
00:53:42.580 --> 00:53:54.680
Patrik Stas: maybe we'll we'll get a few more challenges, but in the end I guess you know I I I guess it's still just driving it. It might be challenges, but it's really just driving us

472
00:53:54.920 --> 00:53:57.290
Patrik Stas: to the that right. Directions, I mean

473
00:53:58.420 --> 00:54:09.080
Patrik Stas: project sounds definitely Sounds more sounds to be more mature if it doesn't have get the dependencies right? If it actually depends on the other trades which are

474
00:54:09.110 --> 00:54:10.589
Patrik Stas: properly published.

475
00:54:11.040 --> 00:54:13.489
George Mulhearn: So yeah, exactly, yeah.

476
00:54:13.860 --> 00:54:17.459
Patrik Stas: yeah, just it's remove removing the

477
00:54:18.170 --> 00:54:22.770
removing, drive us to remove the cold smells and

478
00:54:23.010 --> 00:54:24.189
Patrik Stas: and

479
00:54:25.740 --> 00:54:27.469
Patrik Stas: improve the recommendation.

480
00:54:27.640 --> 00:54:33.640
Patrik Stas: The Apis. I think it's gonna be it's gonna have a nice second order effects

481
00:54:34.450 --> 00:54:37.020
Patrik Stas: the the publishing itself

482
00:54:38.820 --> 00:54:49.410
Patrik Stas: any I would be, I would be really excited, I guess, for 2,023 if if we publish some of these crates like not Aries Vcx. But let's say Aries messages.

483
00:54:49.640 --> 00:54:57.679
Patrik Stas: and it will be exciting to see someone else building different projects, maybe different, every implementation whatever.

484
00:54:58.100 --> 00:55:08.030
Patrik Stas: but actually somebody utilizing those, you know, sub crates for themselves and and and having contributors who are interested in.

485
00:55:08.320 --> 00:55:11.610
Patrik Stas: I don't know did come, or did resolver create?

486
00:55:11.730 --> 00:55:15.300
Patrik Stas: But not necessarily Aries dcx great, and then

487
00:55:15.400 --> 00:55:21.009
Patrik Stas: start start working on those the the shared pieces together.

488
00:55:22.330 --> 00:55:24.300
Patrik Stas: That will be really cool to see.

489
00:55:31.700 --> 00:55:37.779
Patrik Stas: All right. yeah, we we spend almost 1 h going through this list.

490
00:55:39.700 --> 00:55:42.899
Patrik Stas: so it's it's pretty much, and

491
00:55:44.130 --> 00:55:45.970
Patrik Stas: and time to wrap it up.

492
00:55:46.130 --> 00:55:52.499
Patrik Stas: I guess that being said, yeah, this is the first time we are speaking, George, this year, Isn't it?

493
00:55:53.580 --> 00:55:57.799
George Mulhearn: Yeah, a New year.

494
00:56:02.340 --> 00:56:08.830
Patrik Stas: Yeah. I also also have been here to yeah, anyone who who who tune in today.

495
00:56:10.230 --> 00:56:11.979
Patrik Stas: again

496
00:56:12.460 --> 00:56:16.880
Patrik Stas: anybody who is listening. we are very much

497

00:56:39.790 --> 00:56:49.490
Patrik Stas: Yeah. So feel free to join. Thanks for listening. Thank you, George, for being partner. My partner here discussing the the library outlook

502
00:56:49.690 --> 00:56:58.369
Patrik Stas: and the reviewing it's it's much easier to to talk when when there's somebody somebody to talk to. Actually.

503
00:56:58.540 --> 00:57:01.950
Patrik Stas: So. Yeah, thank you very much for your time.
