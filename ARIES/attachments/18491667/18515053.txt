16:48:35	 From BizSecure : Hello we are new to the meetings, our team is looking to assist any way we can. 


Our team is currently looking to enhance our product with the current release however we have struggled to find documentation especially related to webhooks. 

Any advice on a forum or an environment to chat with fellow developers would be greatly appreciated. 

Kind regards 

Alfonso
