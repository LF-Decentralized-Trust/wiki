1
00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.580
Timo Glastra: Good afternoon. And from

2
00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:33.880
Charles Lanahan: afternoon or morning.

3
00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:42.700
Timo Glastra: yeah, morning or evening, or whatever where you are located, where we are

4
00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.609
Charles Lanahan: is that is the area's framework.

5
00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:20.720
Charles Lanahan: setting up an agent initiating credentials. Is that done by indigo? Or is that someone else?

6
00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:24.570
Charles Lanahan: The thing that's happening next week?

7
00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.670
Timo Glastra: You mean the the workshop.

8
00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:29.800
Charles Lanahan: Yeah, yeah.

9
00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:40.710
Timo Glastra: it's done by Ariel Kareem and Baron. So 2 from us with animal, and then aerial.

10
00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.050
Timo Glastra: also, it does it?

11
00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:44.330
Charles Lanahan: Oh, cool.

12
00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:53.980
Timo Glastra: Yeah, I certainly won't be able to attend. because I'm on vacation next week. but I think.

13
00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:59.420
Timo Glastra: yeah, with parents, cream and area. All their work should be in good hands.

14
00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:12.740
Timo Glastra:  all right. I think we can get started.

15
00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:16.919
Timo Glastra: this meeting recording it is

16
00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:21.680
Timo Glastra:  all right. So.

17
00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:26.459
Timo Glastra: But I've run to the aristocratic group call of July

18
00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:36.869
Timo Glastra: 6, yeah. And I need to RAM you to bite. But I, which go to concert and any trust policy. Like to add yourself to the tennis list. Feel free

19
00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:39.290
Timo Glastra: to do so.

20
00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:41.699
Timo Glastra: I posted a link in the chat.

21
00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:47.080
Timo Glastra:  Anyone new here that would like to introduce himself.

22
00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:58.029
Timo Glastra: It works nice, I think. yeah.

23
00:04:58.710 --> 00:04:59.560
Timo Glastra: okay.

24
00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:21.670
Timo Glastra:  So for today, I don't have a lot on the agenda. so we can see if there's issues or Pr or things people would like to discuss. And otherwise we can keep it short today. I think it's also moreification period. And yeah, it's been less

25
00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:28.130
Timo Glastra: going on at last week. But I know I saw some work on the did comfy 2 stuff, and Ariel has

26
00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:35.470
Timo Glastra: left a lot of comments on issues and stuff. So maybe we can cover some of those.

27
00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:40.429
Timo Glastra: are there any status Updates? What's the by with the call this week.

28
00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:50.020
Clecio Varjao: yes.

29
00:05:53.850 --> 00:06:00.280
Clecio Varjao: we didn't have a lot of new things, but a couple of things that I will mention is

30
00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:14.779
Clecio Varjao: we're making some changes to the scanning flow, and there's some conversations around go codes. and I don't know if there's a potential opportunity for some of those go codes. Logic move to Aj.

31
00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:24.159
Clecio Varjao: we are introducing the Id or the new concept of a femoral connections or A.

32
00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:34.800
Clecio Varjao: It gets deleted when a transaction or operation is completed. the main driving force for that is the

33
00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:42.140
Clecio Varjao: here code density make. That is smaller. when you when we're using connectionless for request.

34
00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:55.740
Clecio Varjao:  and I also to the areas community called. There was some code about some talk about the

35
00:06:56.850 --> 00:07:01.320
Clecio Varjao: here, did upgrade to the did come.

36
00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:10.890
Clecio Varjao: You did 52 of it 3 I've added an issue to Aires Framework Transcript. I feel like the

37
00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:22.870
Clecio Varjao: they wanted the framework to to implement those upgrades, and that about a kind of a a month framework timeframe. But they were asking, What is the timeframe possible?

38
00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:31.779
Ariel Gentile: And we say, one on mo a month. We were not sure. But but yeah, I think it's

39
00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:41.009
Ariel Gentile: if I'm not wrong, it's it should not be so complicated to add it this to if she right him. What do you? What do you think?

40
00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:48.849
Clecio Varjao: I yeah, I just created that you should there. So don't forget. But yeah, there's not a lot of details. So, but

41
00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:51.890
Clecio Varjao: who understands more than me, please update

42
00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:59.250
Timo Glastra: cool. yeah, is, is, is anyone willing to pick this up in the coming months.

43
00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:06.800
Ariel Gentile: Yeah, maybe maybe I can. I can do it. But I I I will have to study a little bit how it works. Huh?

44
00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:09.030
Timo Glastra: Yeah. The way, yeah.

45
00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:12.760
Timo Glastra: I can help you

46
00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:19.560
Timo Glastra: with the implementation or like, guide you. if you have questions cool. Okay?

47
00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:27.060
Timo Glastra:  yeah. And

48
00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:36.740
Timo Glastra: for the a thermal connection like, make your code smaller if you considered using shortened urls.

49
00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:42.699
Clecio Varjao: yes, we do not want to use. Certainly. URL service for

50
00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:56.999
Clecio Varjao: There is a possibility of some privacy concerns around it. Whatever service is using now, I have the ability of track. again Ips, and know what is happening.

51
00:08:57.250 --> 00:09:06.989
Clecio Varjao: So the shortening URL was, we decided not to pursue that side. And you'd be another piece of infrastructure that would need to be maintained and supported.

52
00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:12.649
Timo Glastra: Yeah, okay, yeah. No. I think.

53
00:09:12.970 --> 00:09:14.390
Timo Glastra: because

54
00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:26.809
Timo Glastra: E, when you like, you connect to the Http endpoint of the issue, or or like the invite, or anyway, so fetching a document

55
00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:29.919
Timo Glastra: from their surface, I would say, doesn't

56
00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:43.850
Timo Glastra: make tracking more possible, because you already are connecting to their servers and and domain for creating the tick-com connection. and we've in

57
00:09:43.890 --> 00:10:07.300
Timo Glastra: cases just integrated it directly into the agent. So the agent receives the the connection request it also handles the it handles the like to your URL shortener, I think. in a lot of cases you probably want to separate it. But I think for easy deployment.

58
00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:10.639
Timo Glastra: yeah, I think that has worked for us also. Quite well.

59
00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:15.489
Clecio Varjao: Sorry I don't understand the suggestion, then.

60
00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:19.920
Clecio Varjao: So you're saying agent is in charge of the Us. Sharpening

61
00:10:20.530 --> 00:10:22.710
Clecio Varjao: the sure verifier.

62
00:10:23.010 --> 00:10:25.839
Timo Glastra: Well, no, the the creator of the invitation.

63
00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:39.579
Clecio Varjao: Okay, so this is a mobile wallet. So they don't have a HP server. So we need to stand up like a mediator service something on the side.

64
00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:48.149
Timo Glastra: Okay, yeah. So if you have a mediator there is a

65
00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:55.019
Timo Glastra: and ours our C. I wrote specifically for this, and this is how I did it when I wanted to create

66
00:10:55.220 --> 00:11:02.429
Timo Glastra: invitations on the device that we're shortened. is.

67
00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:05.059
Timo Glastra: is it in here?

68
00:11:12.970 --> 00:11:32.049
Ariel Gentile:  I can't find it. If you, if you are talking about the Urls shorten or protocol did come become website.

69
00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:33.810
Timo Glastra: Yeah. Okay.

70
00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:37.429
Timo Glastra: Short, then.

71
00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:42.690
Timo Glastra: here, yeah. So

72
00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:46.659
Timo Glastra: this is a

73
00:11:47.520 --> 00:12:16.839
Timo Glastra: our, where you can use another agent to shorten it for you. and in our case we used it with a mediator. So the mediator you need to contact mediator any way to register the key. But you also request mediator to shorten the URL for you, and then you get back like our shortened URL, which the mediator

74
00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:23.090
Timo Glastra: then holds for you, and there's like a requested for the 2Â s. Does

75
00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:33.109
Timo Glastra: this does add some like tracking possibilities. but you are already sending the the key to

76
00:12:33.340 --> 00:13:00.929
Timo Glastra:  to the the mediator, and when the other device wants to send a message to your device. It has to connect with their device to the mediator, anyway. So yeah. Still, all the connections between the surfers are already made, because the the the the auto device is already connecting to your devices. Mediator. So having that, having it resolved a

77
00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:08.110
Timo Glastra: another object from it, I think. Doesn't in introduce too much new things. but yeah, maybe something to consider.

78
00:13:08.430 --> 00:13:10.069
Clecio Varjao: Okay, I'll look into that one.

79
00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:12.100
Okay.

80
00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:13.289
Timo Glastra: I don't care.

81
00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:15.300
Thank you.

82
00:13:25.970 --> 00:13:29.240
Timo Glastra:  all right.

83
00:13:29.510 --> 00:13:35.010
Timo Glastra: then. agenda. Does anyone have anything specific for the agenda they would like to discuss?

84
00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:51.089
Ariel Gentile: No, I think I think it it would be nice to to review

85
00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:58.790
Ariel Gentile: so many issues and and Pr just to. because that there are some, some peers that that are

86
00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:00.349
Ariel Gentile: open for

87
00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:09.989
Ariel Gentile: a long time like, for instance, it one of for for revocation. So maybe we can. We can try to move forward or or or discard some of them. I I don't know.

88
00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:14.109
Timo Glastra: Sure.

89
00:14:14.930 --> 00:14:21.279
Timo Glastra: I think we can start with some ones that are really open. Really long.

90
00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:33.869
Timo Glastra: this. Pr, yeah. February 9. Already to add concurrency config for process messages concurrently. I think the changes were quite

91
00:14:34.390 --> 00:14:37.520
Timo Glastra: simple.

92
00:14:38.050 --> 00:14:44.279
Timo Glastra: yeah. Instead of like waiting for the previous message to be processed we

93
00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:49.750
Timo Glastra:  we allow them to be processed

94
00:14:50.910 --> 00:14:58.749
Timo Glastra:  concurrently. If you add this config parameter? it seems.

95
00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:00.130
Timo Glastra: I think.

96
00:15:04.970 --> 00:15:05.730
Timo Glastra: Yeah.

97
00:15:06.950 --> 00:15:11.759
Timo Glastra: Do we think this should be merged. Or I'm a bit out of like what

98
00:15:12.510 --> 00:15:14.930
Timo Glastra: it was specifically about.

99
00:15:16.630 --> 00:15:23.740
Ariel Gentile: Yeah, I maybe we we will. We will need to to re review it

100
00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:27.389
Ariel Gentile: just to see what what's missing there.

101
00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:30.020
Timo Glastra: Yeah, okay.

102
00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:32.250
Timo Glastra: anyone want to take that down.

103
00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:47.010
Ariel Gentile: But okay, I will. I will. I will. I will do a review.

104
00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:52.980
Timo Glastra: Yeah, I can. It can else do it. Otherwise you don't have to pick pick them up all of them.

105
00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:56.129
Timo Glastra: Okay, I'll take it. You can take the next one.

106
00:15:58.740 --> 00:16:01.590
Timo Glastra:  okay.

107
00:16:01.890 --> 00:16:09.189
Timo Glastra: out of pen. Proof proposal. good attention, I think.

108
00:16:14.270 --> 00:16:18.320
Timo Glastra: yeah. I think we also need to look into

109
00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:22.090
Timo Glastra: it again and see exactly

110
00:16:22.970 --> 00:16:26.879
Timo Glastra: what the concerns were with this. pr.

111
00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:44.860
Timo Glastra: yeah, okay, I think the the problem is that we look without connection it which in some cases we shouldn't do which I think can be to issues. If I send you a message with for specific threat. Id. I can

112
00:16:44.930 --> 00:16:50.900
Timo Glastra: like hijack a exchange, I think. so yeah, I think

113
00:16:52.030 --> 00:17:06.829
Timo Glastra:  wanted to keep this on hold until we have, like, properly integrated connection this with out of pen, which we've never done so maybe we can merge this with with some small tweaks. I think.

114
00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:09.140
Ariel Gentile: All right.

115
00:17:11.290 --> 00:17:16.540
Timo Glastra:  let me see, do.

116
00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:23.910
Timo Glastra: I can also pick this one of them, I think. I I left last comment on both of these, I know.

117
00:17:24.329 --> 00:17:25.190
Okay.

118
00:17:36.940 --> 00:17:37.730
Timo Glastra: alright.

120
00:17:46.830 --> 00:17:57.119
Timo Glastra: yeah, this is, I think, on hold, because the presentation exchange work is on hold. we have been integrating with it. but there were

121
00:17:57.300 --> 00:18:04.700
Timo Glastra: issues in the Pax library that really prevent this from being integrated. so

122
00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:15.320
Timo Glastra: I think once, those are to rest. I think they're currently being worked on in the in the presentation stage library. we can integrate it. And then we can

123
00:18:15.410 --> 00:18:16.550
Timo Glastra: also

124
00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:27.460
Timo Glastra: integrate this. yeah. So I think we can keep it open for a while now. So we don't lose the the

125
00:18:27.690 --> 00:18:33.239
Timo Glastra: thing. yeah, we don't lose the I think it would be a good test to add.

126
00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:34.410
okay.

127
00:18:39.570 --> 00:18:43.160
Timo Glastra:  this one.

128
00:18:44.470 --> 00:18:50.150
Timo Glastra:  yeah. Lot of good changes in here.

129
00:18:52.210 --> 00:18:56.760
Timo Glastra: I think we need to updated to integrate with

130
00:18:57.670 --> 00:19:01.810
Timo Glastra: some of the latest runner updates.

131
00:19:02.620 --> 00:19:08.180
Timo Glastra:  and

132
00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:21.020
Timo Glastra: yeah, So yeah, I, I'm not sure if anchor is still going to pick this up. So maybe yeah, we need to

133
00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:22.920
Timo Glastra: take it over

134
00:19:22.970 --> 00:19:33.450
Timo Glastra: and get it merged, because I think there are a lot of good things in here like things that we are gonna break soon. If we don't merge this and it updates it to all the latest versions.

135
00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:41.209
Ariel Gentile: yeah, if we, if we can add, commits there, I maybe I can. I can pick them up, pick them up. And

136
00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:45.029
Ariel Gentile: and just

137
00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:49.619
Timo Glastra: okay, yeah, that I think, can we?

138
00:19:51.280 --> 00:20:02.889
Timo Glastra:  it's from checked. You can push to organization things. So you would need to for their their. Pr, yeah. Okay.

139
00:20:05.050 --> 00:20:08.370
Ariel Gentile: Okay.

140
00:20:08.410 --> 00:20:11.750
Ariel Gentile: Asking uncle to to.

141
00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:15.340
Timo Glastra: yeah. Okay.

143
00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:48.480
Timo Glastra: Okay.

144
00:20:49.030 --> 00:20:49.760
okay.

145
00:20:52.550 --> 00:21:00.229
Timo Glastra:  This one is open. I just never finished it. I don't. Yeah. I

146
00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:19.969
Timo Glastra: wanted to add a role to the credential to improve records, because it's sometimes very hard to determine which role belongs to a record, especially if they're in state, Dom, or like whatever state But I just didn't finish it. So something I'll have to pick up at some point.

147
00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:26.310
Timo Glastra:  this one.

148
00:21:31.310 --> 00:21:33.410
Timo Glastra: yeah. So

149
00:21:33.530 --> 00:21:49.199
Timo Glastra: using a mill to use invitation multiple times, so I already connect received email to use invitation, and I want to use it again. the change being made here is to

150
00:21:49.730 --> 00:22:03.359
Timo Glastra: remove the check if we have already connected to this id and that allows it to just like create another out of band directed for the Id.

151
00:22:03.940 --> 00:22:08.760
Timo Glastra: My concern with this approach was that. as I

152
00:22:08.970 --> 00:22:11.680
Timo Glastra: understand it, that

153
00:22:12.260 --> 00:22:31.569
Timo Glastra: ids need to be like message ids need to be unique within the context of an agent. and this breaks that model. because we basically have multiple out ofence records with the same id, then which can get tricky So

154
00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:36.419
Timo Glastra:  I think if we want to reuse the same

155
00:22:37.130 --> 00:22:52.729
Timo Glastra: invitation multiple times, we need to think about it like, okay, what's the the impact of that or the implications. yeah, I know. Are you that done? Some research into this the last time? Right? Or yes, I think the the only.

156
00:22:53.140 --> 00:22:57.090
Ariel Gentile: the only issue would be on the

157
00:22:57.120 --> 00:23:03.700
Ariel Gentile: the mediation. a recipient or not module.

158
00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:07.929
Ariel Gentile: because if you have this

159
00:23:08.070 --> 00:23:11.720
Ariel Gentile: an invite, or something like that.

160
00:23:12.590 --> 00:23:15.870
Ariel Gentile: it it will. It will try to to

161
00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:21.280
Ariel Gentile: to find a single connection from that invitation. So

162
00:23:21.830 --> 00:23:24.969
Ariel Gentile: it would break, as you as you say.

163
00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:29.029
Ariel Gentile: But if we change the logic there.

164
00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:33.549
Ariel Gentile: we should not have any any particular issue, I mean.

165
00:23:34.850 --> 00:23:38.820
Ariel Gentile: according to what they understood. Nothing from this

166
00:23:39.090 --> 00:23:42.880
Ariel Gentile: from the spec are, is preventing to have

167
00:23:43.350 --> 00:23:46.710
Ariel Gentile: to to connections

168
00:23:46.930 --> 00:23:51.229
Ariel Gentile: may or start bootstrap it from the same invitation.

169
00:23:52.230 --> 00:23:53.759
Ariel Gentile: So technically.

170
00:23:54.050 --> 00:23:59.210
Ariel Gentile: it's not incorrect to to to remove this check

171
00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:08.189
Ariel Gentile:  and also sometimes what something that that happens to me sometimes in in in our app. Is that

172
00:24:08.860 --> 00:24:12.330
Ariel Gentile: us kind of a your code with an invitation.

173
00:24:12.370 --> 00:24:14.770
Ariel Gentile: And if you are not connected

174
00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:22.820
Ariel Gentile: to Internet or or you have a a problem. then you will have a an error, and and

175
00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:32.950
Ariel Gentile: and if you will, if you are going to scand the same clear again. You. You have to make sure that delete the the out of the record that has been created for that.

176
00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:36.660
Ariel Gentile: because otherwise the framework will reject the

177
00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:40.910
Ariel Gentile: we will not allow you to to to to

178
00:24:40.970 --> 00:24:48.940
Ariel Gentile: Mit Ctl and receive again this invitation, I mean with with the same correct code. So you you will need to ask the other party to create a new quick, your code 250,

179
00:24:49.260 --> 00:24:53.899
Ariel Gentile: and sometimes it's it's something that is not so. I know it.

180
00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:56.400
Ariel Gentile: It will need.

181
00:24:58.110 --> 00:25:02.760
Ariel Gentile: If you don't manually delete the out of the record. You will have

182
00:25:03.820 --> 00:25:07.430
Ariel Gentile: several records that they are not use it, but

183
00:25:08.230 --> 00:25:10.639
Ariel Gentile: I don't know. I think

184
00:25:10.870 --> 00:25:11.940
Ariel Gentile: it should.

185
00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:17.399
Ariel Gentile: It's not. It's not bad to have this, this, this change in the in the frame

186
00:25:18.340 --> 00:25:19.410
there.

187
00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:28.810
Ariel Gentile: But, as I said, we will need to also modify the initialization of the mediation model because

188
00:25:29.230 --> 00:25:31.029
Ariel Gentile: it will fail

189
00:25:31.270 --> 00:25:34.150
Ariel Gentile: if we have. and

190
00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:40.779
Ariel Gentile: if have more than one invitation cliche, one wants to say something.

191
00:25:41.540 --> 00:25:44.909
Clecio Varjao: I have a question over something that you say that

192
00:25:46.170 --> 00:25:51.660
Clecio Varjao: when you delete a connection they'd have been records to remain so. They're separate.

193
00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:56.590
Ariel Gentile: I? I think so. Yes.

194
00:26:00.250 --> 00:26:04.889
Clecio Varjao: okay. So we just probably to make some changes in by phone. Then

195
00:26:05.340 --> 00:26:16.530
Clecio Varjao: so deleting a contact is it recommended to delete both the connection and the out of band record should be fully removed.

196
00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:26.120
Timo Glastra:  it depends on as a holder.

197
00:26:26.150 --> 00:26:31.030
Timo Glastra: probably. Yes.  because

198
00:26:31.830 --> 00:26:59.169
Timo Glastra:  the you as a holder? Probably. Yes, because there's always a single connection tight to an out of pend record, but as like a or like a if you are the creator of a mil to use invitation, for example, you can have one out ofence record with thousands of connections. and it could be that you remove one connection, but you don't want to remove all the other

199
00:26:59.170 --> 00:27:19.809
Timo Glastra: connections or the out of pen invitation, like new people can still connect to it. so in that case, no, but in in in like the case of like, I created the single use invitation, or I received a single use, invitation, or like received an invitation, then it makes sense to also removed out of ventric.

200
00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:23.100
Clecio Varjao: Okay.

201
00:27:24.590 --> 00:27:30.789
Clecio Varjao: is there anything on the as a flag, or when the leading a connection, or those are 2 separate steps.

202
00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:36.930
Timo Glastra: separate steps, because you can also.

203
00:27:36.980 --> 00:27:42.680
Timo Glastra: I have I can receive. I've been

204
00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:49.009
Timo Glastra: invitations and reuse connections. So there could actually be like

205
00:27:49.070 --> 00:27:51.610
Timo Glastra: a lot of out of bench records

206
00:27:51.660 --> 00:27:52.810
Timo Glastra: also

207
00:27:52.980 --> 00:28:04.249
Timo Glastra: connected to a connection itself. so we could add some logic to remove Associated connection records. But it yeah, it gets a bit complicated, I think.

208
00:28:06.330 --> 00:28:12.300
Clecio Varjao: Okay, I I just think we probably need to clean that up again from we'll buy a hold. Their point of view.

209
00:28:12.350 --> 00:28:15.580
Clecio Varjao: the user experiences, they think they are deleting the contact.

210
00:28:15.670 --> 00:28:23.160
Clecio Varjao: So therefore everything should be gone. And it sounds like this. I would have been record this thing around

211
00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:26.000
Clecio Varjao: left over somehow.

212
00:28:26.340 --> 00:28:27.130
Clecio Varjao: Okay.

213
00:28:27.790 --> 00:28:35.499
Timo Glastra: yeah. I mean, there is something to say to just remove the out of bench record directly after you've created the connection because you don't need it anymore.

214
00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:40.479
Timo Glastra: so maybe that's also something we should advertise more.

215
00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:49.530
Clecio Varjao: All right. So upon completing the connection the out of and record can be privileged as well. There's no need to keep them around

216
00:28:50.050 --> 00:28:51.749
Clecio Varjao: unless does it.

217
00:28:51.850 --> 00:28:57.379
Clecio Varjao: If there is a if there is any. If there is a mode to use connection or

218
00:28:57.540 --> 00:29:05.239
Clecio Varjao: not the out of band that call for a reuse connection. Do you need that original out of an invitation.

219
00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:21.529
Timo Glastra: No, only only if you create a mil to use invitation, the mil to use invitation will become invalid if you delete the out of Pennsylvania, because basically, the outfit's record is the mill to use invitation.

220
00:29:21.830 --> 00:29:28.580
Clecio Varjao: Yeah, if you're the one creating the invitation, you have to get it. But if you don't, you' the invitation, then it's relevant.

221
00:29:29.110 --> 00:29:30.749
Timo Glastra: Yeah, then it can be removed.

222
00:29:30.990 --> 00:29:32.340
Clecio Varjao: Okay, thank you.

223
00:29:33.130 --> 00:29:33.990
Timo Glastra: Yeah.

224
00:29:34.210 --> 00:29:39.560
Clecio Varjao: Which brings your question. Do you know if there is any plan for a Fj to maybe create a

225
00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:43.259
Clecio Varjao: Api docs. Yes.

226
00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:46.999
Clecio Varjao: in addition to the guides that already exist which are pretty good.

227
00:29:48.650 --> 00:29:52.699
Timo Glastra: Yeah, yeah, it's on the plan. But like, not something

228
00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:53.780
Timo Glastra: we have.

229
00:29:53.870 --> 00:30:00.750
Timo Glastra: I had spent time on or like, I'm not sure if we have time to spend that in the near future, I think.

230
00:30:01.090 --> 00:30:02.330
Clecio Varjao: Okay, thank you.

231
00:30:04.570 --> 00:30:13.649
Ariel Gentile: Sorry. Are you hijacked as a a little bit?

232
00:30:14.430 --> 00:30:17.499
Ariel Gentile: We can. We can.

233
00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:25.989
Ariel Gentile: It would be good to to remove this check, but also but we will need to make sure that that the

234
00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:30.049
Ariel Gentile: the mediation module is so it's probably updated.

235
00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:06.930
Timo Glastra: if if

236
00:31:06.980 --> 00:31:16.549
Timo Glastra:  Patrick. I can't pick it up. Can you address this? or

237
00:31:16.650 --> 00:31:19.080
Ariel Gentile: yeah, no problem it it it should be

238
00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:21.250
a quick, actually

239
00:31:25.470 --> 00:31:26.200
Timo Glastra: cool.

240
00:31:28.420 --> 00:31:29.510
Timo Glastra: Sounds good.

241
00:31:32.550 --> 00:31:36.010
Timo Glastra:   this one?

242
00:31:38.270 --> 00:31:40.320
Ariel Gentile: Yeah, I think

243
00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:42.400
Timo Glastra: big. Pr.

244
00:31:42.590 --> 00:31:47.830
Ariel Gentile: yes. And I, I added this most or all of the

245
00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:51.660
Ariel Gentile: the feed of you you gave

246
00:31:52.250 --> 00:31:53.809
Ariel Gentile: in may I think

247
00:31:55.570 --> 00:32:00.429
Ariel Gentile: There are still some questions.

248
00:32:00.900 --> 00:32:01.900
Ariel Gentile: I think.

249
00:32:02.810 --> 00:32:05.679
Ariel Gentile: but

250
00:32:06.220 --> 00:32:10.230
Ariel Gentile: it will be nice if you can, if you can look at them.

251
00:32:12.020 --> 00:32:12.970
Ariel Gentile: And

252
00:32:13.340 --> 00:32:23.329
Ariel Gentile: because I think you. You started doing a review when we were at the the the dice in in 3 weeks. But you you didn't finish it.

253
00:32:23.950 --> 00:32:24.790
Ariel Gentile: I think.

254
00:32:25.130 --> 00:32:30.210
Timo Glastra: Yeah. So I I think I I finished it. So I think,

255
00:32:31.940 --> 00:32:37.699
Ariel Gentile: okay. So if it, if if you consider it finished, maybe I can. I can do those

256
00:32:37.810 --> 00:32:40.160
Ariel Gentile: the small modifications. And

257
00:32:40.940 --> 00:32:53.649
Ariel Gentile: yeah, we can probably continue like that. I mean it. We will be using only this manual way of of or external way of handling

258
00:32:53.770 --> 00:33:01.530
Ariel Gentile: a the indexes on that stuff. And maybe in a future we can

259
00:33:01.620 --> 00:33:06.239
Ariel Gentile: incorporate some automatic stuff in the in the framework if if needed.

260
00:33:16.660 --> 00:33:26.150
Timo Glastra:  okay? And does it introduce any breaking chases? Besides, to the interface of the

261
00:33:27.380 --> 00:33:32.659
Ariel Gentile: no? No, the the only issue is that if you have

262
00:33:32.740 --> 00:33:34.260
Ariel Gentile: if you have a

263
00:33:34.650 --> 00:33:53.169
Ariel Gentile: a ratio 3 and an increase in the implementation, you will have to update it, because now you are required to to also support these methods or include the method methods for revocation.

264
00:33:53.770 --> 00:33:54.970
Timo Glastra: Yeah.

265
00:33:56.410 --> 00:33:58.309
Ariel Gentile: which was something that was

266
00:33:58.760 --> 00:33:59.550
there

267
00:33:59.710 --> 00:34:00.600
Ariel Gentile: before.

268
00:34:03.140 --> 00:34:04.490
Timo Glastra: I think we

269
00:34:07.330 --> 00:34:17.460
Timo Glastra:  may that experimental right? So that it can have breaking changes

270
00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:28.639
Timo Glastra:  you see, is there? I made a Pr for that right?

271
00:34:29.659 --> 00:34:42.220
Timo Glastra: Or it's probably this one.  so it's the Democrats for us module.

272
00:34:45.260 --> 00:34:46.610
Timo Glastra: I'll scar

273
00:34:47.620 --> 00:34:50.610
Timo Glastra: Pbs checks.

274
00:34:53.630 --> 00:34:57.029
Timo Glastra: They were to see credentials

275
00:35:01.030 --> 00:35:02.010
Timo Glastra: 10Â min

276
00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:10.320
Timo Glastra: so I did it at once to implementing your own Red Street, I think. or maybe on the

277
00:35:11.970 --> 00:35:15.270
Timo Glastra:  updating guides.

278
00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:22.490
Timo Glastra: Okay? So I added it here.

279
00:35:24.210 --> 00:35:25.160
Ariel Gentile: Yeah.

280
00:35:25.770 --> 00:35:28.120
Timo Glastra: So I'm not sure. I'm so so

281
00:35:29.480 --> 00:35:30.470
Timo Glastra: at it.

282
00:35:30.840 --> 00:35:33.849
Ariel Gentile: okay, okay, okay, so that's fine.

283
00:35:34.450 --> 00:35:35.150
Timo Glastra: Yeah.

284
00:35:36.460 --> 00:35:37.720
Timo Glastra: cool. Okay.

286
00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:18.710
Timo Glastra: cool.

287
00:36:28.370 --> 00:36:42.499
Timo Glastra:  This one is a book I fixed to make document load of work in node. 18 but the ci now feels so

288
00:36:44.060 --> 00:36:47.000
Timo Glastra: something I have to look into.

289
00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:02.840
Timo Glastra: Okay.

290
00:37:03.770 --> 00:37:12.380
Timo Glastra:  this one is. accept it and ready to merge.

291
00:37:12.990 --> 00:37:13.950
Timo Glastra: So

292
00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:24.070
Timo Glastra: I think it's just a simple fix to take the the role property into account. And then that request.

293
00:37:27.820 --> 00:37:30.289
Timo Glastra: And we actually got something merch today.

294
00:37:31.340 --> 00:37:36.250
Timo Glastra:  parents.

295
00:37:37.500 --> 00:37:40.920
Timo Glastra: this pr experience still here.

296
00:37:41.340 --> 00:37:50.890
Ariel Gentile: Oh, he he left as as soon as we started with the Pr review. So so maybe he's only waiting to that.

297
00:37:51.320 --> 00:37:55.170
Timo Glastra: Yeah, all right. So

298
00:37:56.290 --> 00:37:59.440
Timo Glastra: we have actually incorporated these changes

299
00:37:59.750 --> 00:38:03.730
Timo Glastra: from this pr in a

300
00:38:04.060 --> 00:38:21.839
Timo Glastra: in the ball that we built ourselves. But there is like it's dependent on a  pr, that is in here. that we're also using. And I think.

301
00:38:24.180 --> 00:38:25.370
Timo Glastra: yeah, so

302
00:38:26.250 --> 00:38:34.310
Timo Glastra: we need to wait for this to be fully work. So I can look into this again and and try to get this

303
00:38:34.350 --> 00:38:35.430
Timo Glastra: marched.

304
00:38:58.480 --> 00:38:59.370
Timo Glastra: Okay.

305
00:39:02.540 --> 00:39:03.720
Timo Glastra: then

306
00:39:03.960 --> 00:39:06.119
Timo Glastra: this one

307
00:39:06.230 --> 00:39:07.090
Timo Glastra: and

308
00:39:07.780 --> 00:39:16.369
Timo Glastra: Arthur is on the call today. Let me see. So they split up the demo into 2 cases. Yeah, cool.

309
00:39:16.980 --> 00:39:20.160
Timo Glastra: the main. And did comfy, too. I think.

310
00:39:20.170 --> 00:39:26.870
Timo Glastra: Yeah, we took a really long time to refute this. Pr I left a comment.

311
00:39:35.490 --> 00:39:48.180
Timo Glastra: yeah. So I left a comment. that I think it would be easier, maybe, if we can keep the same demo and then have  

312
00:39:49.330 --> 00:39:59.389
Timo Glastra: yeah, it just adds like different features to it. So I did. Confi. One did conf me, too, so that you don't have to run completely different demos for different cases.

313
00:39:59.990 --> 00:40:06.380
Timo Glastra: yeah. Well. what do people think of it that it now for our to be if any comments on this pr or

314
00:40:10.230 --> 00:40:13.580
Artem Ivanov: actually Hello, everyone

315
00:40:13.580 --> 00:40:41.489
Artem Ivanov: If they replied the intention was was speaking to them in the parts. It's like there are some models which are optional. for for example, in you voted in as far as it, and you cannot just integrate both with single Dama And in order to demonstrate this capability, we need to create separate demos and similar folders.

316
00:40:41.490 --> 00:40:53.530
Artem Ivanov: And this is why I decided to split the get common one. And it's going to be 2 also in the independent Demos. So in future we can create you them as easily

317
00:41:00.840 --> 00:41:03.239
Timo Glastra: cool. Yeah,

318
00:41:04.870 --> 00:41:28.350
Timo Glastra: I think. I'm I'm fine in general with splitting it up. I think it's just a like if we can prevent by maybe adding like, just if you add a feature that's only available in in some demo, we say like this is not supported within the sk or or something. I just It's always hard to decide to think where to split Demos. because if you're

319
00:41:28.350 --> 00:41:50.049
Timo Glastra: are, you gonna do it on dip conversions, or are you gonna do it? Then, on credential formats or exchange layers they call for open id, and then, you get a lot of different demos that yeah, maybe hard to do. But yeah, I think I'm fine with it. If I don't know if anyone else is comments on this.

320
00:41:53.960 --> 00:41:58.919
Ariel Gentile: Yeah, I think I think it's I need the approach.

321
00:41:59.390 --> 00:42:03.019
Ariel Gentile: I suppose, by Artemis. This is okay.

322
00:42:03.790 --> 00:42:13.660
Ariel Gentile: My only concern about which is not related to our team's work is actually because if I don't know if you have seen that

323
00:42:13.940 --> 00:42:17.770
Ariel Gentile: I have reviewed the problems on the D on the day more

324
00:42:18.420 --> 00:42:22.139
Ariel Gentile: in general. and it seemed

325
00:42:23.530 --> 00:42:26.820
Ariel Gentile: the demo as it is right now. It's not

326
00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:31.140
Ariel Gentile: working fine. and

327
00:42:31.490 --> 00:42:38.319
Ariel Gentile: I think it's related to the problem that we have on the performance for.

328
00:42:39.450 --> 00:42:44.969
Ariel Gentile: because you will need to patch the Ref Nappy in order to make it work properly.

329
00:42:47.170 --> 00:42:48.910
Ariel Gentile: Yeah. So

330
00:42:50.850 --> 00:43:00.249
Ariel Gentile: because I I I I try to run the demo following the steps. We. we say in the read me.

331
00:43:01.310 --> 00:43:08.659
Ariel Gentile: and if we I mean, if we do, the the the rip of clone and the young install, and that stuff.

332
00:43:09.310 --> 00:43:12.270
Ariel Gentile: It will not patch the

333
00:43:12.460 --> 00:43:17.570
Ariel Gentile: because this is something, something that is working only on Ci automatically.

334
00:43:18.070 --> 00:43:22.210
Ariel Gentile: So it will work very slowly.

335
00:43:22.310 --> 00:43:25.190
Ariel Gentile: And what

336
00:43:25.330 --> 00:43:33.080
Ariel Gentile: you will have this, this problem of of time out on, and what has been reported some time ago with a

337
00:43:33.620 --> 00:43:34.980
Ariel Gentile: this, you guys.

338
00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:42.930
Ariel Gentile: one of your suggesting, I think, was to move the demo to another rapport.

339
00:43:44.710 --> 00:43:50.540
Ariel Gentile: So maybe maybe if we are having more and more

340
00:43:50.600 --> 00:44:00.039
Ariel Gentile:  yeah. subsets of of of testing or of Demos. Maybe we can do something

341
00:44:01.070 --> 00:44:08.110
Ariel Gentile: specific or or a specific repo for for Demos, and to show with different flows. And

342
00:44:08.300 --> 00:44:10.010
Ariel Gentile: I'll let

343
00:44:10.510 --> 00:44:14.780
Ariel Gentile: on what? Maybe we can do something like that in a future.

344
00:44:16.250 --> 00:44:24.430
Timo Glastra: Yeah, I think having a separate demo repo for the demo. Or maybe some example flows, and that kind of stuff. I think that

345
00:44:25.340 --> 00:44:44.340
Timo Glastra: I think that's good. because then it we can really simplify the whole setup. You also have to do for the demo. I don't have to need to have all the complex dependencies, and and the issues we have here. and then we can just make the demo repository. Note 18, only.

346
00:44:44.390 --> 00:44:49.449
Timo Glastra:  And I think, yeah, that would probably fix a lot of these issues.

347
00:44:50.190 --> 00:44:55.930
Ariel Gentile: And now, so maybe I I I imagine that some people will will start

348
00:44:56.690 --> 00:44:59.409
Ariel Gentile: from the day most to set up their projects.

349
00:45:00.580 --> 00:45:07.850
Ariel Gentile: and if we are, we are already using this. they will not have

350
00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:17.150
Ariel Gentile: these issues, because, you know, I know we we we mentioned this in the on the documentation and and and the guides, but usually

351
00:45:17.780 --> 00:45:27.929
Ariel Gentile: well, you know, we are usually people try to to test the code and and we'll and we'll only read the documentation if

352
00:45:28.010 --> 00:45:29.410
Ariel Gentile: they have a problem.

353
00:45:30.250 --> 00:45:36.629
Ariel Gentile: So if we can, if we can prevent them to have the problem, it will be better. I think.

354
00:45:37.810 --> 00:45:39.930
Timo Glastra: yeah. that makes sense.

355
00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:47.830
Timo Glastra:  okay, anyone object to extracting the demo from this repo.

356
00:45:50.070 --> 00:45:57.679
Clecio Varjao: I don't necessarily object. I just want to make it comment that you might also add complexity to maintain

357
00:45:57.770 --> 00:46:04.600
Clecio Varjao: the table. because, as the the code, the Api or a new version evolves, now.

358
00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:11.149
Clecio Varjao: there's an extra effort to keep that demo updated, and it might be a red the case that it's ready.

359
00:46:11.230 --> 00:46:15.729
Clecio Varjao: out of date for that reason. But again, just wanted to

360
00:46:16.320 --> 00:46:27.210
Clecio Varjao: raise the risk that the demo becomes kind of after taught. and it will just quickly become abandoned where we check with other projects, kind of what happens.

361
00:46:28.130 --> 00:46:53.869
Clecio Varjao: So it depends how much you want to keep it in line with the code, and and if someone is trying, maybe the main branch for Afj maybe has latest features, and they want to demo that one. Now they have to go back to another repository. How do we keep those demo in sick with the features that are available in the May or in the features that were available in the in a previous release. That's going to be a little bit the challenge.

362
00:46:55.890 --> 00:46:56.550
Yeah.

363
00:46:56.780 --> 00:46:59.909
Timo Glastra: fair fair comment.

364
00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:03.470
Charles Lanahan: it's kind of already like that. I mean.

365
00:47:03.800 --> 00:47:06.989
Charles Lanahan: I don't think the demo is working for the past 4 months

366
00:47:07.660 --> 00:47:11.649
Charles Lanahan: it. It probably should hook into the Cic or capital to date, because

367
00:47:12.080 --> 00:47:15.740
Charles Lanahan: because certainly when I came to the project, the first thing I did was, look at the demo

368
00:47:15.810 --> 00:47:19.410
Charles Lanahan: to try to, you know, get an idea of how to kind of do stuff. And and

369
00:47:19.950 --> 00:47:25.449
Charles Lanahan: there, there, I just got a different mistake every time. So it was fixed. So it was a little frustrating.

370
00:47:26.480 --> 00:47:31.049
Charles Lanahan: Putting in another, you know, makes it a little harder to to.

371
00:47:32.150 --> 00:47:33.950
Clecio Varjao: Yeah. So it it may be.

372
00:47:34.190 --> 00:47:45.870
Clecio Varjao: I mean, what's missing is that demo, as you mentioned that that demo has to be C, I, CD and tested as part of the build flow. That's another test that it needs to be passed.

373
00:47:46.720 --> 00:47:51.689
Ariel Gentile: Yeah. But but but do you think that we can

374
00:47:52.180 --> 00:47:59.680
Ariel Gentile: run the the ref Nappy patch if we put it into the the resolutions of this package that Jason

375
00:48:00.500 --> 00:48:01.530
Ariel Gentile: or

376
00:48:02.410 --> 00:48:04.599
Ariel Gentile: I mean they need it.

377
00:48:06.320 --> 00:48:13.360
Timo Glastra: We could maybe by. like, the problem is that in

378
00:48:13.970 --> 00:48:39.350
Timo Glastra: I think there's a few problems. we could add it as a dependency, and not with like the resolution. The problem, then, is that the package is published to only work with. Note 18. So if you try to, then run your on install in the whole repo in in in Node 16, it will give, I think, an error, or, like your note engine is not compatible with this package, and then it can install it.

379
00:48:39.370 --> 00:48:49.700
Timo Glastra: If you were to bypass that issue we could, I think, do it manually in the demo with a resolution

380
00:48:50.240 --> 00:48:55.210
Timo Glastra:  field or something, or we could just like

381
00:48:55.320 --> 00:48:57.039
Timo Glastra: check that. If you're

382
00:48:57.200 --> 00:49:03.119
Timo Glastra: not in Note 18, we to an hour either way, like and we

383
00:49:03.160 --> 00:49:16.719
Timo Glastra: create an alias for the Ref. May not be packet, so it it always used like the your patch version. I think that that should be possible. But we it would require some work and changes to the fact just and how we set things up.

384
00:49:25.170 --> 00:49:29.740
Timo Glastra:  yeah, I do think.

385
00:49:30.770 --> 00:49:48.280
Timo Glastra: there are some things to consider here. Maybe some potential benefits with extracting. It is that We currently now have to keep it up to date with every every change in

386
00:49:48.990 --> 00:50:14.710
Timo Glastra: the repository, which is good. But if we don't do it, it's it's there's a lot more potential to break it. Well, if you extract it it can never be broken, basically. because you always use a version of a and the only thing it can is that it becomes outdated. But I'm not sure what's worse, and outdated or broken, Demo.

387
00:50:20.930 --> 00:50:24.850
Charles Lanahan: but broken, broken, is worse, I I think in my opinion.

388
00:50:25.020 --> 00:50:41.270
Charles Lanahan: outdated is like, Oh, we don't do that anymore when you ask a question, but broken is like, What did I do wrong, as as especially as a beginner coming in  It's hard to tell whether the error is like mine. it doesn't demo or or if it's the demo itself. It's that's hearing out.

389
00:50:43.210 --> 00:50:47.710
Ariel Gentile: Yeah, yeah, it's like, it's like they they did the right right. It's like.

390
00:50:47.950 --> 00:50:57.179
Ariel Gentile: if we wanted to to have to to keep the the deduction in the same repo, because we want to make sure that it is always up to date. But it's

391
00:50:57.660 --> 00:51:00.069
Ariel Gentile: it is not necessarily true.

392
00:51:00.560 --> 00:51:06.570
Ariel Gentile: because we are not running the demo on the C Icd step. So

393
00:51:07.040 --> 00:51:10.410
Ariel Gentile: it happens, what is happening right now.

394
00:51:10.600 --> 00:51:15.029
Ariel Gentile: even if it's there, it's it's broken. So. Yeah.

395
00:51:15.760 --> 00:51:22.229
Ariel Gentile: but I by, I totally understand what, what, what, what cliche says. It's it's true that we will need to to

396
00:51:22.630 --> 00:51:26.779
Ariel Gentile: to keep an eye on on on other people as well. So yeah.

397
00:51:26.870 --> 00:51:29.250
Ariel Gentile: it will be a little bit more of

398
00:51:29.610 --> 00:51:30.630
Ariel Gentile: work. But

399
00:51:31.790 --> 00:51:33.820
Ariel Gentile: I I think

400
00:51:35.620 --> 00:51:38.879
Timo Glastra: I mean I I know when when we make like a new

401
00:51:39.150 --> 00:51:47.929
Timo Glastra: big release. Also, I need to update the dogs at migration guides to the documentation website. So I think updating the Demo.

402
00:51:48.170 --> 00:52:00.270
Timo Glastra: It's probably not that much work. and then we would have at least a stable demo that doesn't break with every commit, because I think running it in Ci is quite

403
00:52:00.340 --> 00:52:09.020
Timo Glastra: complex because it's a cli tool. So then we would have to write text for a cli and interact the cli

404
00:52:09.360 --> 00:52:16.450
Timo Glastra: kind of interface which I'm not sure is worth the complexity.

405
00:52:26.910 --> 00:52:28.490
Charles Lanahan: Yeah, that makes sense.

406
00:52:35.030 --> 00:52:37.060
Timo Glastra: okay? So

407
00:52:37.540 --> 00:52:43.970
Timo Glastra: yeah, I would then propose to to yeah, extract it and that we

408
00:52:44.290 --> 00:52:53.539
Timo Glastra: update it for like, because it shouldn't even break between like 2 or 4, 1 0 for 2. So it should only break whenever

409
00:52:53.550 --> 00:53:03.509
Timo Glastra:  whenever a a breaking change release is made, which is like not often

410
00:53:03.730 --> 00:53:05.020
Timo Glastra: currently

411
00:53:11.260 --> 00:53:19.709
Timo Glastra:  let me see this. This can now be

412
00:53:23.480 --> 00:53:26.219
Timo Glastra: some. Just a comment,

413
00:53:26.980 --> 00:53:27.780
Timo Glastra: okay.

414
00:53:27.960 --> 00:53:30.650
Timo Glastra:  then

415
00:54:09.080 --> 00:54:10.740
Timo Glastra: cool anyone that

416
00:54:10.990 --> 00:54:12.970
Timo Glastra: would like to pick up this issue.

417
00:54:31.480 --> 00:54:34.630
Timo Glastra: Okay? And for now at

418
00:54:37.030 --> 00:54:43.640
Timo Glastra: this one here and then someone can pick it up when we have the time.

419
00:54:44.090 --> 00:54:50.679
Timo Glastra:  let me see any Pr. We

420
00:54:51.210 --> 00:54:53.879
Timo Glastra: haven't discussed yet.

421
00:54:54.320 --> 00:55:00.530
Timo Glastra:  we discussed this one.

422
00:55:00.920 --> 00:55:01.600
Timo Glastra: Oh.

423
00:55:01.770 --> 00:55:05.970
Timo Glastra: but we didn't finish this one. but I think.

424
00:55:16.980 --> 00:55:20.170
Timo Glastra:  okay.

425
00:55:21.090 --> 00:55:22.600
Timo Glastra: then I think,

426
00:55:23.910 --> 00:55:25.219
Timo Glastra: we can

427
00:55:26.150 --> 00:55:28.020
Timo Glastra: get this merged.

428
00:55:31.160 --> 00:55:34.230
Timo Glastra: can you resolve the conflicts

429
00:55:34.380 --> 00:55:35.130
Artem Ivanov: cool.

430
00:55:37.330 --> 00:55:38.149
Timo Glastra: Thank you.

431
00:55:39.850 --> 00:55:55.519
Timo Glastra: no, not this one, this one.  are any comments on this one? Do we need to discuss anything about this? Pr.

432
00:55:55.590 --> 00:55:58.040
Ariel Gentile: yeah, it was I.

433
00:55:58.540 --> 00:56:06.350
Ariel Gentile: I I did a. A. A branch to others. This this, what? What we discussed last week?

434
00:56:07.550 --> 00:56:13.679
Ariel Gentile:  maybe we you you can open open their these, the link

435
00:56:13.790 --> 00:56:15.240
Ariel Gentile: you will see the changes.

436
00:56:20.750 --> 00:56:21.610
Ariel Gentile: So

437
00:56:22.530 --> 00:56:26.149
Ariel Gentile: what I don't like about this approach is that

438
00:56:26.380 --> 00:56:27.460
Ariel Gentile: we are

439
00:56:29.430 --> 00:56:35.180
Ariel Gentile: I mean the the the code is quite a straightforward 3 and 2. I mean, it's

440
00:56:35.470 --> 00:56:39.219
Ariel Gentile: just a few lines of cover. But what I don't like is that

441
00:56:39.430 --> 00:56:42.770
Ariel Gentile: we are. We are.

442
00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:48.930
Ariel Gentile: We are having you on great Api. and it's config

443
00:56:49.860 --> 00:56:53.530
Ariel Gentile: as a dependency of the services.

444
00:56:55.400 --> 00:56:56.740
Ariel Gentile: So

445
00:56:58.510 --> 00:57:04.460
Ariel Gentile: it's not something that I mean, it's not something natural, I will say right.

446
00:57:05.750 --> 00:57:09.200
Ariel Gentile: and also the

447
00:57:11.390 --> 00:57:12.300
Ariel Gentile: I

448
00:57:12.660 --> 00:57:25.429
Ariel Gentile: I think that it's it would be more straightforward to if if we can have this this auto create link, secret configuration

449
00:57:25.620 --> 00:57:31.590
Ariel Gentile: as a configuration of the of an ongrade erase or

450
00:57:32.480 --> 00:57:33.880
Ariel Gentile: in the SDK

451
00:57:35.370 --> 00:57:36.650
Ariel Gentile: directly.

452
00:57:37.090 --> 00:57:43.030
Ariel Gentile: so in that in that way we will not be dependent on the on the

453
00:57:43.250 --> 00:57:44.240
Ariel Gentile: module.

454
00:57:44.570 --> 00:57:48.900
Ariel Gentile: but only on our own configuration.

455
00:57:57.270 --> 00:58:04.570
Ariel Gentile: because we we are using a I I config parameter from anon credits from another module.

456
00:58:06.330 --> 00:58:14.939
Ariel Gentile: So if if an ongraduate is, say something, and we we are, it's up to us to to implement it or not.

457
00:58:15.010 --> 00:58:24.249
Ariel Gentile: No, no one will force us to to do what they config. They didn't do the I don't. Chris. Module conflict size, I mean

458
00:58:24.350 --> 00:58:28.999
Ariel Gentile: we. If we, if we create another implementation of an on credits.

459
00:58:29.580 --> 00:58:31.999
Ariel Gentile: I don't know. I don't. Great

460
00:58:33.020 --> 00:58:35.659
Ariel Gentile: anything. I see. C. I don't know.

461
00:58:35.950 --> 00:58:39.130
Ariel Gentile: and we we create a an another module.

462
00:58:39.330 --> 00:58:44.470
Ariel Gentile: and we are not following this

463
00:58:45.310 --> 00:58:49.990
Ariel Gentile: this secret parameter. Nobody will know about that.

464
00:58:51.810 --> 00:58:53.679
Ariel Gentile: So I don't know.

465
00:58:55.060 --> 00:58:56.650
Timo Glastra: Yeah, I think

466
00:58:57.310 --> 00:58:57.990
Timo Glastra: it

467
00:58:58.830 --> 00:59:04.900
Timo Glastra: from a user perspective. I would say it makes more sense to it in the autocrats. module.

468
00:59:14.530 --> 00:59:16.969
Timo Glastra: Do you also think that? Or

469
00:59:18.380 --> 00:59:28.760
Ariel Gentile: I for me it it will be the same, because we will need to to instance both an oncress module and an oncress Eros module.

470
00:59:29.710 --> 00:59:36.129
Ariel Gentile: So, using the configuration in one or another, it will something that will we be always

471
00:59:36.940 --> 00:59:41.159
Ariel Gentile: it will be on this, on the same constructor in in in the end.

472
00:59:43.200 --> 00:59:44.900
Timo Glastra: Yeah. yeah.

473
00:59:45.380 --> 00:59:53.099
Timo Glastra: I think the default failure is true. So probably most people won't have to deal with this config option ever

474
00:59:58.940 --> 01:00:03.060
Timo Glastra: anyone has an opinion on this. I I see we're over time. So

475
01:00:04.360 --> 01:00:09.540
Timo Glastra: anyone has like from objection or like agreement for either of the 2.

476
01:00:14.840 --> 01:00:21.560
Clecio Varjao: Yeah, I it again to we. I've identified this. This is really, I don't think we are

477
01:00:21.890 --> 01:00:28.039
Clecio Varjao: where they need this to go. It's just a matter of should be work out of the box.

478
01:00:30.070 --> 01:00:36.639
Clecio Varjao: But if you have any orientation guidance, yeah, please. provide us a comment. And I can talk to Jason about it.

479
01:00:56.930 --> 01:00:59.390
Timo Glastra: Okay. I think, yeah.

480
01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:08.390
Timo Glastra: both are fine for me. So I think your approach is is is good to me as well.

481
01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:21.839
Timo Glastra:  okay. Let's well, yeah, we're out of time. I think we almost got to all of the Pr's except for

482
01:01:25.120 --> 01:01:31.639
Ariel Gentile: yeah, the the in in memory recreation. It. It's a very simple one. It's okay.

483
01:01:31.800 --> 01:01:35.609
Ariel Gentile: It's just to to to fix the issue that

484
01:01:35.690 --> 01:01:38.539
Ariel Gentile: Charles, Found some time ago

485
01:01:38.790 --> 01:01:41.810
Ariel Gentile: that we cannot use the in in memory

486
01:01:41.890 --> 01:01:43.709
Ariel Gentile: wallet for Ascar.

487
01:01:45.110 --> 01:01:50.119
Timo Glastra: Okay, I'll take a look at it and review it.

488
01:01:50.300 --> 01:01:51.080
Ariel Gentile: Okay.

489
01:01:51.990 --> 01:01:52.700
Timo Glastra: perfect.

490
01:01:53.500 --> 01:01:58.010
Timo Glastra: All right. Thanks. Everyone for joining today. And

491
01:01:58.270 --> 01:02:16.059
Timo Glastra: I'll see you or or I'm at a vacation next week. So yeah, I'll post in discord. Maybe somebody else will take over. But I think we'll just cancel for next week, because there's like less going on these these weeks either way. So then we can just skip the the meeting for a week.

492
01:02:16.440 --> 01:02:17.540
Ariel Gentile: All right.

493
01:02:18.530 --> 01:02:20.399
Timo Glastra: Alright. thanks to Ron.

494
01:02:20.540 --> 01:02:23.300
Timo Glastra: You'll see later, right.
