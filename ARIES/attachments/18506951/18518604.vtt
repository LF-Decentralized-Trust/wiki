00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:14.199
Kim Ebert: Today's meeting cancelled.

2
00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:19.550
Charles Lanahan: I was wondering that myself.

3
00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:31.119
Jakub Koci: yeah, I'm just writing them almost like, if if it's happening today. So let's see.

4
00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:50.990
Timo Glastra: good afternoon, everyone.

5
00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:56.810
Timo Glastra: Can you hear me?

6
00:07:56.980 --> 00:07:58.530
Warren Gallagher: Yes, I can. Hello!

7
00:07:58.950 --> 00:07:59.860
Timo Glastra: Hello!

8
00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:02.270
Timo Glastra: I'm sorry.

9
00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:05.129
Timo Glastra: Forgot about the time completely.

10
00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:11.439
Timo Glastra: I was working on the afgh, and very deep, deeply focused.

11
00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:31.559
Timo Glastra: We could be making an agenda, and then we can get started right away.

12
00:09:03.250 --> 00:09:04.720
Timo Glastra: All right.

13
00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:19.789
Timo Glastra: That's good. Start. long number on today are some Javascript for group call of July 20 need to remind you to remember the hypothesis of Connect and the trust policy.

14
00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:34.130
Timo Glastra: if you would like to add yourself to the tennis list. Feel free to do so. but it's like in the chat.  so

15
00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:40.239
Timo Glastra: yeah, any status updates from the we had a called 2 weeks ago.

16
00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:43.290
any status updates you would like to share?

17
00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:55.510
Warren Gallagher: There was a an Aries working group call yesterday and

18
00:09:56.190 --> 00:10:04.350
Warren Gallagher: the discussion mostly focused around. some work that's been done on marketing copy

19
00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:12.009
Warren Gallagher: and the results of a survey that we're informing that marketing copy So when there were links in the

20
00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:20.299
Warren Gallagher: in the meeting notes to the survey results and to that marketing copy proposal. So if anybody wants to go and look at those

21
00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:27.729
Warren Gallagher: they're available. I think the intent is to make apply

22
00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:37.549
Warren Gallagher: the changes to the main wiki sooner rather than later, and then iterate on it as necessary to try and get some of the benefit of the rework. That's been done.

23
00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:42.810
Warren Gallagher: That's number one. And there was also a presentation given

24
00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:46.540
Warren Gallagher: on Aries Vcx.

25
00:10:46.780 --> 00:11:00.519
Warren Gallagher: which is a a library written in rust that uses a whole bunch of the other rust libraries to provide a bunch of the areas functionality?

26
00:11:01.050 --> 00:11:12.090
Warren Gallagher: the intent is not to provide a a complete batteries included agent, but rather all of the stuff that you would need to construct one, or a wallet or something else.

27
00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:24.050
Warren Gallagher: Looks like they've made good progress. And there's work underway at the moment to integrate support for Mozilla's Fi project to

28
00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:31.620
Warren Gallagher: export or describe all of the rest bindings to their primary api, so that they can be made available in other languages.

29
00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:42.449
Timo Glastra: And that's using unify or

30
00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:44.470
Warren Gallagher: yes, I believe so.

31
00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:54.340
Timo Glastra: Okay. cool. Thank you.

32
00:11:58.170 --> 00:12:00.000
Timo Glastra: Any other updates.

33
00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:05.779
Kim Ebert: the low testing framework.

34
00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:09.480
Kim Ebert: with, on, that's under the Aries Mediator Service.

35
00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:14.800
Kim Ebert: we recently use that to test over 12,000 users simultaneously.

36
00:12:16.790 --> 00:12:17.500
Timo Glastra: Cool.

37
00:12:18.190 --> 00:12:21.680
Timo Glastra: That's the soccer talk, right?

38
00:12:21.850 --> 00:12:29.269
Kim Ebert: No, that's the load testing underneath the area's we need your service. I'll drop a link in the chat.

39
00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:30.890
Timo Glastra: Okay.

40
00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:53.529
Timo Glastra: okay? And this is a a test you have run to to test mediator load, and you had 12,000 concurrent open sessions. Or.

41
00:12:54.220 --> 00:13:03.140
Kim Ebert: yeah, so this is it can be used more than just a testing mediation. that has some other tests inside of it, such as issuance.

42
00:13:03.150 --> 00:13:07.840
Kim Ebert: we're also working on adding verification workflow to it as well

43
00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:10.950
Timo Glastra: cool.

44
00:13:12.950 --> 00:13:20.550
Kim Ebert: it uses Aj as the client uses a logist as the orchestrator

45
00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:36.469
Timo Glastra: cool. And so the difference with like the

46
00:13:37.130 --> 00:13:43.529
Timo Glastra: the era slow generator is that this is, one is fully focused on mediation.

47
00:13:44.290 --> 00:13:45.220
Kim Ebert: No?

48
00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:46.730
Timo Glastra: Oh.

49
00:13:46.890 --> 00:13:54.570
Kim Ebert: it started off with just mediation. we've added issuance into it. We're working on verification flow right now.

50
00:13:55.110 --> 00:14:00.360
Timo Glastra: Okay? And and do you know how it's comparison to the eras load generator?

51
00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:11.639
Kim Ebert: the Aries load generator. My understanding is that it starts up all of the services the concept here with the area's mediator services, it's focused on

52
00:14:11.790 --> 00:14:16.489
Kim Ebert:  that being a client to an existing infrastructure.

53
00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:34.659
Kim Ebert: right now the issuance and verification flows focused on an act by Api end. But I'm sure it could be modified to use

54
00:14:34.710 --> 00:14:39.460
Kim Ebert: any other issue or or verifier as long as the endpoints updated.

55
00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:46.280
Kim Ebert: because it will contact the issuer and verifier Api endpoints to

56
00:14:46.490 --> 00:14:51.760
Kim Ebert: request the connection and request the issue. Answer verification.

57
00:14:52.200 --> 00:15:01.319
Warren Gallagher: So so this is intended to be able to point at some areas infrastructure to be able to determine what its own characteristics are as opposed to

58
00:15:01.870 --> 00:15:09.910
Warren Gallagher: the load generator which sparks up its own infrastructure. And it's primarily, I guess, to test

59
00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:14.489
Warren Gallagher:  that things don't tip over.

60
00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:19.829
Warren Gallagher:  I guess that would be the primary difference in the approach.

61
00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:24.290
Kim Ebert: Yeah, the goals to test the structure. That's a existing

62
00:15:25.690 --> 00:15:26.450
Warren Gallagher: good

63
00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:28.790
Timo Glastra: sounds interesting.

64
00:15:34.270 --> 00:15:36.970
Timo Glastra: Cool any other set of updates.

65
00:15:44.570 --> 00:15:48.270
Timo Glastra: All right, I think we can get to that general

66
00:15:48.970 --> 00:16:01.149
Timo Glastra: are there specific topics? People would like to discuss on the agenda today. last time we went through. a lot of the pull requests.

67
00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:02.460
Timo Glastra: and

68
00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:13.439
Timo Glastra: so yeah, are some of the topics people would like to discuss. Otherwise we could maybe do also a quick, quick tour around to the 2 requests again. yeah.

69
00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:24.450
Timo Glastra: all right.

70
00:16:25.570 --> 00:16:32.979
Timo Glastra: let's do that. I'm not sure if there's a lot of progress being made in a lot of people. Also.

71
00:16:33.890 --> 00:16:43.260
Warren Gallagher: maybe it's covered in the in the pull requests, chemo. But I would be interested in knowing where

72
00:16:43.490 --> 00:16:48.120
Warren Gallagher: the work is in terms of supporting the

73
00:16:48.410 --> 00:16:53.979
Warren Gallagher: newest versions of like expo and react native and dependencies in the like.

74
00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:57.709
Timo Glastra: Yeah. And so

75
00:16:57.830 --> 00:17:03.410
Timo Glastra:  it was. Do you mean expo 49 then, or

76
00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:19.190
Timo Glastra: Warren. Do you mean like the latest like expo 49, or what are its meaning? Specifically.

77
00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:24.920
Warren Gallagher: I believe so. I think there was work intended to be done to get

78
00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:28.809
Warren Gallagher: like beyond react native 68 or 69. And

79
00:17:28.870 --> 00:17:35.240
Warren Gallagher: and the related expo versions I don't recall the exact version numbers. But

80
00:17:35.740 --> 00:17:42.049
Timo Glastra: okay, yeah. So that work is is completed. and

81
00:17:42.590 --> 00:18:03.350
Timo Glastra: So we haven't tested with the the latest expo version. But that came out like, I think, 2 weeks ago, or something. but I don't expect too many issues. but we have tested it with like we got it working with the latest versions, and Barrett did some very complex

82
00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:13.390
Timo Glastra: stuff to make If we go to the. for example, the adequate for us. repo

83
00:18:14.850 --> 00:18:16.700
Timo Glastra: so react native.

84
00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:34.629
Timo Glastra: It was mostly with android, I think. Yeah. So as you can see, there is now a custom logic for different direct native versions. and as you can see, it works like we have tested it up to 0

85
00:18:34.750 --> 00:18:40.529
Timo Glastra: top 71 we haven't tested it with

86
00:18:41.550 --> 00:19:00.740
Timo Glastra:  with 0 72. But that's also just came out. So I think it it. It should all just work out of the box and and everything with auto-linking and with an export project. So if you would like to have an example, is the

88
00:19:03.850 --> 00:19:07.449
Timo Glastra: paradigm wallet repo, which has an

89
00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:13.669
Timo Glastra: exco app in here, and that uses Let me see.

90
00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:34.780
Timo Glastra: it uses react native 0 dot 71. It uses the latest areas as far release. And it uses a for 0 without like native code. So I think this this you can use this as an example. If you're looking for how to set that up.

91
00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:39.110
Timo Glastra: Does that answer your question? Or

92
00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:42.419
Warren Gallagher: yes, that's great. Thank you.

93
00:19:44.130 --> 00:19:46.679
Timo Glastra: Perfect. Yeah. So, and we need to.

94
00:19:46.850 --> 00:19:53.989
Timo Glastra: Yeah, add some more documentation exactly on how to set it up. But it it should all work

95
00:19:56.140 --> 00:19:58.290
Timo Glastra: cool.

96
00:19:58.820 --> 00:20:10.109
Timo Glastra: so any Pr people would like to discuss. I haven't had a lot of time to to look at. Pr. So we discussed last time. There are some reviews I need to

97
00:20:10.590 --> 00:20:13.930
Timo Glastra: me to leave

98
00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:18.269
Timo Glastra: any Pr people would like to discuss.

99
00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:27.640
Timo Glastra: All right.

100
00:20:27.810 --> 00:20:44.820
Timo Glastra: maybe. Then there are some issues we can maybe get some consensus on one is that started in another pr, for some updating of the samples. But it's currently like with the

101
00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:47.599
Timo Glastra: the rappers that only work in

102
00:20:47.820 --> 00:21:00.260
Timo Glastra: we have native or like only a note 80. But we also support. Note 16, and it ups a lot of complexity. Is that we

103
00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:29.090
Timo Glastra: make the rappers only support. Note 18. Because they basically already do we? add to pets? Pipes. Rep not be to those wrapper. So you don't have to do the custom resolutions anymore. And we update A of J to only support. Note 18. And we drop support for note 16, which is a bit ahead of the end of life, which is in September. But I think it would make the setup a lot easier and and improve performance. So

104
00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:31.630
Timo Glastra: I'm curious if people are.

105
00:21:32.010 --> 00:21:39.100
Timo Glastra: if someone is like against dropping support for node 16. So this will be

106
00:21:39.980 --> 00:21:46.610
Timo Glastra: in 0 point 5 because like, it would be a break and change. So 0 point 4 will

107
00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:48.760
Timo Glastra: keep support for note 60,

108
00:21:48.810 --> 00:21:50.840
Timo Glastra: then for

109
00:21:53.330 --> 00:22:05.810
Denver Naicker: item, I was only successful in launching the Aries Workshop, Demo and A, as well as running through the tutorials of hyper ledger areas. Javascript.

110
00:22:05.910 --> 00:22:17.069
Denver Naicker: By using Node 16 on Linux and Wwsl to windows. Linux. I tried Node 18, and it gave me a lot of errors.

111
00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:23.279
Denver Naicker: so I'm not for doing away support for node 16,

112
00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:29.839
Denver Naicker: partly because of a lot of troubleshooting and blockages that are experienced.

113
00:22:31.340 --> 00:22:34.040
Timo Glastra: Okay, so

114
00:22:34.770 --> 00:22:38.559
Timo Glastra: did. Have you opened an issue for that? Or

115
00:22:40.650 --> 00:22:49.079
Denver Naicker: I have not, because I was successful with getting it running on. Note 16. I can't log in issues for no to 18. Then.

116
00:22:49.540 --> 00:23:00.160
Timo Glastra: Yeah, if you could do that, because usually what we do is when a note version reaches end of life, we will remove support for it.

117
00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:23.510
Timo Glastra: either way, so that would be in September, which is like not that much in the future. So if we can get that addressed that would be great. There are like. There may be some issues with the the Linux sub shell on windows where it's not working. Are you running it with in the SDK, or with

118
00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:31.960
Denver Naicker: So I just Npm installed based on the tutorials based on the documentation.

119
00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:34.630
Denver Naicker: And that didn't work.

120
00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:44.380
Denver Naicker: So it it was just using the. There is Javascript online documentation. there was no mention for Indiosk or prerequisite.

121
00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:47.770
Timo Glastra: Okay, so are you still on 0 dot 3.

122
00:23:49.310 --> 00:24:00.249
Denver Naicker: I'm I'm I I downloaded the 0 point 4 0 Repository, and I the workshop Demo, the one that was hosted last week, and I ran that successfully.

123
00:24:00.390 --> 00:24:04.800
Denver Naicker: but I think the older tutorials might be 0 point 3.

124
00:24:05.010 --> 00:24:08.489
Denver Naicker: I don't think it's 0 it. It was the latest, actually, because

125
00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:11.350
Denver Naicker: it's based on the documentation online.

126
00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:27.569
Timo Glastra: Okay? Yeah. n, then I think you're you're using the latest, especially if you also followed it from the workshop. So yeah, then please open an issue, and then we'll take a look, and then we'll make sure that that is resolved before we remove support for

127
00:24:27.890 --> 00:24:31.550
Timo Glastra: before we drop support for node. 16

128
00:24:43.460 --> 00:24:54.240
Timo Glastra:  it's called windows sub shell for Linux, or something. Right?

129
00:24:54.870 --> 00:24:57.490
Denver Naicker: Yeah, that was Wsl to.

130
00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:00.449
Denver Naicker: Yes, it's

131
00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:02.870
Timo Glastra: okay.

132
00:25:10.450 --> 00:25:12.759
Timo Glastra: what's your use? Name on Github

133
00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:17.989
Denver Naicker: Dnaiker. 86. DNA, I. C

134
00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:22.519
Denver Naicker: DNA, it's

135
00:25:22.830 --> 00:25:24.580
Timo Glastra: Can you post in chat?

136
00:25:25.340 --> 00:25:26.900
Denver Naicker: Yes. Okay.

137
00:25:55.980 --> 00:26:01.599
Timo Glastra: Okay. Any other concerns with dropping support for node. 16.

138
00:26:12.850 --> 00:26:13.550
Timo Glastra: Okay.

139
00:26:19.170 --> 00:26:19.910
Timo Glastra: okay.

140
00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:22.210
Timo Glastra: perfect.

141
00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:31.210
Timo Glastra:  okay.

142
00:26:31.930 --> 00:26:33.670
Timo Glastra: There was.

143
00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:37.189
Warren Gallagher: So I just have one other comment, I guess, which is

144
00:26:37.420 --> 00:26:41.820
Warren Gallagher:  Do we know whether this will create a problem for

145
00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:44.880
Warren Gallagher: the bifold for folks who are

146
00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:53.499
Warren Gallagher: primary cause, all actually, they, they're not using the node version. Anyways, right? They're using react native. So I guess it doesn't apply.

147
00:26:54.770 --> 00:27:00.849
Timo Glastra:  no, so it doesn't apply. I think

148
00:27:01.220 --> 00:27:14.160
Timo Glastra: we no, we I think we just. We need to make sure that we set the engine version on on the the at our framework. Slash notes package, and then it shouldn't be an issue.

149
00:27:14.410 --> 00:27:15.350
Warren Gallagher: Perfect.

150
00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:23.510
Timo Glastra: all right. There was also a discussion on

151
00:27:24.860 --> 00:27:27.830
Timo Glastra: breaking out to Demo.

152
00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:32.110
Timo Glastra: I think.

153
00:27:33.850 --> 00:27:40.610
Timo Glastra: yeah, this I I just need to comment on like something. But I think it's not controversial.

154
00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:48.029
Timo Glastra:  are there

155
00:27:48.110 --> 00:27:59.089
Timo Glastra: any other issues people would like to discuss, or would like to work on address that we need to discuss?

156
00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:01.809
Timo Glastra: I see there is

157
00:28:03.090 --> 00:28:09.829
Timo Glastra: a didn't qualify. Did migration update? This is something that's being discussed in the

158
00:28:10.330 --> 00:28:17.139
Timo Glastra: the errors working group calls to be able to migrate from legacy dates to

159
00:28:17.350 --> 00:28:22.660
Timo Glastra: qualified dates. we already have a customer implementation that goes from

160
00:28:22.710 --> 00:28:26.529
Timo Glastra: didn't qualify to get pier one days.

161
00:28:26.990 --> 00:28:33.150
Timo Glastra: and I think with this, with this we just have to update all the in

162
00:28:33.310 --> 00:28:49.739
Timo Glastra: all the did pier. One dits. We have migrated from the unqualified D to now get pier 2, and this pier 3 ditch We did store all the Still the legacy did did the commence, so would be a migration

163
00:28:49.770 --> 00:28:55.150
Timo Glastra: a script that we have to write. I think we can get that into

164
00:28:55.380 --> 00:29:12.519
Timo Glastra: 0 5 0. that does raise the question on whether we should change the default, it bare. No, I go. That is used for creating connections. So currently.

165
00:29:12.870 --> 00:29:13.790
Timo Glastra: we

166
00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:28.169
Timo Glastra: in the data exchange protocol, we use this pair one because  for data exchange, you need to attach the date documents to

167
00:29:28.620 --> 00:29:43.009
Timo Glastra: to the did exchange message and then sign that a problem is with the pair. To do that you don't necessarily have a did document because you resolved it based on the

168
00:29:43.060 --> 00:29:57.469
Timo Glastra: You resolve it based on the the date itself. So  and I think we had race started this discussion in the As working group call. But we never came to a very concrete

169
00:29:57.490 --> 00:29:59.170
Timo Glastra: decision.

170
00:29:59.300 --> 00:30:10.709
Timo Glastra: how do you handle it? If you don't have to do documents, you you attach the did document either way, so like just to resolve the document and and sign that So

171
00:30:11.060 --> 00:30:13.120
Timo Glastra: yeah,

172
00:30:13.260 --> 00:30:14.580
Timo Glastra: should we

173
00:30:14.690 --> 00:30:23.140
Timo Glastra: change the default? That pair methods? If you add this? Or are we going to use? Did pier one for did exchange and

174
00:30:23.340 --> 00:30:32.520
Timo Glastra: migrate all the legacy? dates to? Did pair to slash 3? Does anyone have no being on this.

175
00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:52.019
Warren Gallagher: I guess there would be a need to have agreement across the Aries projects.

176
00:30:52.460 --> 00:30:55.220
Warren Gallagher: in terms of did it? You know the

177
00:30:55.370 --> 00:30:57.210
Warren Gallagher: did exchange right.

178
00:30:57.840 --> 00:31:01.589
Warren Gallagher: I don't know. It's a a decision we can make in isolation. So

179
00:31:02.130 --> 00:31:15.030
Warren Gallagher:  I'm not sure that I have an opinion on it. But it is still on the agenda within the areas working group. And so if we need like, it sounds like it's

180
00:31:15.210 --> 00:31:21.330
Warren Gallagher: getting time to get serious about finalizing that stuff. So maybe you can raise it higher

181
00:31:21.450 --> 00:31:24.620
Warren Gallagher: priority on the agenda for the next meeting.

182
00:31:25.060 --> 00:31:30.559
Timo Glastra: Yeah. So I I think the one thing

183
00:31:30.830 --> 00:31:42.720
Timo Glastra: that isn't currently talked about, and that's the like. The the did exchange protocol. not having very clearly defined how to use non.

184
00:31:43.030 --> 00:31:57.400
Timo Glastra: did pier one date. So whether it's public dates or like dates that you can't move based on the or they documents that you can resolve based on the debt.

185
00:31:57.530 --> 00:31:59.260
Timo Glastra: I think there is maybe

186
00:31:59.340 --> 00:32:06.569
Timo Glastra: an issue open in ours. Rfc, and there is the let me see.

187
00:32:07.950 --> 00:32:13.189
Timo Glastra:  yeah, there is a

188
00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:19.190
Timo Glastra: legacy that this one? Yeah.

189
00:32:21.330 --> 00:32:26.679
Timo Glastra: so this repo is there. I think the idea is now to migrate this

190
00:32:27.110 --> 00:32:30.430
Timo Glastra: transformation script.

191
00:32:30.630 --> 00:32:42.239
Timo Glastra: to go from like a legacy date to a did pair 2. And I think, Steve, and added support for it. Pair 3 so I think with that

192
00:32:42.370 --> 00:32:45.100
Timo Glastra: we are

193
00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:50.059
Timo Glastra: mostly there in having the yeah, the the

194
00:32:52.270 --> 00:32:53.889
Timo Glastra: the process to find.

195
00:33:15.410 --> 00:33:18.739
Warren Gallagher: So I guess that then comes down to

196
00:33:21.250 --> 00:33:24.579
Warren Gallagher: Do we want to go with the most recent stack?

197
00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:26.010
Warren Gallagher: Or

198
00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:34.189
Warren Gallagher: do we want to go with something that might achieve wider compatibility with folks who haven't gone there yet?

199
00:33:34.650 --> 00:33:35.699
Warren Gallagher: I don't know.

200
00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:39.060
Timo Glastra: Yeah,

201
00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:45.659
Timo Glastra: so I think what they are suggesting. Also in the committee coordinated updates,

202
00:33:45.670 --> 00:33:47.730
Timo Glastra: is that

203
00:33:48.270 --> 00:33:51.610
Timo Glastra: you need to support?

204
00:33:51.700 --> 00:34:03.459
Timo Glastra:  Let me see. Yeah, I think, because it's a community recorded update, there will be quite a long period.

205
00:34:04.130 --> 00:34:08.020
Timo Glastra:  the process where.

206
00:34:09.050 --> 00:34:13.749
Timo Glastra: let me see, you work to step in one step. One is.

207
00:34:19.030 --> 00:34:24.149
Timo Glastra: So I think, what is Step one here? I think it's to support.

208
00:34:36.690 --> 00:34:37.429
Timo Glastra: Huh?

209
00:34:37.909 --> 00:34:40.260
Timo Glastra: this is, here's the

210
00:34:40.630 --> 00:34:43.110
Timo Glastra: okay. So we need to

211
00:34:43.500 --> 00:34:50.409
Timo Glastra: Agent Bill must update all agent code bases and deployments to accept in all in qualified and new forms.

212
00:34:51.420 --> 00:34:53.199
Timo Glastra: during this step

213
00:34:53.739 --> 00:34:56.780
it must continue to be in qualified

214
00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:00.299
Timo Glastra: it's in all cases.

215
00:35:02.950 --> 00:35:05.420
Timo Glastra: Yeah. So what I'm

216
00:35:06.150 --> 00:35:08.700
Timo Glastra: uncertain about

217
00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:09.820
Timo Glastra: is

218
00:35:13.250 --> 00:35:15.859
Timo Glastra: that it says it should that

219
00:35:16.220 --> 00:35:29.199
Timo Glastra: 18 builders must update all agent code base in deployment to use only fully qualified dates. Now, communication. And does that also include the connection protocol? Because in that case,

220
00:35:30.110 --> 00:35:37.899
Timo Glastra: it probably gonna be very complex, because, like it has been implemented a few years ago, like, it's fairly, it's using old

221
00:35:37.910 --> 00:35:53.800
Timo Glastra: way of structuring. And they documents. Well, that pair 2 uses a new one. So currently, how we implemented in A Ofj is we use just to unqualified exchange, and then internally, we translate it into a qualified identifier and use that

222
00:35:54.140 --> 00:35:58.460
Timo Glastra:  Well, I think this is just in

223
00:35:58.480 --> 00:35:59.520
Timo Glastra: to

224
00:35:59.590 --> 00:36:07.200
Timo Glastra: oh, use the pair to, or did your tree everywhere, even in creating a connection. For example,

225
00:36:08.050 --> 00:36:12.180
Timo Glastra: do. Is anyone involved in in the discussion share and know more about this? Or

226
00:36:18.020 --> 00:36:22.989
Warren Gallagher: I've only been peripherally involved? And so I don't feel equipped to

227
00:36:23.450 --> 00:36:33.970
Warren Gallagher: like, make any definitive statements about this. this seems to have been driven more by Stephen Kerr and Sam.

228
00:36:35.020 --> 00:36:35.720
Timo Glastra: Okay.

229
00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:44.970
Timo Glastra: I'll leave a comment on this pr, with these questions, then but then, yeah, it should be quite easy for us to to

230
00:36:45.470 --> 00:36:52.699
Timo Glastra: follow whatever is is described here. and and get that implemented while still supporting the

231
00:36:52.730 --> 00:36:59.570
Timo Glastra:  The old ways of doing things without breaking backwards compatibility.

232
00:36:59.650 --> 00:37:03.580
Timo Glastra: because I don't think we should. It's like.

233
00:37:04.120 --> 00:37:06.029
Timo Glastra: I don't think it's

234
00:37:07.070 --> 00:37:22.709
Timo Glastra: like, if we do this like updating everything to use. Only fully qualified. D, it means we're gonna break so much backwards compatibility with all implementations that have been made over the years and maybe are not gonna adopt this So it would be good if we can have a bit more of a like

235
00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:26.360
Timo Glastra: gradual. if you

236
00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:34.759
Timo Glastra: to support qualified, let's do that. Otherwise. we'll keep using the the and qualified ones. directly.

237
00:37:38.970 --> 00:37:39.770
Timo Glastra: Okay.

238
00:37:41.620 --> 00:37:45.950
Timo Glastra:  are there any other

239
00:37:46.610 --> 00:37:52.049
Timo Glastra: future issues people would like to to discuss here? Or

240
00:37:52.340 --> 00:37:53.450
Timo Glastra: right?

241
00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:10.039
Timo Glastra: Okay, then I think we can just

242
00:38:10.380 --> 00:38:16.259
Timo Glastra: got the meeting short for today. and we can.

243
00:38:16.460 --> 00:38:20.809
Timo Glastra: yeah, continue with work on the Prs and and issues.

244
00:38:20.970 --> 00:38:30.439
Timo Glastra:  one thing. I do want to. Highlight is.

245
00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:34.490
Timo Glastra: I see your unmute yako, do you want to say something? Or.

246
00:38:34.820 --> 00:38:45.700
Jakub Koci: Yeah, yeah, yeah, a good catch. I just wanted to rise. My hand, not the yeah, yeah, you you are. First. yeah. I have a question.

247
00:38:45.930 --> 00:38:59.529
Jakub Koci: We don't have to discuss it now. But about it, it's it's about the migration to the Afj, like like 2 new libraries Afskar or media, or an ongrad.

248
00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:05.029
Jakub Koci: Is there any any documentation about that and a ma

249
00:39:06.050 --> 00:39:13.950
Jakub Koci: any description about about some pain points, or or like a tricky part which we should be aware of.

250
00:39:14.670 --> 00:39:23.409
Timo Glastra: So there is the migrating from 0 to 3 to 0 4

251
00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:28.330
Timo Glastra: which introduced to break and change this. And there.

252
00:39:29.050 --> 00:39:34.099
Timo Glastra: Listen. It's migrating from India to gay wallet to

253
00:39:34.270 --> 00:39:35.290
Timo Glastra: so

254
00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:46.130
Timo Glastra:  That's there. One thing that we haven't documented very well is the migration from

255
00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:58.209
Timo Glastra: in the SDK to in the vdr or in the SDK to an of credits or s, so like the changes in the Api are

256
00:39:58.380 --> 00:40:09.220
Timo Glastra: covert here, so like that you now have to register on them credits module, but they should see. This still uses the in the SDK module here. But there is

257
00:40:09.670 --> 00:40:20.460
Timo Glastra: in the agent setup. It does define like, okay, how do you use the the In the Cdr module and configure it with different lectures?

258
00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:25.519
Timo Glastra: so that's the documentation, there is

259
00:40:25.970 --> 00:40:32.100
Timo Glastra: but no specific like these are pain points or something, to be aware of

260
00:40:32.820 --> 00:40:36.779
Jakub Koci: okay, yeah, sounds good sounds good

261
00:40:37.650 --> 00:40:52.320
Jakub Koci: I'm just thinking, I I I I know that the actually I asked the Oh, Baron, the or like Ariel on the on their presentation about Aj for version 0 for 0 point 4

262
00:40:52.380 --> 00:40:53.949
Jakub Koci: about this. And

263
00:40:54.490 --> 00:40:58.880
Jakub Koci:  my question was, Will.

264
00:40:58.970 --> 00:41:07.680
Jakub Koci: If like. if if we should migrate everything at once, or if there is a specific process.

265
00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:12.570
Jakub Koci: if if there is better, if there is some some process which might be better.

266
00:41:13.070 --> 00:41:21.160
Jakub Koci: And what I mean is that we we have like 0 point 3 right now with in the SDK, right? So now it's a question like

267
00:41:21.170 --> 00:41:24.059
Jakub Koci: I. I remember that

268
00:41:24.230 --> 00:41:28.980
Jakub Koci: it should be maybe better to do everything at once. but

269
00:41:29.630 --> 00:41:43.179
Jakub Koci: I think that he also mentioned some, that there were some issues, probably with some part. But I'm I don't remember that the that? What? What exactly I mentioned? Do you have a do you have an a do you know anything about that? Or

270
00:41:43.910 --> 00:41:59.670
Timo Glastra: I think, we have done mostly everything at once. Also what we did in the by fault and some other projects. We are just doing it all at once, because we would like to get rid of the in the SDK as soon as possible.

271
00:41:59.830 --> 00:42:24.630
Timo Glastra: But you can do it in 2 steps like you could do first upgrade 204 and use the in the SDK still. And then at another point, you could do the upgrade to Eras Offscar, for example, when 0 5 releases, or whenever you're ready for it. So it are 2 separate migrations you can do. We have just chosen to do it at once. if you don't have

272
00:42:24.630 --> 00:42:45.180
Timo Glastra: in the SDK wallet to migrate Jet, so haven't released your wallet to the stores. For example, I would definitely recommend to do it all at once, because then you don't have to do the Indians K to Oscar migration, because that does require like we have do this in the

273
00:42:45.250 --> 00:43:05.470
Timo Glastra: in the Bible products. And it does require you to have like an custom package you need to on every agent started. Basically, you need to do a check like, okay, while I previously, and in the SDK wallet? If so, I now need to migrate it and and do that to an Oscar structure, because, like the database is completely different. So we really have like to

274
00:43:05.590 --> 00:43:17.899
Timo Glastra: make a connection to the postcres. Database create new tables, move to structure, decrypt everything, re-encrypt. So like, if you can get away with not having this package.

275
00:43:17.900 --> 00:43:42.390
Jakub Koci: Yeah, I would say, sure to it all at once. Yeah, in our case, we have it already out there. So it's it's already in. We we already. We already did the migration from the Vcx. like library to have, just as you know. But there was also not only it was also not only about like frameworks, but also our data. So we are in this migration to in the SDK,

276
00:43:42.610 --> 00:43:51.779
Jakub Koci: yeah. And now it seems that we will have to do this migration with with those libraries. But I I think it's great that there, if there is some

277
00:43:52.910 --> 00:44:04.139
Jakub Koci: let's call it script right to to do this migration. yeah, that's that's definitely great. So I I hope that it should be fine.

278
00:44:05.030 --> 00:44:09.259
Timo Glastra: Yeah, it's not that complex. I can send you the

279
00:44:10.080 --> 00:44:15.399
Timo Glastra: I think it's the the implementation from the by folks.

280
00:44:16.060 --> 00:44:19.300
Timo Glastra: let me see. yeah. So

281
00:44:19.510 --> 00:44:22.330
Timo Glastra: basically, this

282
00:44:23.530 --> 00:44:32.149
Timo Glastra: is it. where it checks, is it? migrated to ascar? And if not, there is a custom

283
00:44:32.530 --> 00:44:36.150
Timo Glastra: method implementation here. That's

284
00:44:36.280 --> 00:44:42.809
Timo Glastra: calls this in the SDK to ask our migration update.

285
00:44:55.030 --> 00:44:57.580
Jakub Koci: Okay, cool. Cool. That's great. Thanks.

286
00:45:00.340 --> 00:45:02.630
Timo Glastra:  Marvin.

287
00:45:04.500 --> 00:45:18.039
Warren Gallagher: Yeah, I I seem to recall so so 2 things. One. Another thing that came up in the Aries call yesterday is that Steven current is pushing towards officially deprecating in the SDK.

288
00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:30.949
Warren Gallagher: and they'd like to do it sooner rather than later, and so is is trying to rally everybody to to do that. So just as a point of interest is that he wants to move, and the SDK to

289
00:45:31.060 --> 00:45:39.450
Warren Gallagher: archived state as soon as possible. so I don't know whether that goes into your decision about your migration path and the and the like. Just so, you know that's

290
00:45:39.540 --> 00:45:47.400
Warren Gallagher: happening. And if you have concerns with that. Then you should chime in and get in touch with Steven, and you know, let him know what your concerns are.

291
00:45:48.020 --> 00:46:01.999
Warren Gallagher:  And the other thing. The only thing I seem to recall as being an issue, and it may have been resolved, but with the migration was, if with Afj, and as far as if you were using multi tenant.

292
00:46:02.060 --> 00:46:13.719
Warren Gallagher: I think there was that that's not supported in the current migration. But I might be incorrect about that. So I just wanted to bring that up as a question in case that's something that is German in here.

293
00:46:14.530 --> 00:46:16.350
Timo Glastra: Yeah, it it.

294
00:46:16.410 --> 00:46:42.459
Timo Glastra: It isn't in command of jets like we need to do proper migrations for multi. Tennessee needs to be implemented. Still, anyway, it is something we are going to implement because we are using multi-tenancy with a in 0 for 0. we haven't written the migration for multi tenancy, and no just completely yet, for Uscar is because we don't know anyone that is using

295
00:46:42.610 --> 00:46:48.400
Timo Glastra: it's a multi-tenancy in production. And so

296
00:46:48.430 --> 00:46:51.360
Timo Glastra: I added, to like the

297
00:46:51.430 --> 00:47:06.990
Timo Glastra: the dogs and everything. There are some warnings in like, Hey, multi, tenancy is not supported. if you need it, please open an issue. But I don't. Didn't want to go through all the trouble and complexity if nobody is ever going to need it.

298
00:47:10.180 --> 00:47:20.009
Timo Glastra: yeah. So if you are using multi, Tennessee are on 0 3 within the SDK, and you are in prediction and need to migrate it to

299
00:47:20.630 --> 00:47:44.579
Timo Glastra: us guard, and please open an issue, and then we can look at getting that implemented But, for example, we have mediators running with in the SDK in 0 3, and we have successfully migrated those to 0 for and updating indie to uscar so for that use case yeah, it. It works fine. But yeah, you're right. That that is

300
00:47:45.040 --> 00:47:46.440
Timo Glastra: not implemented that.

301
00:47:53.880 --> 00:47:55.439
Timo Glastra: okay?

302
00:48:03.120 --> 00:48:08.339
Timo Glastra: Or the deprecating the in the Fk, yeah, it might be a good one to discuss. also.

303
00:48:08.420 --> 00:48:15.909
Timo Glastra: I'm in favor of it. I think it adds complexity to this project to also have to support it.

304
00:48:16.250 --> 00:48:23.439
Timo Glastra: And the installation is like very cumbersome. also for newcomers.

305
00:48:24.060 --> 00:48:25.080
Timo Glastra: so

306
00:48:25.350 --> 00:48:31.070
Timo Glastra: yeah, I'm I'm totally on board with deprecating the in the SDK. Maybe what we

307
00:48:32.610 --> 00:48:52.949
Timo Glastra: to do is already start adding notes to like we have for we have in the like experimental modules. We have warnings like, Hey, this is experimental. Maybe we could also start adding, like, Hey, this is going to be deprecated. looks warning looks, and then maybe

308
00:48:53.420 --> 00:48:56.429
Timo Glastra: we say we remove support, for

309
00:48:56.510 --> 00:48:59.049
Timo Glastra: in the SDK in either

310
00:48:59.830 --> 00:49:16.360
Timo Glastra: zero-five. But maybe we should set it for 0 6 release, so people can still do one more upgrade within the SDK to 0 5. But then in zeros dot 6, we will remove support for the in the SDK and

311
00:49:16.580 --> 00:49:44.459
Timo Glastra: if people are really interested in keeping support for it, then that would still be possible, because, like, it's currently there's no logic in core to support in the SDK. But I would then suggest that from 0 6 onwards we remove it out of the the, the errors from a Javascript repository, and there could be, like a custom maintained implementation outside of it, if you really need in the sk But then yeah, I think that would provide the

312
00:49:45.310 --> 00:49:47.939
Timo Glastra: clear migration that I can.

313
00:49:49.150 --> 00:49:55.450
Kim Ebert: Yeah, If you have a clear migration path here, it'd be good to let Steven know kind of the timeline.

314
00:49:55.590 --> 00:50:10.890
Kim Ebert: because one of the things that came up was removing some of the build artifacts from the repositories to encourage no longer using in the SDK, and so having a timeline on that would be helpful for

315
00:50:10.940 --> 00:50:18.620
Kim Ebert: Steven to know what a good time would be to remove those build artifacts from various repositories.

316
00:50:20.700 --> 00:50:32.160
Timo Glastra: Yeah. And so built artifacts. Because I think we're moving built out of fox can mean that current deployments can break. Is that something we want?

317
00:50:32.230 --> 00:50:33.730
Timo Glastra: I think my my

318
00:50:33.750 --> 00:50:39.880
Timo Glastra: prefer to approach would more likely be to like not update it anymore. So if you have, like an older

319
00:50:40.130 --> 00:50:42.290
Timo Glastra: deployment, it doesn't suddenly

320
00:50:42.370 --> 00:50:44.220
Timo Glastra: break

321
00:50:47.400 --> 00:50:49.720
Kim Ebert: the concern there is

322
00:50:49.770 --> 00:50:53.240
Kim Ebert: deploying artifacts that aren't maintained anymore.

323
00:50:53.880 --> 00:51:01.940
Kim Ebert: so if there's security holds or things like that. And so at some point.  having the

324
00:51:03.110 --> 00:51:07.269
Kim Ebert: artifacts deployed out, there can be more of a liability than they are a benefit to anyone.

325
00:51:10.310 --> 00:51:12.030
Timo Glastra: Yeah, that makes sense.

326
00:51:12.750 --> 00:51:24.279
Warren Gallagher:  I think the the the thing that would require some communication with Steven, then, is

327
00:51:24.340 --> 00:51:40.130
Warren Gallagher: about a a prospective plan. for you know you you mentioned, perhaps you know, deprecated putting in deprecation warnings and removing support in 0 5 0, or maybe in 0 6 0. And so if we have an idea of

328
00:51:40.160 --> 00:51:42.560
Warren Gallagher: you know what

329
00:51:42.960 --> 00:51:53.270
Warren Gallagher: what you would desire to do there, and what the timelines are, you know, at at best, guess at that point for this release, then, that could inform

330
00:51:53.490 --> 00:52:02.980
Warren Gallagher: some of the other stuff that that Steven and others are doing to try and wrangle the in the SDK to the ground. Just make sure we're coordinated on that stuff.

331
00:52:04.880 --> 00:52:05.570
Timo Glastra: Yeah.

332
00:52:05.880 --> 00:52:07.689
Timo Glastra: yeah, it makes sense.

333
00:52:19.510 --> 00:52:26.269
Timo Glastra: Are people, any people here that are using any sk and don't intend to upgrade to

334
00:52:26.600 --> 00:52:31.409
Timo Glastra: Iscar and related libraries for 0 5 or even 0 6.

335
00:52:44.250 --> 00:52:48.279
Timo Glastra: Okay, well, that's a positive, at least.

336
00:52:49.460 --> 00:52:50.230
Timo Glastra: okay.

337
00:52:52.220 --> 00:53:11.189
Timo Glastra: cool Then, final note is, I think I also mentioned this last time. already, I'm not 100% sure, because it's 2 weeks ago already, and notification in between. So I but all my memory from before

338
00:53:11.190 --> 00:53:26.909
Timo Glastra: but that we wanted to switch hosting the A Ofj call to being bi weekly because there is like with current things that are happening. I think having a by weekly call would be good enough.

339
00:53:26.960 --> 00:53:33.190
Timo Glastra: And if there well. in the

340
00:53:33.260 --> 00:53:47.649
Timo Glastra: so much to discuss that we can do it in in the the buy would be called, and we can always go back to having weekly calls. But I think a lot of this stuff can also be picked up in issues and full requests.

341
00:53:47.980 --> 00:53:49.150
Timo Glastra: any people

342
00:53:49.170 --> 00:53:55.120
Timo Glastra: against that here today that's that would like to keep it at a weekly call. People that are

343
00:53:55.350 --> 00:53:59.860
Timo Glastra: agreeing of the bi-weekly call or have any opinions notes on this?

344
00:54:04.530 --> 00:54:12.599
Jakub Koci: I I think it definitely makes sense during the summer occasions. Right? maybe. Let's see again on

345
00:54:14.520 --> 00:54:28.349
Jakub Koci: in September or in autumn and the the so does it mean that we would skip next week and do it in a 2 weeks again.

346
00:54:28.540 --> 00:54:31.259
Jakub Koci: another call would be like, in 2 weeks from now.

347
00:54:31.940 --> 00:54:33.150
Timo Glastra: Yeah, exactly.

348
00:54:36.510 --> 00:54:37.780
Jakub Koci: Okay. Good.

349
00:54:41.010 --> 00:54:44.100
Timo Glastra: Okay. I I think. oh, yeah, correct.

350
00:54:45.270 --> 00:54:48.999
Denver Naicker: Sorry, Tim, I I I just. This is my first meeting.

351
00:54:49.290 --> 00:54:52.750
Denver Naicker: and I thoroughly enjoyed it. There's a lot of insights.

352
00:54:53.080 --> 00:54:58.219
Denver Naicker: and I'll I'm a bit sad, and if it goes to sort of

353
00:54:58.240 --> 00:55:07.140
Denver Naicker: further away, further away from, you know the consistency by weekly, is it? Every 2 2 times a week, or then twice every second week.

354
00:55:07.520 --> 00:55:12.069
Timo Glastra: Yeah. So it would be once every 2 weeks, 2 times a month. Basically.

355
00:55:14.550 --> 00:55:27.150
Denver Naicker: Okay. cause I I've been away. I haven't. I also desperately looking to be more involved in the community. And this is my first meeting, and I, you know, thoroughly enjoyed it. So

356
00:55:27.300 --> 00:55:30.059
Denver Naicker: it'll be with T on my clock.

357
00:55:30.610 --> 00:55:31.290
Timo Glastra: Okay.

358
00:55:31.510 --> 00:55:37.470
Timo Glastra: no, that's good to know. I think. Yeah.

359
00:55:37.480 --> 00:56:04.069
Timo Glastra: I we have done it like for weekly, I think for really long time already. I think it at first was bi weekly. I just think with the conversations we have lately. maybe it's something for the summer months. And then we can always reconsider it after the summer months. or if there are enough topics to do it weekly.

360
00:56:04.230 --> 00:56:08.810
Timo Glastra: That would also be fine by me. But I think

361
00:56:09.460 --> 00:56:20.769
Timo Glastra: we can also. yeah, we should have probably some more like we have in the past that that's a bit like doing alternating weeks of having a maintainer and a

362
00:56:21.050 --> 00:56:34.320
Timo Glastra: users call, basically where one week will be really focused on in-depth. discussions on the implementation. The other one would be more focused on.

363
00:56:34.390 --> 00:56:42.479
Timo Glastra:  the on the user side of things having people give presentations.

364
00:56:42.540 --> 00:56:52.770
Timo Glastra: what have they built with Asj? What can you do with it? And more from a user perspective? and I notes that I haven't had a lot of time

365
00:56:53.110 --> 00:57:05.630
Timo Glastra: lately to prepare well for the working group calls. And I think that's also one of the reasons why I would like to move it more to a by weekly call.

366
00:57:05.870 --> 00:57:13.630
Timo Glastra: Because, yeah, having people to present on these things with presentations and everything. I think that helps in making it more.

367
00:57:13.780 --> 00:57:21.669
Timo Glastra: So a a better working group call I have also discussed a bit with

368
00:57:22.070 --> 00:57:38.170
Timo Glastra: yeah, Koop and Aliel and cream and parent and asks to maybe do it a bit more in alternating fashion where we host the working group calls I think that that could maybe also help a bit.

369
00:57:38.340 --> 00:57:41.549
Timo Glastra: but yeah, I'll definitely take it into account.

370
00:57:41.560 --> 00:57:53.790
Timo Glastra: I would like to propose for now to at least for the summer. Do it by weekly. And then, as Jack upset after the summer, we can reconsider to to see like, okay, what's the interest? And do we want to make it

371
00:57:53.890 --> 00:57:57.029
Timo Glastra: weekly or by weekly.

372
00:57:58.560 --> 00:58:03.429
Timo Glastra:  yeah. And so if you have topics, you would like to

373
00:58:04.150 --> 00:58:12.200
Timo Glastra: present and or talk about on on the desk call presentation or something like that. also, please

374
00:58:13.690 --> 00:58:18.230
Timo Glastra: raise that to us. and then we can have those on the working group calls

375
00:58:20.470 --> 00:58:22.129
Timo Glastra: for a you unmute it.

376
00:58:24.200 --> 00:58:29.110
Warren Gallagher: Yeah, I just wanted to say, I I think that the you know that

377
00:58:29.390 --> 00:58:35.470
Warren Gallagher: the cadence of the calls doesn't matter personally to me as as much one way or the one way or the other.

378
00:58:35.590 --> 00:58:39.980
Warren Gallagher: but I will say that I think the last few months have been

379
00:58:40.030 --> 00:58:42.120
Warren Gallagher: very

380
00:58:42.160 --> 00:58:48.980
Warren Gallagher: busy for the project, because there's been so much both refactoring of the framework

381
00:58:49.080 --> 00:58:59.219
Warren Gallagher: as well as a lot of rework due to moving to shared components, and those 2 things have taken a lot of coordination, and I think have needed the the cadence of the calls

382
00:58:59.370 --> 00:59:16.230
Warren Gallagher: to to maintain the velocity and coordinate those complex activities. And so I'd like to pass on some congratulations, I think, to the group to for managing that like, there's a very complicated set of things to to get to and deliver, and I think it was done pretty well.

383
00:59:16.410 --> 00:59:30.000
Warren Gallagher: and so if for the next little while it. You know, people need a a break from that. And there's a lot more, you know, independent work that can happen. That doesn't require as much coordination. Then, you know, perhaps
