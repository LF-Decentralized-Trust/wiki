10:06:45	 From Dinesh Srinivasan : No concerns here
10:19:24	 From Akiff Manji : Is the idea here to have component level i18n?
10:19:28	 From Akiff Manji : Rather than a global one?
10:19:40	 From Akiff Manji : Component encapsulated
10:24:39	 From Akiff Manji : Ok I think I can see now the purpose behind the interface then
10:24:55	 From Akiff Manji : That could add a further layer of decoupling from i18n
10:25:41	 From Akiff Manji : I think we should have a11y by default
10:31:48	 From Dinesh Srinivasan : +1 for responsive design to cover tablets.
10:32:50	 From Akiff Manji : With the ability to disable
10:32:57	 From James Ebert : +1 ^
10:40:54	 From Dinesh Srinivasan : Woot woot that would be amazing.
10:41:58	 From Dinesh Srinivasan : Will the native binaries also be included in the npm packages? Or do we still manually need to add them to the android and iOS directory.
10:42:21	 From Mostafa Gamal : You will have to add them
10:43:01	 From Dinesh Srinivasan : üëç
10:43:30	 From Akiff Manji : I would assume that would be somewhat of a democratic process?
10:44:11	 From Tim Bloomfield : Ontario would need to become more engaged in the PR review process - something that we are not doing now and should be
10:47:28	 From Mostafa Gamal : +1 with Json suggestion
10:47:49	 From Dinesh Srinivasan : +1 ^
10:52:59	 From Akiff Manji : My only issue is do we care if there are duplicate entries?
10:53:07	 From Akiff Manji : Less an issue and more a question
10:55:42	 From Akiff Manji : What about interpolated values?
10:55:49	 From Akiff Manji : I would avoid them
10:56:05	 From Akiff Manji : Unless necessary
10:58:13	 From Dinesh Srinivasan : Just curious, will the new framework support *.svg images? Currently images can only be *.png.
11:05:54	 From Timo Glastra : For Indy SDK we use this Expo plugin: https://github.com/animo/indy-sdk-expo-plugin
11:06:40	 From Timo Glastra : Maybe Bifold could also use Expo? You don't have to use their cloud services, but their prebuild command (which you can run yourself) is amazing!
11:07:34	 From Akiff Manji : What was the initial issue with us using Expo?
11:08:16	 From Timo Glastra : Catering to too much can also be problematic. Sometimes opinions are good üôÇ
11:09:14	 From Dinesh Srinivasan : https://github.com/animo/indy-sdk-expo-plugin - does it support IOS?
11:10:26	 From Timo Glastra : Yes iOS and Android
11:10:46	 From Dinesh Srinivasan : Neat.. IOS simulator as well?
11:10:54	 From Timo Glastra : Sadly, no üôÅ
11:11:00	 From Dinesh Srinivasan : Uh oh
11:11:14	 From Jason Leach : Danesh, won‚Äôt work because you can‚Äôt use the iOS camera simulator for QR codes.
11:11:29	 From Dinesh Srinivasan : Duh!
11:11:57	 From Dinesh Srinivasan : Ty ty
11:12:20	 From Mostafa Gamal : We cannot use Expo so far, we already started customizing some native components per iOS/Android
11:14:27	 From Akiff Manji : I would say whatever makes it easier for users to setup the project, why not?
11:15:20	 From Mostafa Gamal : But then you are limiting major sector who are already bootstrapping in cli mode
11:15:56	 From Akiff Manji : I meant we provide multiple paths
11:16:05	 From Akiff Manji : But that might be a lot of overhead
11:16:07	 From Mostafa Gamal : Ah okay, makes sense
11:16:52	 From Dinesh Srinivasan : +1 for storybook
11:17:00	 From Mostafa Gamal : Have to drop, will follow up with the recording
11:17:56	 From Akiff Manji : Lets also talk about test coverage since were on that topic
11:20:44	 From Timo Glastra : Have to drop. Great session, lot's going on!
11:30:07	 From Akiff Manji : I think the core question we should ask is how we incorporate testing and how deep?
11:35:39	 From Akiff Manji : Can we also set up a roadmap of how we move through this process?
11:39:48	 From Jason Leach : aries-bifold-framework
11:39:53	 From Ryan Koch : ^
11:46:00	 From Dinesh Srinivasan : An alternative name recommendation:
aries-bifold-core
aries-bifold-native-libs

And in the future.. (prefix - `aries-bifold-*`):
aries-bifold-ui
etc,etc
