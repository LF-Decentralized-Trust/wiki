00:36:43	Stephen Curran:	Timo - idea for unqualified to peer DID 3 â€” canonicalize unqualified DIDDoc to peer DID 2, and then to peer DID 3.  That should workâ€¦
00:42:22	Timo Glastra:	Interesting idea Stephen, If we have the did:peer:2 did we could directly move to did:peer:3. Seems trivial to support did:peer:3, but not sure if numalgo 3 is going to solve the lack of implementations we have for numalgo 1 (in the end it's making a hash on a JSON object, which isn't too different from method 3). If we have a consistent did:peer:2 did, we could also transform that in a did:peer:1 did instead
00:47:08	Dr. Andre Kudra:	You are probably aware of this website of LF:https://www.linuxfoundation.org/projects/digital-trust
