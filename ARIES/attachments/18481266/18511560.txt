00:51:43	Alex Blom:	ZKP?
00:51:52	Kyle Den Hartog:	Zero knowledge proofs
00:52:38	Kyle Den Hartog:	It’s a generic form. In the Indy implementation, we use the Anoncreds implementation which supports zero knowledge proofs for credentials.
01:31:13	Alex Blom:	+1
01:36:51	George Aristy:	Hey Sam... I still don't understand why the Phone Agent's DIDDoc can't have a serviceEndpoint pointing to the Routing Agent
01:38:27	Vipin Bharathan:	Shall we call this eventual end-point
01:39:11	Oliver Terbu:	+1
01:39:16	Tobias Looker:	George it can, Phones did doc it shares with AnyAgent will feature the endpoint of routing agent. But the question is what does the endpoint look like the did doc the phone shares with the routing agent
01:40:56	Kyle Den Hartog:	We’re at 2:32pm by the way.
01:41:50	Oskar van Deventer (TNO):	Let's put DIDCom-over-XMPP at the top of next week's agenda, and the Peer DID update as second agenda point.
01:42:02	Kyle Den Hartog:	That sounds like a good idea
01:42:43	Tobias Looker:	+1 interested to hear your proposal oskar
01:43:17	Oskar van Deventer (TNO):	Tobias, all, please see DIDCom-over-XMPP here: https://github.com/Oskar-van-Deventer/indy-hipe/tree/didcom-over-xmpp/text/didcom-over-xmpp
01:43:30	Tobias Looker:	Thanks!

01:44:05	Oskar van Deventer (TNO):	Signing off now, it is getting late in Europe. Bye!
