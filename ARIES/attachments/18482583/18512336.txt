00:17:13	Richard Esplin:	I am in favor of skipping the call next week.
00:17:18	Steve McCown:	+1 for skipping the meeting during IIW.
00:18:02	Andrew Whitehead:	Is indy-node 1.10.0 still due this week?
00:18:44	Richard Esplin:	Yes, but it is a reduced scope: refactoring and bug fixes, but no PBFT view change.
00:19:20	Richard Esplin:	We are considering delaying the release until next week in order to include support for Ubuntu 18.04. We need an estimate on when that work will finish.
00:19:49	Andrew Whitehead:	Good to know
01:44:02	John Callahan:	Sounds like “stable” vs “edge” when mixing new versions
