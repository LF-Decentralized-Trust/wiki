00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:29.389
Patrik Stas: Well, hello! There! And welcome to 2022 December 15, Eric. We Seex community call fellow. Listeners.

2
00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:36.019
Patrik Stas: so As for today, it's gonna be again pretty short. Update, I suppose.

3
00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:43.789
Patrik Stas: so since last week we had only one Pr. Merge from

4
00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:45.789
Patrik Stas: J. I. J. 3 P.

5
00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:54.099
Patrik Stas: and that was the support for reading that. did did key format to keys.

6
00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:03.369
Patrik Stas: this has been merged yesterday. And basically. Now this is addressing issue.

7
00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:09.159
Patrik Stas: I think we should link it. so it's easier, more easily accessible.

8
00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:12.260
Patrik Stas: I think it's among the close one

9
00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.389
Patrik Stas: and no, no, no, no, no no

10
00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:18.069
Patrik Stas: supported key.

11
00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:22.059
Patrik Stas: yeah, this is where I here

12
00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:25.710
Patrik Stas: so let me just post it there.

13
00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:44.329
Patrik Stas: yeah. So this is addressing the Rsc. 0, 3, 6 0 which adds support for the bit key for

14
00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:49.400
Patrik Stas: party for now particular LED 2, 5, 5, one on keys.

15
00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:56.890
Patrik Stas: there was a good comment from George, pointing out, there's other open source repo

16
00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:59.409
Patrik Stas: by the centralized identity.

17
00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:02.630
Patrik Stas: organization.

18
00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:15.999
Patrik Stas: we just particularly focus on a date key. However, this also brings more dependencies, and actually is able to perform like a whole bunch of other things like it can do, signing.

19
00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:30.670
Patrik Stas: verifying. So it includes the crypto in it, whereas what we actually added here we'll simply explain conversion of LED 255 and she's

20
00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:37.970
Patrik Stas: It was a conversion of the did key into the, you know.

21
00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:41.740
Patrik Stas: in the in the

22
00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:47.970
Patrik Stas: make it naked key, as they call it, in the Rc.

23
00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:52.000
Patrik Stas: yeah. So that's that.

24
00:06:54.980 --> 00:07:11.900
Patrik Stas: And next up we have few items in programs. so we got a cool pr from Middle fall very cool. so this is basically new agent implementation

25
00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:16.609
Patrik Stas: in the in the role of the Cli agent

26
00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:25.040
Patrik Stas: so I haven't played with with this myself. But, we should enable to control

27
00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:29.319
Patrik Stas: control on Aries agent from

28
00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:43.640
Patrik Stas: I is the 6 base. See our agent from Cili. So create connections. We see credentials and stuff like that. It's pretty huge. I suspect that a majority of these lines might be just cargo.

29
00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:48.749
Patrik Stas: cargo, log file or something like that. but nevertheless it's

30
00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:52.299
Patrik Stas: It's still fairly big. Pr

31
00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:56.449
Patrik Stas: but it's currently in a draft status. So

32
00:07:56.470 --> 00:08:00.130
Patrik Stas: let's say it's ongoing at 4.

33
00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:12.590
Patrik Stas: Yeah, it's it's. It's apparent that most of the lines coming in here are from the cargo log. It's not a terribly a lot close to review, so that should be. That should be

34
00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:17.380
Patrik Stas: easy. well, let's see how how many lines will end up with

35
00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:18.530
Patrik Stas: once. This is

36
00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:21.560
Patrik Stas: switch to the ready status

37
00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:41.929
Patrik Stas: next up small update about the Aries. Ask for what it. So this is something George, from our own labs has taken taken over at this effort. however, as for the last messages I received from him and from his to the update on

38
00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:51.309
Patrik Stas: this court. he's he's still facing the issue with some dependency conflicts.

39
00:08:51.760 --> 00:09:03.219
Patrik Stas: Once you try to add the Ari's Us car dependency to Vcx. There's conflicts between us car and Vdr. Tools.

40
00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:08.199
Patrik Stas: I promised how promising to look at this

41
00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:19.770
Patrik Stas: but I didn't really made the progress there. So, Paul, just for that, George. I think the upcoming week until the next

42
00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:30.689
Patrik Stas: next meet up. I might have been more time to focus on on the so hopefully I can. I can help to unlock this

43
00:09:30.890 --> 00:09:32.300
Patrik Stas: issue.

44
00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:48.340
Patrik Stas: lastly, no, Js: If I this is being stopped for a while. about As as I mentioned, I might have more time myself this week. So probably gonna take this over and

45
00:09:48.730 --> 00:09:59.620
Patrik Stas: I suppose. to have a clear distinction, and to avoid any. If 5 conflicts live Vcx created in it in a first stage.

46
00:09:59.630 --> 00:10:12.770
Patrik Stas: a liberty 6 create in its current form might be split into 2 crates separating out the handle so-called handle. And the see if a file layer and then

47
00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:32.509
Patrik Stas: in the next stage i'll simply add a new node jess sort of libby 6 implementation we would hook directly into the the handles layer of Lou Vcx, and therefore preventing any sort of symbol conflicts.

48
00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:49.810
Patrik Stas: yeah, but no breaking changes for existing wipers. So it's gonna be just sort of internal restructuring even possibly splitting into crates. But shouldn't shouldn't come with any breaking changes whatsoever.

49
00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:56.200
Patrik Stas: the lastly, just to go over, and some new task and new tasks.

50
00:10:56.820 --> 00:10:57.970
Patrik Stas: which came up

51
00:11:00.170 --> 00:11:17.870
Patrik Stas: with the Pr. with with the did Cpr. we brought in a new dependency to project Bs 58 and via by but by a closer look, it's apparent that this these libraries

52
00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:35.120
Patrik Stas: clearly superior superior to the one we are using currently as it's much faster. And also Bs 58 have pretty much no dependencies except for like one optional.

53
00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:43.799
Patrik Stas: Yeah, there is one optional dependency. But so this is pretty cool because rust the raw space, 58 has

54
00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:52.910
Patrik Stas: a bunch of dependencies which is using so, and and this can help actually preventing, or perhaps and solving

55
00:11:52.970 --> 00:11:58.449
Patrik Stas: partially. the kind of issues

56
00:11:59.430 --> 00:12:05.970
Patrik Stas: the George is running to in attempt to integrate every s car wallet

57
00:12:06.510 --> 00:12:21.949
Patrik Stas: and then as for the new task, lastly, that this is actually been created while I go. But I don't think it was being covered. So as we merged some did soft pr's did so support prs

58
00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:28.009
Patrik Stas: we can now unlock a bunch of adh tests.

59
00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:33.710
Patrik Stas: So it just it's just matter of doing that work and and running those tests.

60
00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:35.469
Patrik Stas: testing it.

61
00:12:36.110 --> 00:12:38.790
Patrik Stas: so this is this is open, if you

62
00:12:39.570 --> 00:12:44.809
Patrik Stas: yeah, and that's that's pretty much it

63
00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:48.449
Patrik Stas: I restructured this

64
00:12:49.370 --> 00:12:52.840
Patrik Stas: I restructured this page a little bit, so I put a

65
00:12:53.240 --> 00:13:03.880
Patrik Stas: I put the task back log aside. So these are the sort of long term the the tasks, future tasks which has been identified in the identified in line

66
00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:06.190
Patrik Stas: previous calls.

67
00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:13.610
Patrik Stas: And basically next meeting, i'll move this to tasks from here over here to the backlog, and

68
00:13:13.690 --> 00:13:20.220
Patrik Stas: so we can always clearly see like what's actually new. And we don't accumulate bunch of old stuff here.

69
00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:23.789
Patrik Stas: with that being said

70
00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:37.129
Patrik Stas: we are coming closer and closer to Christmas. so we weather in in Europe. so in your December and i'll be looking forward for the next week. Cheers.
