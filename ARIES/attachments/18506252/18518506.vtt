1
00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:47.850
Alex Metcalf: Good morning.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:01:02.850
Helen Garneau: hey? Can you have 1 s? I am trying to set somebody else up on a different meeting. So just gonna go on mute, but feel free to welcome folks as they come in.

3
00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:04.099
Alex Metcalf: Yeah.

4
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.849
Alex Metcalf: I shall be a couple of minutes. We saw that here.

5
00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:29.840
Sean Mouton: And actually, I'm gonna pop out and then come back. So if you guys, Alex, you want to

6
00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:37.220
Helen Garneau: get started or just hang on 1 s, that's I'll I'll be back.

7
00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:57.110
Alex Metcalf: Okay? Sorry about that.

8
00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:08.789
Helen Garneau: Perfect, very efficient. Everyone. Okay. So opening up the meeting.

9
00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.630
Helen Garneau: agenda.

10
00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:17.070
Helen Garneau: Oh, yeah, for July 20, fifth, perfect.

11
00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.899
Helen Garneau: Let me share my screen.

12
00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:45.400
Helen Garneau: Awesome. Well, welcome everybody to the Aries marketing working group. Call for July. We meet once a month to discuss every, all things. Marketing related to Aries, and hope to have more kind of voices and thoughts and ideas

13
00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:55.179
Helen Garneau: kind of emerge as we move forward and kind of updating and refreshing. the messaging and kind of public facing content and inscriptions for Aries.

14
00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:05.099
Helen Garneau: If you want to add your information to this, let me. I think I can just put the link in the chat.

15
00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:13.499
Helen Garneau:  and so again, my name is Helen Darnell. I'm from in DC, Alex, would you like to introduce yourself.

16
00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:18.419
Alex Metcalf: Yeah, Alex. Smith, of working with coming to British Columbia.

17
00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:30.949
Helen Garneau: and shaun I know we've crossed pads. Can you remind me what we are going to do. Oh, yes, Shaun Tom from Epsa, South Africa.

18
00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:38.469
Sean Mouton: I heard about this last week. Now, for the life of the I can't remember it told me.

19
00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:54.270
Helen Garneau: okay, well, welcome. yeah. We have been talking a little bit about this group and the formation of this group over the last couple of months. in the the regular areas working group call. So you might have heard it

20
00:04:54.380 --> 00:05:24.300
Helen Garneau: talked about there. but yeah, we did a little work in our last meeting. talking about how to describe Aries, what elements that we needed? to kind of hear from the community about. So we I had created a survey to receive some of those, some information, just some opinions about kind of what's missing and what we should be doing. And we got those survey results back. And Alex has done a beautiful job kind of

21
00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:36.719
Helen Garneau: formulating all of those, all that feedback and all our conversations into a deck. Alex, would you like to share your screen and just present, and we could talk about what we have what you have.

22
00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:47.189
Helen Garneau: Yeah, absolutely. Give me 2 min here. I don't know to miss this. I can see it

23
00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:50.929
Alex Metcalf: often. The sided presentation thing where you.

24
00:05:51.300 --> 00:06:05.149
Alex Metcalf: He stands side in front of people, and it feels like an age. But it's actually quite a long time. We will start to get uncomfortable way long, and it feels like when you're presenting playing with that when I'm doing presentations. All right, we share this window up here.

25
00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:06.419
Helen Garneau: There was a

26
00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:33.680
Helen Garneau: a person named Nathan George, who was one of the first kind of leaders of the working group, calls from Indy, and and who was at sovereign and Now he's at Kiva, I believe, and he would say, Oh, does anybody have any comments or questions? And he would like he. He would give a solid minute, or like 90 s of like, wait time before he would move on, and so we called it a Nathan like a unit of so that's where that's what a Nathan is.

27
00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:37.290
Alex Metcalf: That's wonderful. okay, here we go.

28
00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:52.660
Alex Metcalf: how you know this, but they're recording to show them as well. And that's don't you? What we did and what we found here. These are the results. Obviously we put out about 3. Come on 3 weeks ago, now, running for a couple of weeks, promoting the various places various

29
00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:58.479
Alex Metcalf: the working group. And you put on the email list the Hyper Ledge discord Server.

30
00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:01.879
Alex Metcalf: Then if your organizations got 16 responses back.

31
00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:06.290
Alex Metcalf: which is to say, this is not in any way a statistically valid.

32
00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:15.120
Alex Metcalf: So the results it's more of indicative items like, you know, if you just see one prompting comment to open up a new avenue of thinking, which is what it did.

33
00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:25.500
Alex Metcalf: So should be taken with that. We haven't got any. We purpose in recording the demographic information about the people, all their employment, and so forth. So we also know the skew of this. There could be some really great opinions out there about

34
00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:37.359
Alex Metcalf: Aries, and it's important features that are not reflected here. But with all those caveats set we got some good things out of it. So just recap the results now. and just talk about the rather than dive into the actual numbers.

35
00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:49.310
Alex Metcalf: We had a like a question out of the gate from not important to very important. The 5 point scale about how important people think Ares features are to a business person, and we gave them a whole bunch to choose from.

36
00:07:49.430 --> 00:08:02.100
Alex Metcalf: Now this is to get a sense of how we want to prioritize how we write about Aries, because from some questions we asked in the working group, going back about 2 months now, each person has a different

37
00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:19.200
Alex Metcalf: summary of what they thought was important, but areas, how they describe it. So we'll say, Okay, is it? Is it that it's for identity solutions? Is it the is privacy? preserving important? What about the fact? You can make wallets with it if you want to have that note right up front. Is that not clear? How about it's future proof all these kind of things.

38
00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:26.270
Alex Metcalf: So these are the bar graphs that where they skew high to the right-hand side, that means more support. With this queue high to the left it means less support.

39
00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:31.140
Alex Metcalf: apart from the first very first call, which is how they use, which is that don't no answer.

40
00:08:31.530 --> 00:08:36.309
Alex Metcalf: So most of these results in line with what we thought identity solutions being the strongest

41
00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:47.310
Alex Metcalf: people looking for the application for identity. So that makes a ton of sense. It's good to have that backup complete toolk a lot to support, using other credentials for high blue bar there, like W. 3 C. Credentials.

42
00:08:47.470 --> 00:09:01.549
Alex Metcalf: mixed response, which is interesting to me about wallets and agents in that. we thought there might be. I thought there might be more people saying, yes, it's really important. You say, right up front. You can make your own agents with this to do A, B and C,

43
00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:14.169
Alex Metcalf: that may be important. This is not again the whole community. They are surprised not to see that when they hire. So it's like, Okay, it's not. And putting these lower doesn't mean we're not going to talk about them. It means you may not talk about them as probably right up front.

44
00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:20.039
Alex Metcalf: So I think those are the main takeaways from this is that

45
00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:28.119
Alex Metcalf: Wallace and agent would as important as saying, You can apply this for identity. You can apply this, and it has

46
00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:30.230
Alex Metcalf: of multiple credential support.

47
00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:33.609
Alex Metcalf: I only the one that was negatively against people saying we don't.

48
00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:39.299
Alex Metcalf: the response, saying, we don't really care that it doesn't require blockchain. That wasn't the high priority feature

49
00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:46.340
Alex Metcalf: that may have applicability to a mark in the misunderstanding. There's been some talking in in the EU about these aspects, but

50
00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:49.690
Alex Metcalf: in terms of priority, features response that wasn't one of them.

51
00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:57.790
Alex Metcalf: So then we have. I'll go to these, these, these results, and a bit more detailed to the the working group last week, and I'll leave some space in the

52
00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:08.160
Sean Mouton: on. So on. The create agents is is that in relation to

53
00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:19.420
Sean Mouton: is that it? The people you spoke to already have agents talking to the ledges that they require?

54
00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:27.720
Alex Metcalf: we don't have that information, but my, from from doing a lot of survey work. My interpretation is.

55
00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:30.999
Alex Metcalf: it's not important.

56
00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:39.130
Alex Metcalf: when talking to a business person, to mention what it's an agents upfront. They're more trust in the solution it provides rather than the.

57
00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:47.990
Alex Metcalf: So then we asked the same questions again, but we asked the person that there was. We asked respondents, what about to developer.

58
00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:59.259
Alex Metcalf: and these are much more apart from wide, as mentioned. All the same things apply apart from the feelings of the charts. Open source. Yes, I open stand it? Yes, huge support, multiple. I just that kind of makes sense.

59
00:10:59.430 --> 00:11:00.450
Alex Metcalf: And

60
00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:19.620
Alex Metcalf: again, the same trends to the business people applied to developers. So that's kind of interesting steer that, you know. We'll still mentioned solutions that involve walls and agents, and we'll still mention the fact that It doesn't require a lot chambers like to put that, you know, as high priority in a hierarchy of things. You tell people when you first introduce them to areas. If we will come to in a minute.

61
00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:26.579
Alex Metcalf: We ask them any other suggestions of things that are important to mention.

62
00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:40.279
Alex Metcalf: some good, some good things came up. These are more like, you know, prompting food for thought items. what's the conformity like for existing standards? how about for government level density? And Kyc needs.

63
00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:46.470
Alex Metcalf: What's the time to mark how you know? Where is this ready to go? Do you have to build top of what? What's it come with?

64
00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:59.089
Alex Metcalf:  cryptography. Who's is it being externally reviewed by a you know, with the pie all this kind of things. So this is interesting list to come back to as we evolve how we describe our areas.

65
00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:06.530
Alex Metcalf: a lot of these I hadn't thought about before in the first summary, and hadn't been prompted by talking to the community about it. It was good to get these responses.

66
00:12:08.890 --> 00:12:13.109
Alex Metcalf: and then we had a free text question, saying, You know, go out, or what else we missed

67
00:12:13.390 --> 00:12:42.249
Alex Metcalf:  with that couple with the free, the the free text. We asked people to give us a whole bunch of materials that they thought would be great for people starting news areas. So we also respond this, if you, you know, developers can be new to this, a business. Can you use Aries, where do you send them? What's that? Bookmarks? Pdf, you like? What's that video that course we got a whole bunch of suggestions which we've collated? And we'll put onto a first pass of a getting started section.

68
00:12:42.270 --> 00:12:48.219
Alex Metcalf: And with all that areas materials. And we can refine this. And the idea is that we're going to build a community. Well, this is not for me and Helen to try. And

69
00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:58.709
Alex Metcalf: you know, micro managers are saying, Here's a place, guys. If you have somebody you always send them. People put it here and reduce the work to everybody else. They can kind of get started. So we have about.

70
00:12:58.910 --> 00:13:02.309
Alex Metcalf: I want to say about 30 links that people provided which is very helpful.

71
00:13:03.590 --> 00:13:09.299
Alex Metcalf: feel the suggestions. it's actually comparing areas to alternatives. It's a good point.

72
00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:11.420
Alex Metcalf: Develop. FAQ,

73
00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:23.150
Alex Metcalf: that's gonna a massive on the fax using most. Send you covered off the well structure information and it becomes a bit of a a catch. It's not looked after it, but it could be fa cues about things that people often ask that we could address our right in that format. So

74
00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:24.730
Alex Metcalf: I think it's another there.

75
00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:28.799
Alex Metcalf: explanation of areas, shorter, longer versions.

76
00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:34.529
Alex Metcalf: Great idea takes work might be a community thing to contribute.

77
00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:42.550
Alex Metcalf: And then this is a good prompting question to. So we're into. I'll just finish it, as someone said. The sooner we can be the Hyper Ledger pages about Aries the better.

78
00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:44.920
Alex Metcalf: and we have some materials that just

79
00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:50.940
Alex Metcalf: daily for the launch of areas. So 2,019 more technical in nature.

80
00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:55.550
Alex Metcalf: don't reflect the latest use cases. And now, in some cases are incorrect.

81
00:13:56.170 --> 00:14:00.869
Alex Metcalf: and all those put together. a. For us to get something

82
00:14:01.190 --> 00:14:04.050
Alex Metcalf: updates as soon as possible. We can cover in a minute.

83
00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:05.280
So

84
00:14:05.730 --> 00:14:29.380
Alex Metcalf: very helpful results which basically said, I think, how do you find the same thing that we were on the right track? We want to make sure that we were not presuming something about writing my areas that the community wasn't in line with. And this is not in any way physically valid. in terms of, you know. quant analysis. we do get some some indications that we're on the right track, and how we describing this.

85
00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:41.350
Alex Metcalf: So so it's not just the Alex talking show. How do you want the bridge into how we're going to be applying this to? Do you want to show a description you've come up with, or how we're going to apply it to the formats of them.

86
00:14:41.680 --> 00:15:11.179
Helen Garneau: all right. Good. Yeah. I think if you haven't, if you have met at at at the tip of your fingers. That'd be helpful. But I'll just add that, yeah, I I I definitely want this to be a collaborative effort. And it's also going to, you know, have lots of versioning getting something out with sort of a a baseline update across the wiki across the actual hyper ledger. Ares page that pops up when you like the the highest ranked page. When when you do a search for Aries, getting those items

87
00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:22.360
Helen Garneau: refreshed and updated, and then continue to iterate, I think, is going to be the best way moving forward. I would love to, you know, see more kind of implementation

88
00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:46.069
Helen Garneau: used cases, examples of implementation. in a section I would love to have. Yeah, more video content, more contributions from the community in terms of marketing support of in terms of like white papers and longer form. You know, reading materials, I mean, all of this kind of conversation came out of The. I guess it was like 6 weeks ago now, and maybe 2 months ago, that

89
00:15:46.070 --> 00:15:59.960
Helen Garneau: They were talking about the open wallet foundation, and somebody was saying, you know, I'm out in in the community, in in business meetings with potential customers, and they want to hear about a wallet and a wallet is so important, and that's what we should talk about. We don't ever talk about waltz and Aries.

90
00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:23.880
Helen Garneau: And we're like, Yeah, then we should change it. And I think, you know, there's some opportunity to find that middle ground for Aries. if it's a community, if it's communication or messaging problems, and then we should absolutely change it. So this is that opportunity to get started. But it's by no means the the end result that we're never gonna change moving forward so hopefully, this, this we, you know, we get this update going. And then we keep moving

91
00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:32.100
Alex Metcalf: absolutely. So on the screen share in front of you. It is a draft of the content I'll position this we're going to come up with like

92
00:16:32.310 --> 00:17:00.039
Alex Metcalf: this is a like a core description of Aries as a sort of middle ish technical layer. And we're going to apply in 3 places. the landing page for the hyper ledger Wiki pages for areas. So when you come to Aries, and that's one of the main ones that comes up depending on your search engine and your hit in your search history. That could be first, the second one is the Hyper Ledger website.

93
00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:07.610
Alex Metcalf: Now, we can't update that one. Right now, I do some practicalities. We might be able to find a way a way around that. But that's because they are refreshing this site.

94
00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:22.790
Alex Metcalf: And they got a bit of a freeze on Content up place while they do that. But that's the second place, and we might lift some of this content up a little bit to be a bit more slightly more high level for that audience, and then they can link through the more details. That's the second place, you apply the concept.

95
00:17:23.130 --> 00:17:33.729
Alex Metcalf: and the third one is in the Aries main areas, Github Repo the the main reef far when you come into the repo, has got a space for an overview as well.

96
00:17:33.810 --> 00:17:54.450
Alex Metcalf: So those are the 3 core points and we can provide. I want to provide roots up where appropriate to high level information. So if there's anything more business focus. We can link up from that in the right places, and equally more likely as well, we'll go down from this. So people come from this initial Wiki page. They might go down to more technical details, needing me to link into that as well.

97
00:17:54.770 --> 00:18:02.190
Alex Metcalf: And that's where this description came from, based on draft he worked at before, based on feedback. From the survey results I just covered

98
00:18:02.210 --> 00:18:07.909
Alex Metcalf: and some feedback from the Aries working group was somebody who gave a couple of comments last week.

99
00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:17.029
Alex Metcalf: Come to this description. Here, we've got this over a general summary at the top. That's the link of where it's going to be, by the way. some key characteristics

100
00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:18.470
Alex Metcalf: what it is.

101
00:18:18.790 --> 00:18:22.709
Alex Metcalf: this is. These are the links that are provided

102
00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:41.920
Alex Metcalf: by various people. They could still be sorted. I just look at first stab of saying, these are more general, these are more, develop a techy focus. But they could be better grouping. And we can. We can iterate them. But let's get something up, because something is better than nothing. So we got these links here, and then we'll continue the format as on the existing page, except to say that

103
00:18:41.970 --> 00:18:55.240
Alex Metcalf: Helen has got this great template page that we're going to work off as a good structure for a Wiki page, and we'll probably just re purpose this con into the right places on that template page in the coming days right now.

104
00:18:55.380 --> 00:19:00.870
Alex Metcalf: So we can have that. that Wiki page update as soon as possible. So Wiki page first

105
00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:07.369
Alex Metcalf: hyper ledger site when they let us and see if we can find a way through that and then gain that repo for the

106
00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:10.629
Alex Metcalf: theories Repo updated the remedy there.

107
00:19:10.730 --> 00:19:21.450
Alex Metcalf: And now, if you do, a Google search on hyperbolic Aries, because our assumption is that people people people are typically funny. It's not by searching on. Oh, what's out there to do? Identity. And all this often do what that means.

108
00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:31.030
Alex Metcalf: But we're working on the premise, which I think it's been back to by a few people supporting us, and this is that they hear about Aries. It comes up in a conference like here in a talk, and they want to learn more.

109
00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:40.460
Alex Metcalf: So we can. The basis in this search for us by name. That's not to say some of our keywords might not hit that. But when you do that in social hybrid areas by name lose 3

110
00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:44.599
Alex Metcalf: places. Come up first. And also we're talking with this concept.

111
00:19:50.500 --> 00:20:06.240
Helen Garneau: yeah, I think that's the the an app summary. let me put the one more time, just for folks that just joined us. The link to this this meeting? the wiki and the zoom chat here one more time.

112
00:20:06.450 --> 00:20:12.620
Helen Garneau:  yeah, if you go to that, Google Dos link up that page to show you the screen share is about page

113
00:20:12.770 --> 00:20:17.360
Alex Metcalf: 2 or 3 into that document to scroll down to this as Wiki content, and then you'll see

114
00:20:17.710 --> 00:20:20.380
Alex Metcalf:  what we call there.

115
00:20:21.710 --> 00:20:29.759
Alex Metcalf: So yeah, the next step for us is, I think we have the messing good for now it's not as a final one. If some of it gets something up and that's iterated.

116
00:20:29.890 --> 00:20:32.150
Alex Metcalf: and next step is is is.

117
00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:38.839
Alex Metcalf: And this is any comments which we'd really welcome right now, next step is we're going to update that Wiki page

118
00:20:39.630 --> 00:20:45.309
Alex Metcalf: and and and and move things forward and make it, you know, much more effective as a learning page for people.

119
00:20:46.310 --> 00:20:52.500
Sean Mouton: So that that Wiki page that you just showed is that just a

120
00:20:52.570 --> 00:20:53.780
Sean Mouton: current

121
00:20:55.060 --> 00:20:57.949
Sean Mouton: version that you're looking to update.

122
00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:14.959
Helen Garneau: Oh, sorry. Here's Here's the the just, the Wiki page that I put in the comments is the one for the meeting today. the example page that the Hyper Ledger staff actually mentioned is a great model for filling out a wiki page kind of

123
00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:34.059
Helen Garneau: format for A project is this one, and it's for one of the labs called me Mini Fab and that is this link that I just put in the chat the second link there the short link and for Mini Fab and I can also share my screen.

124
00:21:35.490 --> 00:22:04.670
Helen Garneau: but this would be an example of what we're looking at in terms of updating the Ares, the current aer's page. So we'd have maybe some content at the top a like a description of what it is some of the highlights of what it does. And it's some of those value points that that Alex just had in there and then how to like, get people going quickly, how to get them, using it, contributing to it, learning about it, participating in meetings, etc. So we have all of the get started.

125
00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:11.690
Helen Garneau: Get involved items right at the top. If you have questions where to go, where the discord channel is, etc.

126
00:22:11.930 --> 00:22:17.039
Helen Garneau: I think you know, a layout similar to this is kind of what we're looking at. If you go to the Aries

127
00:22:17.540 --> 00:22:39.620
Helen Garneau: page as it stands. it has. It has a description that you know needs to be updated. it has some characteristics. and then it has a documentation repos, and then communication and chat. But I think that you know, and then, you know, calendars and stuff. But I think there's an opportunity here to kind of move things around, make it a little more user friendly, especially again, for you

128
00:22:40.430 --> 00:22:53.490
Helen Garneau: potential customers or partners or vendors who are looking to adopt Aries looking to learn about it whatever Just make it easier for them to find what they're looking for quickly depending on their level of

129
00:22:53.660 --> 00:23:02.979
Helen Garneau: knowledge or interest? Or what have you in in the project? So kind of move things around to make it a little more user friendly and update it with the the messaging that Alex just shared.

130
00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:14.000
Sean Mouton: But the description that you, if you scroll up quickly to the top. So to me this description is more of what it is, then

131
00:23:14.930 --> 00:23:17.109
Sean Mouton: what we proposing to update

132
00:23:20.060 --> 00:23:33.759
Sean Mouton: so potentially, just keeping keeping this description is what you're what you're

133
00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:38.040
Sean Mouton: for interaction as defined.

134
00:23:43.060 --> 00:23:46.140
Sean Mouton: Because if addicts brings up these description.

135
00:23:47.290 --> 00:23:58.990
Sean Mouton: It talks to more it being i digital identity ecosystem, but it's more the infrastructure that allows the to to be a interaction

136
00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:05.659
Helen Garneau:  I don't know any. Next was my view or or ease my view of what

137
00:24:06.310 --> 00:24:07.730
Sean Mouton: hey reese

138
00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:18.859
Helen Garneau: absolutely and does anybody else want to jump in and and chat. I think there's an opportunity here to have a nice yeah discussion on what other people think.

139
00:24:21.420 --> 00:24:31.889
Helen Garneau: I mean, when we kind of set out with the task of updating the language. It was through the lens of trying to

140
00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:37.459
Helen Garneau: supply a view of Aries that would be more

141
00:24:37.740 --> 00:24:39.860
Helen Garneau: understandable, palatable.

142
00:24:39.930 --> 00:25:09.440
Helen Garneau: Familiar to somebody who doesn't know anything about Aries, somebody who is a again, a potential customer or partner, or what have you? Somebody who maybe isn't technical. Who wants to? Who's a business decision maker, who's trying to decide whether or not to put money into a particular project or a particular vendor, etc. And so when I think the we had, we started asking the questions in the survey, etc., we were sort of framing it, as

143
00:25:09.660 --> 00:25:17.719
Helen Garneau: you know, there's these 2 different audiences, the business audience and the developer audience. And how can we kind of start real high level and then provide

144
00:25:17.940 --> 00:25:23.250
Helen Garneau: the links and the offshoots, and the the experience that each one of those you

145
00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:26.699
Helen Garneau: types of audiences would require.

146
00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:35.349
Sean Mouton: I don't know if you can actually get that first sentence in this technical

147
00:25:36.730 --> 00:25:37.760
Helen Garneau: sure.

148
00:25:40.190 --> 00:25:43.279
Sean Mouton: especially for a business person.

149
00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:46.979
Sean Mouton: because, I mean, this is the language we utilize.

150
00:25:47.050 --> 00:26:03.089
Sean Mouton: when communicating our business. But in all famous. We actually don't even go into the detail around Aries just due to the fact that we find it's more a technical tool. Keep them, for example, what Indies?

151
00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:04.240
Sean Mouton: So we would.

152
00:26:04.390 --> 00:26:10.190
Sean Mouton: we would have more business conversation around indie than what we would have around a

153
00:26:11.290 --> 00:26:14.910
Helen Garneau: It goes to assets. I pure

154
00:26:15.330 --> 00:26:25.170
Sean Mouton: technical tool set, same with Asia. for us, to implement the centralized

155
00:26:26.570 --> 00:26:27.880
Sean Mouton: identity.

156
00:26:28.260 --> 00:26:32.690
Helen Garneau:  I don't know how the other

157
00:26:33.170 --> 00:26:35.629
Sean Mouton: I was on the

158
00:26:35.950 --> 00:26:40.130
Sean Mouton: go see it. And if I actually have a different type of conversation.

159
00:26:51.070 --> 00:27:02.279
Helen Garneau: one of the things about that first sentence, in, or even the first, you know part of that sentence. Hyper, hyper ledger areas is an infrastructure for blockchain rooted peer-to-peer interactions.

160
00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:13.749
Helen Garneau: We have found it in this kind of conversations. In the last, you know, couple of months. that a lot of organizations don't even really want to talk about blockchain.

161
00:27:13.910 --> 00:27:29.600
It's a word that they immediately start thinking, crypto for a this a high level business decision maker it it can be. It can be a sticky word. So that was one of the items that I think had come up in one of the conversations. was just that that word. And then also

162
00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:44.859
Helen Garneau: peer-to-peer interactions. Again, if we're trying to start high level. Maybe this is a maybe this, this phrasing and this terminology can then be used you somewhere else. But peer-to-peer interactions is also something that it doesn't really spark

163
00:27:45.290 --> 00:28:01.110
Helen Garneau: the value-driven conversation. How can I implement? What? Why would I implement this? What good is it to me in my business? Why would I want to do this? Where would I? You know? Where would I implement it? And so I think part of what we were looking at is

164
00:28:01.230 --> 00:28:22.239
Helen Garneau: providing descriptions that were more again value oriented and and communicating ares as a Well, I mean Shawn, you could, or Alex, you could bring. Bring it up again. What kind of the draft that you have there? But looking at it at from a perspective, from a lens of

165
00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:37.869
Helen Garneau: if a business is putting time, resources, energy, money, developer time towards Aries. Why would they make that decision? And we're trying to answer that that question. Maybe that's not the question we should should, it should start with. I don't know, Alex, do you have any thoughts on this?

166
00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:58.019
Alex Metcalf: Yeah, I can see the value of clarifying at the right time what it actually is like. I understand that. And when we've in a parallel piece of work, the hell I doing with Dcom, we've gone more that way. It has a lower level. 10, that full value. And we actually saying, this is what it is, quick.

167
00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:01.210
Alex Metcalf: clearly out front.

168
00:29:01.430 --> 00:29:09.890
Alex Metcalf: but a is the breadth of it, like, I said, every time we ask people a different idea of what they meant. So we have gone. Just this is value based. It's it's, it's, it's your complete

169
00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:16.810
Alex Metcalf: toolkit for doing this. And let you do this and this and this. Okay? And then the thinking is.

170
00:29:17.130 --> 00:29:28.780
Alex Metcalf: Well, how's it? What, exactly is it that we dive in? You? Look at those videos, you look at those intros. You look at the okay. I get it. Now it's it's facilitates this. So I think it is important.

171
00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:39.790
Alex Metcalf: I could see potentially the value somewhere in the description in the right places, saying, You know explicitly what it is. but we have

172
00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:43.940
Alex Metcalf: so far purposely picture that bit higher

173
00:29:45.060 --> 00:29:51.359
Alex Metcalf: as to what it brings the table rather than technically what it is, especially because I think the words

174
00:29:52.590 --> 00:30:03.509
Alex Metcalf: when it's so easy when we're so in it, to think this was a common place. But when we, when you in any way like approaching, and that that first line is critical, and we sign to use

175
00:30:03.780 --> 00:30:09.009
Alex Metcalf: 4 plus to level words and get into longer technical things and

176
00:30:09.020 --> 00:30:12.630
Alex Metcalf: blockchain root and infrastructure and peer to peer. They're not.

177
00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:21.330
Alex Metcalf: We just have to find the middle ground of language. And so it's an ongoing discussion. And I really hear what you're saying, Shaun. I don't know that, because I want the exact answer.

178
00:30:21.610 --> 00:30:29.720
Alex Metcalf: The only answer is, so far is that the feedback we've had is being there, being a lot of people of of it have have not pushed back on the track we've taken.

179
00:30:30.100 --> 00:30:38.470
Alex Metcalf: So I'm wondering there's a way to have a cake, and you don't. If we can take the value basic proof you have and also have a statement. Someone say exactly what it is. Maybe there's like a

180
00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:41.630
Alex Metcalf: you know. What? What point does that become critical?

181
00:30:42.200 --> 00:31:00.579
Sean Mouton: What point does it? I would say, point of the implementation? But neither you are they the. So if if we look at the first saying, A is your complete toolkit for the same for you, when people see complete toolkit?

182
00:31:01.390 --> 00:31:07.959
Sean Mouton: Yeah. Oh, I'll take a reason. Now I can start issuing my, the that you call

183
00:31:08.130 --> 00:31:20.389
Sean Mouton: you need a components like that. You need components like a pipeline in the or depending on, you know which direction you want to take.

184
00:31:22.070 --> 00:31:25.889
Sean Mouton: If it's like your complete toolkit for

185
00:31:28.450 --> 00:31:30.080
Sean Mouton: integration.

186
00:31:31.100 --> 00:31:37.820
Sean Mouton: Because the the sentence in itself said Con, just says, guys, if you take Aries, you don't need anything else.

187
00:31:39.260 --> 00:31:41.310
Sean Mouton: That's the port that

188
00:31:43.330 --> 00:31:50.710
Tim Bloomfield: this is Tim here. Sorry I'm driving it too much noise. I I'll go back on mute.

189
00:31:50.940 --> 00:31:51.630
Tim Bloomfield: But

190
00:31:51.940 --> 00:31:57.269
Tim Bloomfield: I'm struggling with this a bit because of the areas I mean, public areas is as many different

191
00:31:58.340 --> 00:32:03.829
Tim Bloomfield: applications. We talked about the occupy as a complete tool. Kitty, you're talking A of J. Is a quick toolkit.

192
00:32:03.970 --> 00:32:11.020
Tim Bloomfield: because I could certainly don't need in the to issue credentials, some in with with some of those tools depending on what I'm doing.

193
00:32:11.170 --> 00:32:20.179
Tim Bloomfield: Others, you know I don't do so. I struggle with I I still always struggle with what is Aries in terms of the toolkit, a set of standards

194
00:32:20.340 --> 00:32:23.690
Tim Bloomfield: working code influencing a set of standards.

195
00:32:23.720 --> 00:32:30.979
Tim Bloomfield:  but I I do think it areas is an important focus. I mean, it's post I really I to me, Indian stuff is almost.

196
00:32:31.140 --> 00:32:53.269
Tim Bloomfield: There's a very few pieces left in India that are needed. but but there is, it is! It's it's it's pretty much a placing most of the pieces. The last one is a ledger, but India is a long, I mean sorry. Aries is a credential agnostic. Now, I mean noncredit, I should say so. You don't have to use indy note, for example. Anyway, I I do struggle with. I'm not sure what it is.

197
00:32:56.180 --> 00:33:14.710
Helen Garneau: and maybe there's room for modification. Instead of your complete toolkit. We we do mention an an open source code repository or the a, a, a mature code base for building to centralize, I did what dynamic solutions or something like that,

198
00:33:15.030 --> 00:33:25.949
Tim Bloomfield:  because that one thing we I, I, I always had in the back of my mind is when aries was graduated from

199
00:33:25.950 --> 00:33:50.830
Helen Garneau: or like whatever, and into graduated status. I don't know. Whatever the top level, most mature status that hyper ledger. it's because it has a thriving community. It has tons of con contributors from a bunch of different organizations. There's constantly, you know, commits and interesting things happening. And you know, it's it's I want. I want to make sure that anybody who you know comes our way and is looking at Aries

200
00:33:50.830 --> 00:33:53.379
understands that it's not just.

201
00:33:53.430 --> 00:34:04.319
Helen Garneau: you know, a bit of a bit of code that has been open, sourced, and you can pick it up and might be able to do something with it. I I want to make sure that it is very clear about the breadth and and

202
00:34:04.330 --> 00:34:28.480
Helen Garneau: depth of of the of the code, and and that the description is in line with again what somebody, what their pain point is right like, who are we serving with this top level description? And you know, at the end of the day. It's it's gonna be somebody who's putting money towards creating a a product with this. So why would they create a product with with this? And you know. Let me learn more. Right?

203
00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:37.339
Helen Garneau: So I think, starting out with, Oh, it's a code base that you know. If it's mature code base, it does. But whatever we decide, you know the word wording there and then we go into

204
00:34:37.340 --> 00:34:47.649
Helen Garneau: making peer-to-peer connections, and you know, to send you something. You know we could build. I think we can build that language into a place in a workflow

205
00:34:47.650 --> 00:34:59.439
Helen Garneau: in a kind of a you know, customer experience flow for using that. Using that language so we could, we can definitely build it in there. I don't think we have to abandon it. you know, just blankly.

206
00:34:59.590 --> 00:35:04.550
Sean Mouton: Hmm, no, it's it. It. It was more around just getting

207
00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:17.180
Sean Mouton: that appropriate view of what it is to us as a community. I mean your ongoing communication channels for reaching interaction to me, is a good replacement for

208
00:35:17.350 --> 00:35:21.129
Helen Garneau:  in, if you

209
00:35:21.570 --> 00:35:24.170
Sean Mouton: you know that business type terms

210
00:35:24.190 --> 00:35:33.770
Sean Mouton:  the the meet the requirements and regulations for government label identities.

211
00:35:37.310 --> 00:35:39.279
Sean Mouton: might be a bit of a stretch.

212
00:35:41.170 --> 00:35:48.450
Tim Bloomfield: Well, there's a couple of governments that are very keen on using it for that.

213
00:35:48.550 --> 00:35:57.359
Sean Mouton: let's call it a governance framework around it to need those regulations. It in itself

214
00:35:57.480 --> 00:35:58.729
Sean Mouton: doesn't do it.

215
00:35:58.960 --> 00:36:04.380
Tim Bloomfield: No, no, it's a to it. It's a technology stack, it's not. It's not the pieces around absolutely a great.

216
00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:18.620
Tim Bloomfield: But I still think it's the tool. It's it's a set of libraries and open source code base is mature, open source code that allow you to implement these these standards. I think that's that's a huge value proposition. I think it's earlier. It's it's very real. You got a code.

217
00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:47.070
Helen Garneau: Awesome. I have been have not taking very good notes by. Let me get back into the page, and then we'll. I'll add that those those comments in here, because it really that's what this meeting is for, right is to make sure that we aren't you know, leaving anything on the table when we go to make to then present kind of what our

218
00:36:47.250 --> 00:36:54.300
Helen Garneau: to present this to the general kind of working Aries working group. but I want to make sure. You know, we want to make sure that there is

219
00:36:54.470 --> 00:36:57.799
Helen Garneau: enough ideas. And

220
00:36:58.390 --> 00:37:04.260
Helen Garneau: yeah, enough ideas being circulated and and the in consideration, so that we are able to provide a a good

221
00:37:04.280 --> 00:37:06.200
Helen Garneau: good, you know, next steps

222
00:37:10.430 --> 00:37:19.469
Helen Garneau:  so just adding some notes into the Aries marketing.

223
00:37:19.900 --> 00:37:22.260
Helen Garneau: working group meeting. Page.

224
00:37:38.310 --> 00:37:38.990
Okay?

225
00:37:39.470 --> 00:37:49.849
Helen Garneau:  So I think that was, that was the majority of what we wanted to talk a little, you know. Talk about today. And and Alex, what do you think about

226
00:37:51.110 --> 00:38:02.630
Helen Garneau: adding, or when you, I think the idea is, the next steps is to present that deck to the working group or to the like general Aries working group. Is that right? Is that what that would be? The next steps

227
00:38:02.830 --> 00:38:08.720
Alex Metcalf: we've had. We did that summary of the deck last week. I think the next step was really about here is that

228
00:38:08.740 --> 00:38:13.770
Alex Metcalf: here's a Wiki page ready to go. I I would imagine, as well as I think.

229
00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:26.980
Alex Metcalf: if we can reflect the language of the front. So it's very clear what this is. Let me get that right. I think that feedback is really helpful. So thank you. I'm sure on, Tim on that. If we get, if we tighten that up. We will clear on that. I think. The next step is.

230
00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:31.309
Alex Metcalf: I suggest, is, let's get something improved. Let's get the Wiki page

231
00:38:31.540 --> 00:38:33.610
Alex Metcalf: improved and ready to go.

232
00:38:35.910 --> 00:38:45.530
Helen Garneau: and maybe what we do is We implement the the language from the documents that you shared into a draft, and then I send it out.

233
00:38:45.550 --> 00:38:48.010
Helen Garneau: and then we can. you know.

234
00:38:48.620 --> 00:39:07.539
Helen Garneau: add or subtract, or to, you know, change things as needed. but you know I I do. I just I really think that starting out high level, and then kind of letting it, you know, choose your own journey. If you're looking at more learning about understanding what areas is or going to, you know. Look under the hood and start seeing

235
00:39:07.540 --> 00:39:24.440
Helen Garneau: the code and the, you know, different, you know, underlying descriptions for developers. I think that there's there's room for both and and you know, being able to accommodate that in what in in the wiki, and you know, with offshoots, I think, is the best

236
00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:40.640
Helen Garneau: course of action. So whether or not we keep that sort of the same Aries language higher up or further down, it will be there. so I think it's just a matter of who that most appeals to. But we could definitely move things around as we go

237
00:39:43.610 --> 00:39:44.510
Alex Metcalf: for sure.

238
00:39:47.610 --> 00:39:52.899
Helen Garneau: Cool And you put all those links to those 2 documents in the chat. Is that right, Alex?

239
00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:54.610
Alex Metcalf: They put

240
00:39:55.380 --> 00:39:59.320
Alex Metcalf: the we have been there. No, I didn't put the

241
00:39:59.390 --> 00:40:01.799
Alex Metcalf: the the the Google top link to that

242
00:40:02.980 --> 00:40:05.500
Helen Garneau: update description. 1 s here.

243
00:40:07.130 --> 00:40:08.910
Helen Garneau: Yeah, maybe I'll just. I'll drop in.

244
00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:11.790
Helen Garneau: That's

245
00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:24.270
Helen Garneau: the yeah. We just want to drop in. The survey results deck that you showed. And then I think I rate. And I made it deleted the the link that I we had in there and then the area, the one that you had just

246
00:40:24.700 --> 00:40:25.640
Helen Garneau: presented.

247
00:40:29.110 --> 00:40:35.849
Sean Mouton: I just the question, are we going to be looking at the training material as well, because I see these,

248
00:40:37.620 --> 00:40:44.679
Sean Mouton: of course, and invert the commerce that covers, I believe, to Aries, Indies, and Montreal.

249
00:40:45.730 --> 00:40:49.809
Helen Garneau: It's after the Linux Foundation training.

250
00:40:49.880 --> 00:40:59.890
Helen Garneau: that is a good question. the Aries community did not make that training material. Specifically, I think, like Steven Current wrote it. Maybe.

251
00:41:00.140 --> 00:41:15.040
Helen Garneau:  of hyper ledger. Yeah, something like that. So we could, we could out. Yeah, we could approach even about it, you know, if he's working on any updates, or if we could, you know, review any of that material.

252
00:41:15.370 --> 00:41:22.489
Alex Metcalf: I think he's been updating it over the years. As as things are going. It keeps refreshing it from what I remember hearing anecdotely so

253
00:41:24.340 --> 00:41:29.430
Helen Garneau: awesome. so yeah, maybe I'll I'll try to grab that

254
00:41:29.610 --> 00:41:43.409
Helen Garneau: Talk to Stephen about how how to best present that maybe I grab him for our next meeting. He can join us, and we he could talk, walk through the the training and certification materials. Because you're right. That's that's definitely a a first step, you know, in a lot of people's journeys. For sure.

255
00:41:47.040 --> 00:42:08.719
Alex Metcalf: I feel like I went through it. It was like free for a minute, and I went through it. But it was years ago. Shawn, did. Have you ever gone through it in any iteration, or Alex, have you gone through it

256
00:42:08.900 --> 00:42:15.380
Helen Garneau: back in the day? I think it's $180, or something to that effect

257
00:42:16.570 --> 00:42:19.650
Helen Garneau: for the certification or for the the just, the training.

258
00:42:19.900 --> 00:42:25.650
Helen Garneau: Okay? Yeah. So the the

259
00:42:26.980 --> 00:42:38.070
Helen Garneau: just the workshop, like the work, the training is free. So you can access and see the questions and everything you know the content there. But what you're saying is, you'd like to see the certification questions. Is that what you're asking for?

260
00:42:38.430 --> 00:42:48.980
Sean Mouton: No. So it yeah. The E, as we update the material. Yeah, and give that to business

261
00:42:49.370 --> 00:43:04.450
Sean Mouton: view of what as is Steven kind of to me needs to take that wording and included in the training course because the training course to specifically to

262
00:43:04.610 --> 00:43:08.970
Sean Mouton:  an introduction for business

263
00:43:11.710 --> 00:43:35.059
Helen Garneau:  yeah, no, that would be that would be counter kinda productive to our effort, so yeah, we'll, we'll definitely, i'll, I'll reach out or Alex, if you talk to Stephen if you want to invite him to our next next month's meeting, and we can walk through the training and certain materials that would be, I think, a good idea.

264
00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:39.179
Helen Garneau: and it might also be

265
00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:51.109
Helen Garneau: oh, sorry, and it might also be helpful to bring, you know Sam in as well, and you know, with the 2 working group chairs and us. you know, really get into the nitty gritty. So if we draft, you know, take take

266
00:43:51.670 --> 00:44:09.110
Helen Garneau: the information that we have draft a new Wiki page, and then kind of wireframe out what the web, what the Hyper Ledger Foundation website Page would contain. and then present it to the working group, and then we could fine tune it with the working group chairs on our next call. I think that would be a good kind of

267
00:44:09.140 --> 00:44:10.220
Helen Garneau: next steps.

268
00:44:17.450 --> 00:44:19.080
Helen Garneau: So I'll put that under

269
00:44:19.230 --> 00:44:21.240
Helen Garneau: future topics.

270
00:44:22.100 --> 00:44:42.960
Helen Garneau: Oh, yeah, we did want to talk, and that was one of the questions we had had is about competitors like what? What? I maybe somebody on the call could answer the question, Shawn, or Tim or Robert. But who? What are the other competitors to Aries if someone's looking at building decentralized identity, what else are they looking at?

271
00:44:43.160 --> 00:44:47.740
Tim Bloomfield: That is your dominance, competitor? I I look at Iso. Mdl.

272
00:44:47.820 --> 00:44:56.670
Tim Bloomfield: yeah, problem is that that all the same things? But let's just say I. So I'd be an open Id for Vc. Is where a lot of people are going.

273
00:44:57.080 --> 00:45:19.810
Tim Bloomfield: now. They did the different things, and eventually I so generic standards. the id standards are coming out. Those are your primary competitors. I mean, open idea for Vc can actually work with in area. So it gets complicated. And it's been diagrams and then diagrams and stuff. But I would definitely say, the I saw stuff. especially government, which is very, very focused on Mdl, right now.

274
00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:21.160
Helen Garneau: Okay.

275
00:45:22.280 --> 00:45:24.529
Helen Garneau: is there a way to

276
00:45:24.780 --> 00:45:35.200
Helen Garneau: make it clear that open Id can work with Aries? Is there some some miscommunication or misunderstanding about any of those kind of competitors when it

277
00:45:35.710 --> 00:45:51.690
Tim Bloomfield: in that ven diagram. I I it's not that it. Yeah, I don't know this. Some of those have to sort of put it on chime in. So there's definitely pieces of areas that are are overlapping with open that even Vc issue. It's right. That's exactly what an issue is. And and and and and presenting proof

278
00:45:51.820 --> 00:46:01.079
Tim Bloomfield: both of those things are overlapping. But then you can, you know, a non-credit could be presented by a open id, you can see, be issued by it anyway, or a proof can be presented. So

279
00:46:01.110 --> 00:46:10.650
Tim Bloomfield: it it yeah, it's really hard to nail it down. I mean, there's there's there's a bit of a I don't know it better way of saying that an event diagram. But i'm not sure how you can clarify that

280
00:46:10.760 --> 00:46:15.130
Tim Bloomfield:  yeah, sorry, I have to think about it.

281
00:46:15.340 --> 00:46:36.380
Helen Garneau: No, I appreciate that. Yeah. I mean with the I think it'd come up Alex and I were, just, you know, thinking about what other mess? yeah. Messages out there. messages are out there from other organizations, other private entities, other open source entities, other standards, bodies, etc. And so yeah, that's, I think a great, a great place to start.

282
00:46:37.090 --> 00:47:02.310
Helen Garneau: yeah. As Alex mentioned, we're working on some sort of, you know. Did come language as well and open Id, for Vc. Is coming up there as well. And so it sounds like, there, there's yeah, an opportunity to clarify, to sort of clarify and and less muddy the waters. That would be a good place to do it. Actually, I think that's the best place to do it, because there's no reason why I did come and open the Vc. Cannot, cannot.

283
00:47:02.310 --> 00:47:10.039
Tim Bloomfield: we'll be side by side, but that's where there is some misunderstanding. You will think that you, you know, if you' that, you can't be using Gycom. Well, you you certainly could.

284
00:47:10.240 --> 00:47:14.440
Tim Bloomfield: It's just and so yeah, that that makes a lot of sense to me.

285
00:47:22.600 --> 00:47:23.640
Helen Garneau: Okay.

286
00:47:25.060 --> 00:47:45.190
Helen Garneau:  adding some notes into the page. another item that we had on our agenda was use cases, specifically going through the repos of and describing each

287
00:47:45.640 --> 00:47:46.980
Helen Garneau: a little more

288
00:47:48.850 --> 00:48:17.560
Helen Garneau: familiar, a little more palatable for somebody who doesn't know what a non-creds or doesn't know what Jason out, like all the all the different repos that are in Ares. How can we present those that you know, these ones kind of go together? And this is what they do. If you're looking to do this, you you want to look at these ones. If you, if you're looking to do this other thing, you want to look at these ones. So I think that was another question for Steven and Sam and and anybody on this call could you know, help help with, that is

289
00:48:17.560 --> 00:48:19.699
Helen Garneau: What different

290
00:48:19.710 --> 00:48:29.810
Helen Garneau: parts of Aries are most compatible with one another, and why would someone want to use one and not the other? And in making their their decisions on where to build.

291
00:48:31.160 --> 00:48:40.140
Tim Bloomfield: One thing you might want to look at there is. It's starting to come up. seeing it in over while the foundation others is the concept of profiles.

292
00:48:40.670 --> 00:48:48.129
Tim Bloomfield: really precise. It's it's not quite what you're asking, because, you know, you may have

293
00:48:48.260 --> 00:48:55.250
Tim Bloomfield: from peaked, you know they they I mean, once you've more use mobile ones more use for desktop. But really they actually allow the same functionality. But

294
00:48:55.450 --> 00:49:02.100
Tim Bloomfield: it does. I think profiles are an area where you could. You works in a list for this this credential scheme.

295
00:49:02.170 --> 00:49:13.589
Tim Bloomfield: this issue. It's this presentation to get our presentation for protocol, whatever it may be, very precisely listed so. But there's not many profiles right now.

296
00:49:13.820 --> 00:49:23.740
Tim Bloomfield: and that would at least help identify the and I, anyway, Overall Foundation is also working and trying to get profiles together. It's a swift try and identify those kinds of patterns.

297
00:49:23.770 --> 00:49:26.839
Helen Garneau: I don't know if it's going to be done with Aries to try it.

298
00:49:26.940 --> 00:49:28.809
Tim Bloomfield: Link them together. I'm not sure.

299
00:49:29.690 --> 00:49:41.779
Helen Garneau: Yeah, absolutely. I mean that the getting started is always. I mean, it is always a a a factor that comes up with Aries even not I mean, last week this week. I think I don't. I can't remember my weeks now.

300
00:49:41.780 --> 00:50:01.779
Helen Garneau: In the discord channel. There was somebody saying, I tried this, and I didn't know, and I don't know where to start. I tried to follow the guide on this that I found on the wet, like no one can. It's very. There's a high barrier of entry for using and understanding areas. And all of this work that we're doing is trying to lower that area of entry and get more people using it. More people understanding it, more people.

301
00:50:01.780 --> 00:50:07.350
Helen Garneau: a roadmap on where they want to go, based on what their use cases in their head that they've identified that

302
00:50:07.480 --> 00:50:16.439
Helen Garneau: decentralized identity, verifiable credentials. Whatever is, is would benefit them. So the more we can lower that barrier. I think that's that's the goal here.

303
00:50:16.840 --> 00:50:28.879
Tim Bloomfield: and that's where I mean the open Id for BC. Is so, being so successful. People think they know it because they already know all I, DC and all, even though it's I just protocol. But they understand it intuitively. It's very simple.

304
00:50:29.050 --> 00:50:41.000
Tim Bloomfield: It doesn't do as much, you know. You pick your poison. But yeah, that that's exactly where that that protocols standard, which is still, you know, has been finalized. So so you know, it's already EU's standard issuance.

305
00:50:41.040 --> 00:50:46.669
Tim Bloomfield: and that was done because of people could just understand it. And so, yeah, that's pretty important.

306
00:50:48.010 --> 00:50:49.210
Helen Garneau: Yeah, that's great.

307
00:50:49.270 --> 00:50:58.050
Helen Garneau:  yeah, I think there, there is some there was talk about open Id and Aries having some sort of

308
00:50:58.970 --> 00:51:20.720
Tim Bloomfield: agreement or co- collaboration in something or other. I'm not quite sure where what had come up. What was that? That was the wall, that open wallet which is different. Oh, sorry. Sorry. I'm mistaking my opens. Yeah, which is also very open for BC centric right now. But we'll also support, you know, which should also support down here is to come

309
00:51:20.740 --> 00:51:23.820
Tim Bloomfield: either the Swiss army knife. But yeah. yeah.

310
00:51:24.060 --> 00:51:28.970
Sean Mouton: So so open wallet is more related to.

311
00:51:29.540 --> 00:51:35.430
Sean Mouton: Let's call it authentication protocol when you log on to, and

312
00:51:35.690 --> 00:51:43.480
Sean Mouton: we we are. And that's where you can use in open wallet

313
00:51:43.630 --> 00:51:51.700
Sean Mouton: credentials, people, credentials that are issued. But, for example, open wallet wouldn't use

314
00:51:52.180 --> 00:51:54.669
Sean Mouton: proof of employment.

315
00:51:55.240 --> 00:52:00.830
Sean Mouton: It has the value in its current.

316
00:52:01.260 --> 00:52:12.069
Sean Mouton: Let's call it deployment, because using your proof of employment to log on is, you know, you draw the What is your identity to log on?

317
00:52:12.320 --> 00:52:19.419
Sean Mouton: Are we talking about the same? All the foundation hasn't. Is not that precisely prescribed?

318
00:52:19.780 --> 00:52:31.549
Tim Bloomfield: I don't talk about open Id here. I'm talking about open Id for Vc. Which does cover the same territories. This is different from O, I, DC, and that's you know, we're getting it to, probably, which is about authentication. But open Id for Vc.

319
00:52:31.660 --> 00:52:37.379
Sean Mouton: it's okay. Okay. I I'm I'm I'll open Id. They.

320
00:52:37.490 --> 00:52:43.390
Sean Mouton: But if you set up an Id for Vc, that's something different. It's not

321
00:52:43.620 --> 00:52:46.170
Sean Mouton: Alex. All who's starting, Helen.

322
00:52:46.820 --> 00:52:55.569
Tim Bloomfield: Yeah. The great confusion with the open Id, the number 4. And then Vc, and thanks for catching that

323
00:52:55.830 --> 00:53:01.979
Helen Garneau: apologies I put, yeah, I put in other places. Not I wasn't being prescriptive on it. But yeah, open id for Vc.

324
00:53:04.200 --> 00:53:12.740
Helen Garneau:  okay. Well, I mean, in the last few minutes here, I think we had a great this, I think this has been a great discussion on

325
00:53:13.950 --> 00:53:32.980
Helen Garneau: what more I think we were. We don't want to throw the baby out with the bath water, but we, you know, there is a lot that we could keep from Aries, I think, from the current areas, description and and messaging. But I think it's putting it in the right places for the right audiences. So we'll we will definitely be moving some things around, adding, like another higher level,

326
00:53:33.220 --> 00:54:04.219
Helen Garneau:  kind of description at the at this onset. but definitely want to get in into these nuances. So it it answers people. It's almost like a FAQ, not that we put an FAQ. But, like you know it, it's one of these common, the the misconceptions misunderstandings of technology. again, high high barriers of entry, people not understanding where to go and what to do, that we're trying to eliminate so that I think might be in the next iteration or next

327
00:54:04.270 --> 00:54:12.890
Helen Garneau: series of, you know, work steps for us moving forward. Once we kind of get the first first elements implemented.

328
00:54:13.090 --> 00:54:28.329
Helen Garneau: So what we're gonna do, I don't think there's other business. But I just took this template from someone else. So we're gonna do. We're going to invite Steven and Sam to the next call to talk about the training, the the training and certification.

329
00:54:28.650 --> 00:54:32.230
Helen Garneau: we're going to review

330
00:54:32.480 --> 00:54:53.800
Helen Garneau: and have them review kind of the new pages. that we will be drafted between now and then. for them to look at. And why, hopefully, a wire get a wireframe put together to at least give the Hyper Ledger foundation, so that when they implement their new website they can quickly kind of update them. The the language there. yeah. And in the meantime just focus on

331
00:54:54.250 --> 00:54:56.229
Helen Garneau: Oh, sorry for the action items.

332
00:54:57.650 --> 00:55:03.630
Helen Garneau: We're gonna just focus on updating the the wiki for now. and go from there.

333
00:55:04.930 --> 00:55:09.700
Helen Garneau: Yeah, very helpful feedback. Thank you.

334
00:55:11.620 --> 00:55:19.999
Helen Garneau:  cool. Is there any other kind of last minute? Call outs, comments. Anything that anybody wants to share.

335
00:55:28.820 --> 00:55:29.730
Alex Metcalf: Hmm!

336
00:55:30.900 --> 00:55:37.839
Alex Metcalf: I gave like no point one. Nathan's there.

337
00:55:38.000 --> 00:56:04.880
Helen Garneau: but yeah, so yeah, feel free to reach out. Feel free to, you know. Add notes, or or what have you on this page? Happy to keep the conversation going on discord.

338
00:56:04.880 --> 00:56:11.660
Alex Metcalf: This is not a point in time. This is the first that many a hey increments. You may get it all right first time, but we can keep improving it.

339
00:56:11.920 --> 00:56:24.870
Alex Metcalf: I think if we think of it that way, it's it's a lot more freedom, because everything's been, I think, a big step forward where we are right now in terms of what we're trying to show of all the great ones have in the areas last year. So let's let's do that to keep it going, and all the feedback as well.

340
00:56:26.650 --> 00:56:34.890
