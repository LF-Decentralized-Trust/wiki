09:40:12	 From Lance Byrd : Summary
The action-menu protocol allows one Agent to present a set of heirarchical menus and actions to another user-facing Agent in a human friendly way. The protocol allows limited service discovery as well as simple data entry. While less flexible than HTML forms or a chat bot, it should be relatively easy to implement and provides a user interface which can be adapted for various platforms, including mobile agents.
