13:06:06	 From  Horacio Nunez   to   Sam Curren (TelegramSam)(Direct Message) : Apologies for the short minute sign up!
13:36:24	 From  Kim Ebert : Are we concerned about embedded HTML in SVG compromising credentials?

14:12:33	 From  Chetan Vashistth : These interaction documents/ governance workflows are supposed to be updated time to time.So, would it immediately break all the apps working on previous version or should it support backward compatibility?
14:15:06	 From  Nathan George : Courtesy/manners can still count as governance
14:18:15	 From  Nathan George : We do ourselves a terrible disservice if we delude our users into thinking that someone who declares rules is bound to follow those rules.   Caveat emptor
14:19:20	 From  Chetan Vashistth : Understood.So, some interaction document can be strict and some can be optional as per the use case.
14:19:20	 From  Nathan George : If we cannot technically limit the interaction to the declaration then we may have over specified the declaration
14:21:42	 From  Chetan Vashistth : Thanks Nathan.
