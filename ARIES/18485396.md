      - Differs from Indy Wallet architecture by separating out auth and access control. Intention is to ensure a smooth transition from Indy.
      - Ability to export keys under certain conditions (metadata is set upon key creation)
    - Mike and Cam's aries-core-rs → aries-mayaguez

  - Release [0.4.5](https://aries-cloud-agent-python.readthedocs.io/en/0.4.5/) is on PyPi.
  - Revocation support has merged into master and is likely to included in the next release. Some smoothing of the edges happening.
    
    - Note: uses anoncreds 1.0 (hence, tails files) and so will be constrained in use cases to those with small numbers of credentials (e.g. ~25k per RevReg.
- Aries-Framework-Go (Troy) #aries-go
  
  - Enable common JavaScript API for both WASM and REST controller APIs.
  - Verifiable Credential controller APIs (validation and storage).
