## RFC Progress

## Other Business

- Proposals for an Aries SDK
  
  - Key questions:
    
    - Should there be an Aries SDK, used by most language frameworks?
    - Should it be in Rust?
    - What parts of Indy should we take?
    - How should it change over time?
  - Discussion summary:
    
    - A Rust C-callable API is very useful for functions that are common across the various Agents.
    - A ledger resolver API below the C-callable API is really useful, but higher level functions for writing schema defs and cred defs should be implemented on top of those primitives by the language libraries
      
      - Need to recruit a second ledger implementation besides Indy to ensure that the resolver API is sufficiently generic.

      - Should payments belong in Aries (libnullpay?)
    - [https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1sUffkRPlufingeeRjjBniVt9Ek3CNih9lUqym8mUl4M/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1sUffkRPlufingeeRjjBniVt9Ek3CNih9lUqym8mUl4M/edit?usp=sharing) Aries Architecture
    - [https://hackmd.io/\_BhJewTlSUqMGNDc4SvgNw?edit](https://hackmd.io/_BhJewTlSUqMGNDc4SvgNw?edit) developing ideas around APIs

## Future Topics

- Library threading models and synchronicity
  
  - Resolver and wallet might have different needs than other API functions.
- Payments in Aries
- wallet query language
