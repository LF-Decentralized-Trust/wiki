  - Adding a tag to indicate the DID in the wallet to use for invites.
- Upgrading Wallet Types

  - Two tickets that describe this.
    
    - Supporting both wallet types simultaneously – askar and askar-anoncreds
    - Upgrade process for single- and multi-tenant controllers.
    - Have to consider this on all upgrades to multi-tenant – where there are breaking changes.
- Release 1.0
- AnonCreds – how to add a new AnonCreds supporting DID Method/ledger.
  
  - Wallet create – has hard coded list of DID types vs. pluggable.

## Upcoming Meeting Topics:

## Future Topics

- Sonar Cloud - is this actually working? Add issue to take a look – perhaps Wade or Jason Syrotuck.
- OpenAPI - Indicio is doing post processing on the OpenAPI file, because what is in the repo is not especially useful.
  
  - too many values being marked as optional – especially on receipt of results from the Admin API.
  - multiple use of the schema – technically they are optional in other places, but not in the OpenAPI
  - Response schemas aren't enforced allowing for returned values to differ
- Code coverage reports on ACA-Py
