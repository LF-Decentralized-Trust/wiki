# Hyperledger Aries : Aries Bifold User Group

Created by Sam Curren, last modified by Jason Leach on Jan 08, 2024

A user group to promote the Aries Bifold Mobile App community, centered around continuous growth and improvement of code.

This page will add new information as it becomes available.

### Meetings

The Aries Bifold User Group meetings are held every second Tuesday at 8AM Pacific. SeeÂ [Meeting Details](Aries-Bifold-User-Group-Meetings_18490725.html) for information on how to join.

### Community

Engaging with the Bifold community is easy via Hyperledger's Discord. Here's how:

1\. Visit [https://discord.com/invite/hyperledger](https://discord.com/invite/hyperledger)  
2\. Accept the invite!  
3\. Start exploring channels!

Our main conversation hub is \`#bifold\`, dedicated to Bifold Wallet discussions. Since Bifold relies heavily on Aries Framework Javascript (AFJ), you may also find \`#aries-javascript\` useful for in-depth technical discussions. Come join us!
