## Agenda

- Record the meeting

## Meeting Notes

- Issue Credential protocol update
  
  - It seems we need to add at least some dummy revocation registry because it's not possible to put empty \`revRegId\` into issuerCreateCredential method. Then just the prover side would be missing.
- Proof Presentation will start next week
  
  - There is an introductory video about the framework which could be helpful  [https://us02web.zoom.us/rec/share/\_O5QDK6t-zhIeYmUt0P2ZfB5War4eaa8hnQbrPoFyUkeftTVW-BuANsdYcyfoopy](https://us02web.zoom.us/rec/share/_O5QDK6t-zhIeYmUt0P2ZfB5War4eaa8hnQbrPoFyUkeftTVW-BuANsdYcyfoopy) (Password: 1l=r5I1!)
