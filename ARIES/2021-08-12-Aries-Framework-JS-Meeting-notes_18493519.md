## Meeting Notes

## Future topics

- React Native testing
- Support for Deno
  
  - Although it's not our focus right now, it should be possible in the long term.
  - First, we need to analyze if the following dependencies will work in Deno or what we need to do to make it work:
    
    - indy-sdk
    - native dependencies (file system, transport protocols like HTTP or WebSockets, ...)
    - other dependencies in package.json
- Monorepo dependencies
  
  - TypeScript types
