    - Indy wallet crate might move to start another aries-kms implementation → aries-kms-vostok

      - Proof in DIDComm
      - Mapping (Alex)
      - Cred Def (Alex)
      - Presentation Def (Ken and Brent)

      <!--THE END-->
    - - Update existing HIPEs/RFCs (Alex)
      - HIPEs/RFCs for new objects:
    - Indy Node implementation (95% done) (Alex)
    - Indy-vdr (Andrew N)
    - - Prerequisite: CI / CD for indy-vdr, and integration into Indy SDK
    - aries-credx (Andrew N and Echo)
    - - create\_w3c\_cred
      - sign\_w3c\_cred
      - verify\_w3c\_cred
      - create\_presentation
  - Milestones
    
    1. Issue a credential
    2. Verify using a presentation definition with ZKP signature
  - Aries-Framework-Go already supports W3C VC's: JSON-LD and JWTs
  - Avoid the term "Rich Schema" in artifacts and code.
- Merge indy-credx with aries-credx?
  
  - [https://github.com/sovrin-foundation/aries-credx-framework-rs](https://github.com/sovrin-foundation/aries-credx-framework-rs)
    
    - Generic APIs that are pluggable
    - Test vectors for interop
      
      - W3C test suite doesn't have encodings / mappings in the data model
      - But should test against the W3C test suite for the shape of the data model
      - aries-framework-go W3C test suite CI: [https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-go/actions?query=workflow%3Atest-suite](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-go/actions?query=workflow%3Atest-suite)
  - [https://github.com/andrewwhitehead/indy-credx](https://github.com/andrewwhitehead/indy-credx)
    
    - Anoncreds 1.0 won't have the W3C credential container
- Indy VDR is moved to Hyperledger
  
  - [https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-vdr](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-vdr)
- CI / CD Aries shared libraries
  
  - Prefer GitHub Actions.
    
    - Use GitHub Actions Runner for iOS and Android hosted by the Sovrin Foundation.
    - Can easily migrate to Azure Pipelines or Circle CI if needed.
  - Aries-Framework-Go is using both GitHub Actions and (to a limited extent) Azure Pipelines
    
    - Azure Pipelines supported deployments that GitHub Actions didn't (likely does now)
    - Azure Pipelines worked better for heavy tests:  more computationally intensive and parallel
  - We plan to reduce the number of architectures. Won't support old devices.
- When building Aries Util (pack / unpack) will migrate from LibSodium to Ursa key exchange?
  
  - Probably, but need additional testing.
- BC.gov is using Pyo3 as well as FFI in shared libraries
  
  - Python extension written in Rust that wraps crate directly. Improves performance and security. Allows multiple threads.
  - Take a different approach for FII? Raw pointers or buffer paradigm instead of serialized strings
  - [https://github.com/andrewwhitehead/indy-credx/blob/master/wrappers/python/src/buffer.rs](https://github.com/andrewwhitehead/indy-credx/blob/master/wrappers/python/src/buffer.rs)
