# Hyperledger Aries : 2019-09-11-A Aries Working Group Call (US morning)

Created by Richard Esplin, last modified on Sep 11, 2019

## Summary:

- The right place to create an Anoncreds library: shared libraries export C-callable API, but the language doesn't matter (C, Rust, Go)
- Aries-Framework-Go has a Verifiable Credential package that could be made available to other frameworks
- Building a generic DIDDoc parser
- Aries-Wallet is probably the right shared library to build first

## Note: This call is Recorded. Recordings posted at the bottom of the page.

## Date

11 Sep 2019 (7AM Los Angeles, 10AM New York, 3PM London, 17H Moscow)

## RFC Progress

## Other Business

- Aries shared libraries export their API as C-callable, but the implementation language doesn't matter: C, Rust, Go
- DIDDoc parser in Rust:
  
  - [https://crates.io/crates/did\_doc](https://crates.io/crates/did_doc)
  - [https://github.com/dhuseby/did](https://github.com/dhuseby/did)
- What is the next step we can take:
  
  - Richard's proposal for order of work
    
    - Move Indy-SDK into Aries-Core (October release)
    - Split out wallet into Aries-Wallet (November release)
    - Define the resolver interface (November effort)
    - Split out resolver into Indy-Resolver (December release)
  - Questions
    
    - Iterative approach: do something that we can improve on.
      
      - Start with the needs of the agents (Aries-Cloud-Agent) and build the Aries core architecture from that.
    - Maintain Indy-SDK alongside Aries-Core / Aries-Wallet / Aries-Resolver?
    - Who will be the maintainers of the new libraries? Do we want cross-organization PR reviews?
    - Best way to maintain history, and  make the reorg transparent
      
      - History continues public in Indy-SDK, so might be better to start clean in Aries
      - concerns with old DCO process: can use Mike Lodder's approach he used for moving indy-crypto to ursa
    - What to do with the Indy CLI?
    - CI / CD in Jenkins or GitLab?
  - Daniel's proposal for order of work
    
    - Split out Indy wallet into Aries-Wallet
    - Define the resolver interface and create the resolver libraries (indy and peer)
      
      - The peer DID resolver isn't dependent on other libraries [https://github.com/dhh1128/pypeerdid](https://github.com/dhh1128/pypeerdid)
    - Wait on Aries-Core
- Architecture of Aries core library
  
  - What is our fastest path to a library that framework implementors could consider using?
  - Daniel's analysis of Aries API Surfaces [https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ODtHCeB6x7yVGfhyJHFUKn0f070sqZXhff1C8M7jfTY/edit?ts=5d658905#slide=id.p](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ODtHCeB6x7yVGfhyJHFUKn0f070sqZXhff1C8M7jfTY/edit?ts=5d658905#slide=id.p)
