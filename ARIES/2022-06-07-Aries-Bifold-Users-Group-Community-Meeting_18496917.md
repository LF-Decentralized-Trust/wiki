## Deployments and Work Updates

## Agenda

1\. PIN Screen;  
2\. Update on INDY SDK for macOS / iOS;  
3\. Review PRs and Issues;  
4\. Review New Documentation;  
5\. Publish Reference Wallet to iTunes and Google Play  
6\. Apple's Wallet News (WWDC2022)  
7\. Update AFJ to latest version.  
8\. Slow first credential issue.

- BCGov team (Clecio) almost has Indy SDK working fo iOS. This means we'll be able to run Bifold in simulators. He's currently just looking to beta test it and find a way to publish it. Working with repo owners on this. Maybe two weeks out; #2 above.
- BCGov team (Akiff) is working on updating Bifold to the latest and greatest (0.2.0) beta. As he uncovers any show stopper issues he's getting them fixed. When we have feature parity with the current release we'll merge; #1 above.
- Apple WWDC2022 [introduces some privacy preserving features](https://youtu.be/q5D55G7Ejs8?t=1291) for their wallet and passkey. See more here; #6 above.
- We could address the slow load time noticed on first credential with machine readable governance. This would allow us to pre-fetch any important information so its ready before the user needs it; #8 above.
- IDLab from Quebec will help publish a base Bifold reference wallet to iTunes and Google Play. IDLabs is a nonprofit organization in Canada helping to advance digital IDs in Canada; #5 above.
- We'll close Dependabot PRs once we update Bifold in the near future. Will update AFJ, RN, and other packages. We will schedule some time in a UG meeting to close open PRs that are stale. We'll also do our best to clean up some that appear to be stale independently. #3, #4, above.
- Indecio (Ryan) will close his QR code PR and re-issue it with some work done to make it easier to turn on/off features;
