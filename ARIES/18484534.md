## Agenda

- Issue Game: Can we close this? (15 min -) -  issues (as time permits): [290](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/issues/290), [77](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/issues/77), [225](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/issues/225), [122](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/issues/122)
  
  - Decisions 122 closed, 290 BCGov will pursue, 77 and 225
- Should the ~service decorator be part of AIP 1.0.0? [PR link](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/pull/350). [Richard Esplin](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/712020:8b35bfaa-715c-4137-8dbd-c4fdab87b671?ref=confluence)
  
  - Evernym reviewed the RFC and discussed the ACApy implementation. Our concerns are resolved.
    
    - New ACApy test showing how a return response endpoint would be routed through two or more mediators.
- Proposal for adding [RFC 348](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/features/0348-transition-msg-type-to-https) to AIP 1.0
  
  - Advantages:
    
    - Would start a transition period to the new approach.
    - Reduces pressure on the next version of Aries Interop Profile
  - Concerns:
    
    - Doesn't seem to fit the scope of AIP 1.0 (define credential exchange in practice today)
    - What does it mean to require support of a transitional feature from a compliance perspective?
- Connection Blues - Continued - [Sam Curren](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/557058:1ed5fd92-7e42-4cab-87b1-688e48bc02c2?ref=confluence)/ [Stephen Curran](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/557058:d676f135-ecd6-465b-b7eb-f87976bf4569?ref=confluence)
  
  - Using DIDs to use existing invitation
    
    - When an invitation starts from a Public DID, this should be retained by the agent.
    - Future invitation Public DIDs can be looked up to see if an existing relationship exists.
    - New DID Exchange Message from invitee saying "I'm going to use this existing connection, but exercise a new invitation"
  - Connect→Then Invitations
    
    - How to best compose messages?
    - Nicely accommodate connectionless messages.
    - The Then is more semantically important than the Connection
  - Safe URL redirectors
    
    - What to avoid
    - Is there a way to do this safely?
    - Can we do this with DIDComm? (An Expand Message Protocol?)
    - Attachment? (Can fetch from place x), with integrity check and possibly decryption key
- ACApy/Credential F2 Registry HighVolume Performance Testing - [Stephen Curran](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/557058:d676f135-ecd6-465b-b7eb-f87976bf4569?ref=confluence)
