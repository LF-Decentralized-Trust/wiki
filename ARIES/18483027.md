## Other Business

- Payments in Aries
  
  - Currently have the payment decorator defines how to request payment and prove that payment happened (same information as the W3C Web Payments standard).
    
    - Protocol gap in actually making the payment. Should be pluggable (application agnostic).
  - Payments are defined as part of credential issuance and presentation
  - Top level concept like KMS?
- Using hardware enclaves (Mike L.)
  
  - Agent KMS Considerations: [![](plugins/servlet/confluence/placeholder/unknown-macro)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10AXC6tRe_aqPPySeV4QzJbrteiTn5vxP9TVNSCJX2wA/edit)
  - Steve M. has played a lot with the Apple enclave and can help.
  - Tension between security of a hardware enclave, and the portability promises of SSI.
    
    - Assumption is that any key put into an enclave cannot come out.
  - Ursa will provide an interface for interacting with an enclave (abstract the complexity).
    
    - Needs flexibility: mobile enclave, enterprise HSM
