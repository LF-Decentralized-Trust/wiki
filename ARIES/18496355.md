- Items Affecting Interop Results
  
  - \`auto-&lt;options&gt;\` turned on in acapy-backchannel causes some tests to fail. Most interop tests expect agent has no auto options on.
    
    - Conversation: [https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-agent-test-harness/pull/448](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-agent-test-harness/pull/448)
    - Resulting Issue: [https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-agent-test-harness/issues/456](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-agent-test-harness/issues/456)
    - Need an approach to turn on auto options in the test harness at the scenario level. 
      
      - Approaches Proposed
        
        - Set another test execution in the workflow with an agent config file.
        - A new run set altogether with also uses an agent config file.
        - Utilize the /agent/command/agent/start endpoint and do it dynamically during runtime. Uses \`@UsesCustomParameters\` to trigger.
        - Start a new agent (auto\_acme for example) in the set of agents started, this one has an agent config file that can be used.
        - Others?

## Next Meeting

- June 9th same time

## Future Topics

- Running and tracking Mobile test results with AATH.

## Action items

- Fix the Meeting Zoom link
- For the auto-option issue/solution, we will be going with the agent start/stop endpoint done dynamically for the scenario needing it.
- Invite participants to the ZenHub Board.
