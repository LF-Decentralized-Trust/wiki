The purpose of this Hackathon is to bridge the gap between technology and innovation by maximizing social impact. The problem statement is purposefully broad to spur innovation and to serve as a guide on ways to address social needs. Let's collaborate to ideate, prototype, and launch blockchain for social impact solutions.

# Social Impact Problem Statement:

Distributed ledger technologies (DLT) offers significant potential to deliver benefits for humanitarian aid, development, and civil society institutions in general. Let's hack to create solutions which could help various actors move more quickly on use cases with high potential to positively impact social good. 

- **Philanthropy and Remittance** (donation traceability, aid transparency, digital currencies in aid and development, governance and accountability)
- **Financial Empowerment** (financial inclusion, microfinance, microinsurance)
- **Identity and Land Rights** (refugee assistance, land ownership documentation)
- **Governance and Democracy** (fighting censorship and fake news, voting rights and protections, election integrity)
- **Supply Chain and Environmental Protections** (sustainable supply chain, fair trade, ethical sourcing, fair labor practices, pharmaceutical - COVID-19 impacts, transportation, or other)

### Guidelines:

- Team are encouraged to build a working proof-of-concept on an open source blockchain platform (preferably Hyperledger Technologies) with applicable user interface to describe the user story
- Teams are required to complete a Business Model Canvas (1-page high level description of their proposed solution). For more information on [Business Model Canvas](https://medium.com/seed-digital/how-to-business-model-canvas-explained-ad3676b6fe4a)

### Winning Teams:

- Mentorship from Hyperledger Social Impact SIG and Hyperledger India Chapter community to further your concept
- Opportunity to apply to the Government Blockchain Association GBA Annual Achievement Award 2021 for Social Impact. For more information: [https://www.gbaglobal.org/gba-annual-achievement-awards-2021](https://www.gbaglobal.org/gba-annual-achievement-awards-2021/)
