**JURY RESPONSIBILITIES**

Each submission is to be evaluated individually. Use a point scale of 10 for the scores. With 10 being the highest and 0 being the least. Scores can have decimal points.

Only 2 digits are considered in the aggregated score. The decimal point is rounded off to the nearest number to arrive at the final score upon aggregation.

There is no mandate on scoring a submission. However, average score from the other jury is given to that particular submission. This is to keep the healthy competitive environment and give benefit of doubt to the submission.

Jury scores are not shared with each others.

Jury gets 2 days after the event to finalize their scores.

Jury is free to ask additional questions to the team.

Jury is free to choose the evaluation criteria. We decided this because there are personal preferences where one could be good in evaluating presentation, one on innovation aspect, one on the tech stack used, one can infact choose all of these criteria for evaluation. Every jury will be individually evaluating the projects. It is advisable to fixup the criteria you as a jury want to evaluate a project. Here's a guidance format for reference [![](plugins/servlet/confluence/placeholder/unknown-macro)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FaM5m4SukQZi2u86LG2ImyyiOgjVmJnFgnXdOvrLxdA/edit#gid=1487568147)
