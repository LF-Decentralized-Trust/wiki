How do you foresee startups benefiting from and contributing to interoperable ecosystems that span various blockchains and technologies?    GigoTokenomics play a central role in many Web3 projects. What considerations should startups keep in mind when designing tokenomics for their platforms?    Vikram

The open-source nature of Web3 encourages collaboration and community engagement. What strategies can startups use to effectively build and nurture communities around their projects?      
Could you share examples of successful projects or applications built on Web3 principles that have significantly disrupted traditional business models? (Any startup examples will be good to share here).      
What challenges and opportunities do startups face when implementing decentralized governance models, and how can they navigate these effectively?  
How have you seen traditional business models evolve as a result of Web3 adoption? What advice would you give to startups looking to pivot their models to incorporate decentralized principles?
