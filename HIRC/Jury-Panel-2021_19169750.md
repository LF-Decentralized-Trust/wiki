With around 25 years of experience in technology and real-estate, Darshana has broken quite a few stereotypes about women in male-dominated businesses.

She is also the Regional Chair for FIBREE (Foundation for International Blockchain and Real Estate Expertise) 

Her varied roles in strategy, engineering, business development, sales, marketing, and company leadership with Fortune 500 companies in the US and UK have given her a strong global edge. She puts this to good use to help start-ups she invests in to scale up, drive profitability and create sustainable business growth.

Darshana is currently the CEO  and partner in Snapper Future Tech. She firmly believes that enterprise blockchain is the future and can help solving real world problems in identity management, sustainable supply chain, e- governance and healthcare.
