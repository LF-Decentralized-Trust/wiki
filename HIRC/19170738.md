## **Background**

The Hyperledger India chapter is always appreciated by the Hyperledger staff.  We need collaborative efforts to build a stronger &amp; growing community in India.

Let's brainstorm and come up with workable strategy to build grow Hyperledger India community.

## **Goal:**

To grow and connect with 50000 active community members in India chapter.

## **Time limit:**

By **31 January 2024** (before Hyperledger Global forum 2023).

## **Events/Chapter Roadmap 2023:**

## **In what area:**

- Communication strategy.
- Networking Strategy.
- Prospective developer Strategy.
- Student Engagement Strategy.

Please add your thought process and Ideas to make this possible. I have added a few action items which we should consider.

## **Action items**

### **In what area**

### **Reasonable actions**

### **Why to be done**

### Risk if not done

**Action**Communication Strategy

- End of the presentation ( how to connect with community)
- Contents in the Hyperledger India youtube channel.
- Guideline for social media postings.

To engage the audience.

communication continuty will break and migrate to some other tools.

Networking Strategy

- Active participation in events &amp; promote Hyperledger India community
- Participation in Colleges and University Technical festival
- Different ways to interact with college and start with a introductory presentation about Hyperleger projects

To reach new members.we will miss the target by big margin.

Prospective Developer Strategy

- Code contributions workshops - Monthly
- Medium like post in hyperleger wiki post
- Know-how contents (from scratch to introduction of the tool and frameworks)
- what we are offering to student societies (see the page for [possible questions](Hyperledger-India---Study-Circle_19169952.html))

Hyperledger tools documentation is good for people who have experience on the tools.   
Student Engagement Strategy

- Activating study circles
- Student Newsletter (highlight the achievement)
- Create certificate of participation scheme

To make them feel valuable to community.

They will leave

Find Code contributors 

- Find the contributor from India in Hyperledger project code base

There are many developers who are not active in India chapter community
