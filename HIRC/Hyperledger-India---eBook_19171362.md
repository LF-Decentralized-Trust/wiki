The "West Bengal Blockchain Technology Promotion Guidelines, 2020" outlines a comprehensive plan to leverage blockchain for efficient service delivery, focusing on both government-to-citizen (G2C) and government-to-government (G2G) services. Key initiatives include the use of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) by the New Town Kolkata Development Authority to manage land ownership records, enhancing transparency and eliminating manual paperwork. Additionally, municipal corporations in Durgapur and Bankura districts have developed a blockchain-based platform for issuing legal documents like birth certificates, ensuring secure processing. In collaboration with Web3 startup Airchains, a blockchain-based system for recording and tracking land ownership and mutations in New Town Kolkata has been introduced, improving transparency, security, and efficiency in land management. The guidelines also propose establishing a hybrid blockchain platform hosted within the state's data center or relevant cloud services, providing robust infrastructure for future applications. These initiatives underscore West Bengal's commitment to harnessing blockchain technology for improved governance.

### AE.    Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman &amp; Diu

### AF    The Government of NCT of Delhi

The Delhi government has emerged as a frontrunner in leveraging blockchain technology for government processes in India. In a groundbreaking initiative, Delhi implemented blockchain in its Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) to ensure tamper-proof handling of evidence collected from crime scenes. This creates an immutable record of the evidence chain, enhancing transparency and reliability in the judicial system. Although broader implementations haven't been announced yet, this initial success paves the way for exploring blockchain's potential in other areas like land record management and citizen service delivery.

Additionally, the Software Technology Parks of India (STPI) has set up an incubation facility in the Delhi NCR region to foster 100 blockchain startups. The centre, equipped with 80 workstations, conference rooms, and an auditorium, aims to support startups and promote entrepreneurship in blockchain technology. The Centre of Excellence (CoE) will collaborate with ecosystem players to provide support in the form of dedicated blockchain platforms, mentorship, mentoring programs, VC funding, and more. This development comes at a time when both the government and private sector are increasingly using blockchain and working on new use cases for the technology, positioning Delhi as a leader in blockchain innovation and adoption.

### AG.   Jammu &amp; Kashmir

### AH.   Ladakh

### AI.    Lakshadweep

### AI.    Puducherry

Puducherry government is leading in the technology enhancements by providing the necessary support to its citizens and officials. It is one of the first union territories to get involved in the central government's blockchain projects. It has implemented the land registry using blockchain, certificate chain, and is working on the public distribution system using blockchain. Puducherry government is providing incentives to the logistics companies which adapt latest technologies inclusive of blockchain for real-time supply chain management. Logistics Centre of Excellence (LCoE) will provide the necessary training for incorporating the new technology in supply chain, which in turn provide Smart Enforcement by means of minimal inspection and stoppages of trucks on road.

### Central Government Applications:

The Center of Excellence in Blockchain Technology which was formed in 2020 under the Ministry of Electronics &amp; Information Technology in collaboration with the National Informatics Centre is running 5 blockchain products successfully as of June 2024. It has successfully involved 9 central organizations and states, onboarding 19 departments, and incorporating 8,08,39,919 documents. It also provides 6 verification services, and there are 5 projects in PoC stage.

The 5 live blockchain products are:

Certificate Chain is developed to overcome the drawbacks of paper-based certificates. In this system, the Certificate can be accessed online by any authorized person / institution and be assured that it is genuine and not tampered – all this without the need for an intermediary. This provides the necessary trust to the agencies which use these documents to ascertain the eligibility for providing benefit to the citizens. The academic documents of Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) is being stored in the Blockchain, which is a nationwide revolutionary application.

Document Chain is a single platform that provides the issuing authorities and consuming entities a standard procedure for storage and retrieval of any document issued by the government such as caste, income, ration card, driving license, birth &amp; death certificates etc.

The certificates / documents onboarded till now with state / department wise are given below:

Drug Logistics Chain provides traceability in the transactions (track &amp; trace) reducing the changes of entry of spurious drugs, enhances precision and brings transparency. Patient can check the details of the manufacturer, expiry details &amp; quality of the medicine before consumption. Efficient recall system can be implemented when the quality of the drug is found to be not-of-standard. The resulting integrated supply chain system brings in all stake holders to a common platform. This is successfully deployed by the Karnataka state government for the past few years.

Judiciary Chain democratize access to the justice system by reducing complexity related to availability of trusted, immutable, time-stamped data and documents.

Property Chain records the property transactions in the shared/distributed manner with all the participating stakeholders. The property transactions are recorded in the chain based on the consensus with the stakeholders. This eliminates the need for dependency on the third party or intermediary to approve the transactions. The property transactions are linked and stored with cryptographic security so that they are immutable and traceable. The linking of the blocks (group of transactions) in the Blockchain ensures that they cannot be tampered with. The property transactions are trustable as they can be verified across the participating stakeholders, resulting in a system that is secured, trusted, immutable, traceable, &amp; verifiable. 

Most of the Indian states are providing their support for these projects and effectively implementing them in the respective states.
