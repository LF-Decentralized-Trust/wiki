# Hyperledger India Regional Chapter : To do list: To start a HIC student society chapter

Created by Ravi singh, last modified by A Anasuya Threse Innocent on Mar 14, 2024

An Hyperledger India Chapter (HIC) student society chapter provides opportunities to meet and learn from the community as well as engagement with professionals working in open source in permissioned blockchain locally.

# **Step 1: Recruit ten student members and a faculty advisor**

- A minimum of ten students are needed to create a HIC student society chapter.
- Students must have an active status at your institute/university.
- A student society must have **two faculty advisors** (**Faculty Ambassador)** to serve as a liaison between Hyperledger India chapter and your institute/university, and **two students** (**Student Ambassador)** to carry out the organization of the student society chapter in your institute/university.

# **Step 2: Complete the student society application.**

Before you start this step, make sure you have:                    

- Secured the required **ten student memberships**.
- Determined **two faculty** advisor's role (**Faculty Ambassador)**.
- Determined **two student** roles (**Student Ambassador).**
- Established a name “HIC student society chapter  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_”.
- Created a chapter email for faculty advisors to receive messages in one location (any service provider will work).
- Obtained a letter from your institute/university that recognizes your HIC student society chapter as an official organization.
- The letter should have a reference number and point of contact name and contact information (faculty or administrator), not a student.
