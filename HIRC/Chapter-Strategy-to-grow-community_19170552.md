Networking Strategy

- Active participation in events &amp; promote Hyperledger India community
- Participation in Colleges and University Technical festival
- Different ways to interact with college and start with a introductory presentation about Hyperleger projects
- Monthly Linkedin live - Community updates  (suggested name in community call : ***Hyperledger India Monthly Hangout/Huddle***
- When new member attended the call, how to add them to the community page (themself using LFID)

To reach new members.we will miss the target by big margin.

[Ravi singh](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/6207b125f5d29a0068fd3a32?ref=confluence) A [new member welcome page](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/HIRC/A+Welcome+to+New+Hyperledger+India+Chapter+Members) page has been created with to do instructions 

[kamlesh nagware](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/557058:8e1fc425-f938-4b39-ad13-9cd8b0ddde52?ref=confluence) monthly LinkedIn live at 10 am first Saturday of  the month.

Prospective Developer Strategy

- Code contributions workshops - Monthly
- Medium like post in hyperleger wiki post
- Know-how contents (from scratch to introduction of the tool and frameworks)
- what we are offering to student societies (see the page for [possible questions](Hyperledger-India---Study-Circle_19169952.html))

In GUI ways, attension span is narrowed to less than 10 second, so we must ask questions **"How to make the content more engaging to students?"**

Hyperledger tools documentation is good for people who have experience on the tools.   
Student Engagement Strategy

- Activating study circles
- Student Newsletter (highlight the achievement)
- **Non-dev enganegemt:**
  
  - Campus Ambassador Program for undergraduate students - Aim: To drive traffic to our social media pages by spreading info on meetups, workshops, etc.
  - Live Projects for MBA students - 3 month program with weekly goals to increase engagement by numbers
- Create certificate of participation scheme
- Training certification by India chapter ([kartikey.dav100](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/5d5fd1d08de8420ca06d3048?ref=confluence) )
- To do list for new member
- Finalize the how to start student society at your institute/university[(link to page](19170661.html)).

To make them feel valuable to community.
