Blockchain Stories 2020 // Hyperledger India Chapter.

Hyperledger is an open source community focused on developing a suite of stable frameworks, tools and libraries for enterprise-grade blockchain deployments. Since it’s contrivance in December 2015 by the Linux Foundation, it has certainly come a long way and vividly progressed into the World of Enterprise Blockchain Solutions. To carry forward this revolutionary tech, many firms, industries, techies and social groups took the responsibility of marching forward with the Hyperledger Baton! One of them is *Hyperledger India Chapter*. The Hyperledger India Chapter is responsible for growing the Hyperledger community in India, promoting contributions to Hyperledger projects and providing a platform for collaboration, mentoring and support. The chapter aims to showcase the broad range of Hyperledger projects and initiatives to the Indian audience. In the last week of May and all throughput June, [Hyperledger India Chapter](https://www.linkedin.com/company/hyperledger-india-chapter/?viewAsMember=true) has carried out a series of interactive events called as, ***“Blockchain Stories 2020”***.

The event series was as follows:

1. [Blockchain Stories 2020 part 1.](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/CP/Blockchain+Stories+2020+Part+1)

The first two parts of these event series included topics like Trade Digitization with DLT, Trade Business Platform, Data Exchange Marketplace in Hyperledger Fabric, Blockchain Start-up Stories, Enterprise Grade Hyperledger Fabric Deployments, Modernizing Multinational Insurance etc. The topics included were highly interactive, the audience got to know about various use cases of Hyperledger Fabric on an Enterprise Level. Part 1 &amp; Part 2 mainly were focused about how Hyperledger Fabric Frameworks can be used and implemented on an enterprise level to inculcate Blockchain Technology into Application Development, Supply Chain Logistics, Healthcare &amp; Infrastructure etc. Even though Blockchain has a significant potential, it is not a one-off stop solution at the Enterprise Level. Naturally, every industry or enterprise has distinctive needs and certain type of varied requirements, that is why Blockchain needs to modify and adapt accordingly as per its requirements. Therefore, the industry felt a need for a customizable Blockchains with different features that would fit the need of the enterprises perfectly.  That is where Hyperledger Fabric and Frameworks come in and act as a Green-House for Developers, Users &amp; Vendors all from varied Industries. It also means that there is an ecosystem of these parties that co-exist and thrive off of each other, in a very helping and supporting manner of course. Hyperledger Fabric is a permissioned, general-purpose blockchain and is also one of the most stable blockchains for creating and developing enterprise solutions.  Fabric serves as an extensible blockchain framework for deploying enterprise-grade distributed applications. It supports various consensus mechanisms and customization to deliver upon different use cases and trust models.

**Blockchain Stories Part 3, 4 &amp; 5:**

The final  parts of Blockchain Stories 2020 were mainly focusing on topics like, Making Blockchain Education Compulsory in Colleges, Blockchain Adoption &amp; Role of automation, Trust Protocol for Certificates, Blockchain as a Service, Hyperledger Fabric Solution etc. These sessions focused more on how Blockchain as a technology is a pillar for all the other technologies and implementing them in the Industry.

With Global Leaders, Politicians &amp; Industrialists pondering upon the idea of mass implementation of Blockchain Technology, the question arises, “What are the barriers to adoption?” There are various aspects to adoption of Blockchain that may act as barriers which are both psychological as well as technological. The foremost dilemma in the adoption of Blockchain is its reputation. Blockchain still being heavily connected to the crypto world, it still makes it hard for some Industrialists that have been in the game for a long time now. For some it may be a psychological factor that acts as reluctance for adopting Blockchain Tech, for others the majority factor is technical as well as technological. Things like immaturity, interoperability, lack of proper infrastructure, and even yet, mainly, a sheer lack of Blockchain Talent.

Nevertheless, Blockchain Technology is inevitable and will be implemented on a drastically larger scale, sooner or later. Indian Blockchain Firms have definitely made an impact on Blockchain 4.0 in industry applications and solutions. This created a massive hype amongst the young, brilliant and blooming minds of the youth in India and Indian educational institutions have lived up to its expectations to say the least, by providing qualitative as well as quantitative knowledge, content, use cases, real life projects and assignments for students to work on and get a hands-on experience of working on a Blockchain Technology. Blockchain Tech has already made its way into many majority mainstream industries which were previously prone to a Single Point of Failure. Many industries like, Healthcare, Education, Supply-Chain Logistics &amp; Management, Production and Tracking of Delivery etc., have already started to implement Blockchain Tech either completely or partially.
