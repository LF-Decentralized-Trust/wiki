  - Current Status: [![](plugins/servlet/confluence/placeholder/unknown-macro)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1J-J9sUGCqZc5qf11tAUs6On1am-DhpPrpXIVUX5j7c8/edit#gid=0)
  - Narration video complete (Thanks Chris!)
  - Chinese/Japanese/Brazilian Portuguese/English (Thank you Joe!)
  - Next up: English Blog based on written responses.
    
    - *"Not all people have technical training, not all mastered the necessary technologies to collaborate with the development of fabric, however, the process of translation, by being simple, allows more people to feel comfortable collaborating, making their engagement simpler."*
    - *"The process of translating is also the process of learning. I know the basic principles and usage, so I passed the CHFA exam and got the certificate easily."*
    - *"The TWGC releases seasonal contribution lists, one of which is the translation contribution list consisting of translator's name and organization. That greatly motivates developers to contribute on behalf of their companies as many contributors are eager to show up as top 3 on the list."*
    - *" It is a big responsibility. However, receiving comments from people who have used the Portuguese translation, saying it was very useful to them, is priceless."*
- Documentation Meetup - follow-up
  
- Getting Started [https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/pull/1999](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/pull/1999)
  
- Conceptual and/or Operational content for Orderer management APIs

## Discussion

Minutes:

1. Welcome Grant Stenfield.
2. New Fabric Gateway on the peer- benefits: Eliminates alot of client-side overhead.  Every peer will automatically be a gateway peer
3. Translation Campaign: Next steps: blog created by this group using the quotes... from the translators.
4. Future Documentation Meetup anyone? - where we can talk more about doc work. Get some good visibility. Watched by 100s of peopl on YouTube channel. An oppportunity to invite more people to this group. Walk-through, demo. Not an enormous slide presentation. Review the docs available, how to contribute, ... etc. Possibly in March. Next step: anyone one interested in being a point person contact David.
5. What to do with the existing create a channel tutorial that was added for the osnadmin API. Need to keep the content  around what to do if you have an existing ordering service - operations guide thing. Chris is about to try this.  May be able to simulate in the new VS Code Extension. Look forward to Chri's feedback around this.
6. Grant:
   
   1. Used the Test network and commercial paper OK. Tried production deployment guide. Using Fabric v2.2. Certs setup and intermediate CA were OK and enroll users. Setting up the ordering service was not successful. Needed more step by step instructions.
   2. Howdo I  know which Fabric version to try?
   3. In previous Fabric v2.2, you had to go through all the steps to create a genesis block before you deploy your ordering service. In v2.3  the overall proces is greatly simplified.
   4. Grant will try out the v2.3 of the tutorial here: [https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.3/deployorderer/ordererdeploy.html](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.3/deployorderer/ordererdeploy.html)
   5. Expressed the need for something more for Production deployment on K8s or Docker. Docs have no info/no recommendations for cloud env.
   6. Alternative: MiniFab is based on K8s. It's the test network on k8s. There is a recording about Minifabric at:
   7. On MacBook or windows you can use MiniKube.
   8. Chris reminded him on k8s, You need to become very familiar with PVS and where you will store certs.
