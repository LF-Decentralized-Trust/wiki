- Release status: Pam/Joe: Dashboard: [https://jira.hyperledger.org/secure/Dashboard.jspa?selectPageId=10104](https://jira.hyperledger.org/secure/Dashboard.jspa?selectPageId=10104)

    - Will this be the new standard for adding peers from a new org?

- Promoting Fabric Translations - David Boswell
  
  - Promoting translated docs
    
    - Translating the Hyperledger home page and linking to the docs:
      
      - [Spanish translation just went live](https://es.hyperledger.org/)
      - There is a 'Resources in your language' section on translated pages where we can point to translated docs, translation working groups, language specific chat channels and more
      - To add a new language, just [fill out this form with the translated text](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1KqD_qYH42HqYm_mZQok3bdfS-Dv7g48TYIVBXZqlCLs/edit)
    - Using Hyperledger's social media – all translation teams are welcome to send David (dboswell at linuxfoundation dot org) translated tweets about their work on he can post those
  - Promoting translation contribution opportunities to help existing translation groups and to start new ones
    
    - We had talked about doing a contribution campaign.  For that, our marketing lead just needs a **blog post and a how to video about how to contribute to translations**.
    - Most of this content already exists in the Contribution guide, so is someone interested in drafting a blog post based on that?  There was also talk of translation groups creating a how to video but I'm not sure of the status for that.
    - Picking a time frame for this so our marketing lead can get that scheduled.
- International languages(standing topic)
  
  - *Remind translators that if they are maintainers that after they approve a PR they can user the \`doc-merge\` label on a PR to merge it.*
