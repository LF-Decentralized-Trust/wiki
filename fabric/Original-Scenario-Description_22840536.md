Attached to this page is the original scenario description that captured all discussions from Hyperledger Global Forum (Basel 2018) and online within the working group. This is the scenario descriptions and proposals as was described in the working group meeting on 2019-01-31. See attached [PDF document](attachments/22840536/22840538.pdf).

As next step, the content of this document is broken down into Wiki pages, so that it can be directly edited, worked on and then later transferred into official Fabric documentation.
