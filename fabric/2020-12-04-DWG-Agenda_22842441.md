## Discussion

Minutes:

1. Fabric deployment guide - backup and recovery - rolling updates and rolling back - current snapshot capability is just a way to add a peer.
   
   1. Need more info on the recommended steps in Fabric to backup your ledger before you upgrade.
2. Fabric samples - New sample for attribute based access control in the asset transfer series. PR went in yesterday  [https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/pull/375](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/pull/375) 
   
   1. Is there a plan to have another branch of Fabric samples? Cut the 2.2 branch and then update the dependencies to 2.3 and create a 2.3 branch
   2. need to check doc links which go to a specific branch of samples.
3. Programming model - GO SDK pre-release, Andrew Coleman coming next week to talk about this for future Fabric release.
4. Doc translation campaign - approval to work with videographer. No timeline yet. More updates next week.
5. Customers have to constantly upgrade to keep up with new changes.
6. Rebase content during System channel updates - to clean up some of this
7. Arch ref - learning fabric vs. using fabric.  re-architect the architecture section
   
   1. Transaction flow is not arch ref.
   2. Suggestion: Move everything into Operation guide
   3. and use the [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.10228.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.10228.pdf) arch paper as the arch ref
8. Nik - outside of Fabric - docs get much worse... Caliper, Explorer - how to keep other projects up to date.... they leave alot to be desired. If we are promoting these tools as standards the docs need to improve.
9. 2021 Goals further:
   
   1. Encouraging users to move up to latest release
