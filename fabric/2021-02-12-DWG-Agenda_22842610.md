## Discussion

Minutes:

1. Chris - move to next week's agend for demo with minikube
   
   1. tying IOT devices carbon sensors to HLF
2. Grant Steinfeld -
   
   1. Starting deployment again from scratch using Fabric v2.3.1
   2. was confused by refs to system channel in orderer deployment guide
   3. still need anchor peers? yes
   4. Minifab (Tong Li) - Everything installed fine except the last part -  posted questions for help. Could be a Docker 3 problem?
   5. VS Code extension - very useful for creating smart contract
   6. YouTube videos from Chris
   7. Suggestion: Want to customize org1.example.com - set it as an env variable instead for customer demos
   8. Fabcar sample was useful years ago
3. Jim - finishing a Fabric v2.2 interested in the Samples...
4. David Boswell work on LF - supporting community members -
   
   1. we have very active virtual meetup community feel fre to join -
      
      1. [Virtual LF Decentralized Trust Meetups](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/events/pages/21790799/Virtual+LF+Decentralized+Trust+Meetups)
      2. [dboswell@linuxfoundation.org](mailto:dboswell@linuxfoundation.org)
5. Developing Applications topic
   
   1. tied to commercial paper sample.
   2. Chris - I use the node SDK and Fabric contract API docs for this info
6. Jim - is there an offchain sample? Yes: [https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/tree/master/off\_chain\_data](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/tree/master/off_chain_data)
   
   1. mongo db vs. blockchain -  blockchain is distributed db - a connected network that is trusted and secure
   2. Chris - samples don't cover registering/enrolling users very well. It's the operational things that can trip you up.
   3. Nik - Building a distributed Auction example.
   4. Learning curve is steep, getting easier, Fabric Gateway should be able to help.
