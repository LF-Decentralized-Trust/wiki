## Discussion

Minutes:

1. System Channel removal almost done.
   
   1. Need to do FAQ and probably won't do the Migrating from Kafka to Raft [kafka\_raft\_migration.md](http://kafka_raft_migration.md). It should be removed.
   2. Configuring and operating a Raft ordering service [raft\_configuration.md](http://raft_configuration.md) - consider removing and ensuring all content is addressed in a single place in the deployment guide.
2. Samples updates - remove from agenda
3. Nik brought up the need for more Hyperledger Interoperability between projects such as Indy and Ursa for crypto
   
   1. How  to get all of these to  work together?
   2. Currently, the projects are silod
   3. The Community is not structured to support interop.
   4. Are there specific themes to start with?
   5. Maybe start a Working group [https://wiki.hyperledger.org/#Hyperledger-WorkingGroups](https://wiki.hyperledger.org/#Hyperledger-WorkingGroups) for this
4. Deployment Guide Feedback - Nik
   
   1. Deployed CA/peer/orderer with K8s
   2. 3 steps to Deployment
      
      1. Understand the test network - how the scripts work, the, env variables, etc.
      2. Read the Deploymennt guide
      3. Learn k8s - accenture blog post that was helpful [https://accenture.github.io/blog/2019/06/25/hl-fabric-meets-kubernetes.html](https://accenture.github.io/blog/2019/06/25/hl-fabric-meets-kubernetes.html)
   3. Liked the setup of the Deployment Guide overall
   4. Like the checklists
   5. Missing
      
      1. For the CA, there is a diaspora of docs that could be better aligned.
      2. Domain name management - example.com vs. difft domains of  a real company
      3. Chaincode: Mounting docker.sock vs.external builder
5. Chris Gabriel - Playing around with rust + wasm - containerless and serverless. Will be the future of services like this.
6. Fabric translation - David
   
   1. video draft
   2. Script is coming along
   3. Ready to start working with Translators in coming weeks.
