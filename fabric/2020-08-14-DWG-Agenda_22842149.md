## Discussion

**Eastern hemisphere call**

1. &lt;Minutes&gt;
   

**Western hemisphere call**

1. Release update:
   
   1. mirBFT - targettng a first push of the material at end of Sept and then work on integrating with Fabric.
   2. Channel participation api - still targeted for v2.3
   3. Config trans. lib - makes channel updates easier.
   4. Deployment Guide - Peer - share on next week's call
   5. Sample's Workgroup - Writing your first application is done on the master branch, Next up refactoring chaincode4developers to writing your first smart contract.
   6. ledger checkpoing and pruning - still targeted for v2.3
   7. programming model - no updates.
   8. Jim: What are the items being targeted for v3? We have no insight into that  - we should ask on the next contributor call.
2. Asian online study circle - eastern hemisphere call
3. Containerizing your local build Claudio Ceballos Paz - Latin Chapter
   
   01. Dockerized the entire process.
   02. created a docker-compose file, added all the dependencies, go to translation repo...
   03. then run docker-compose build
   04. docker-compose up
   05. people don't need to install anything in their local dev env except Docker.
   06. then cd docs/es build and then view the generated .html file...
   07. very small effort to get a build - just install docker
   08. can be used with regular english builds of the docs and the language builds
   09. Claudio will create a PR and show next week.
   10. He'll create a make file that we can run.
   11. great solution for translators, who are running on different OS -
   12. Build of Peer commands (make help-docs) requires Go v1.14 to build. Not recommended to go to Go v1.5 at this time.
4. Translation status:
   
   1. renato: Needs help from Brett and Ry on the CI/CD pipeline.
5. Fabric Samples status (Chris)
   
   1. asset-transfter-basic, go version added this week.
   2. you can call any chaincode from any application type. so go application calls a typescript chaincode.
   3. Writing your first application tutorial links need to be updated.
   4. Planning to make  a helper video for github contributions.
6. Promoting translations
   
   1. Hyperledger website to be a landing page for translation - 3 more groups want to do translations. malayalam, frensh, spanish. Will show next week.
   2. Does auto language detection work on the page, rather than making people select the language from the drop-down.
   3. no blog/video update until Anthony comes back.
7. Retiring older version of the docs -
   
   1. people are still finding older versions of our docs clicking on them/using them.
   2. There is no plan to remove old Fabric \*\*code\** versions. But we might be able to archive (and redirect) old docs to new docs.
   3. Potentially add a banner to the top of the doc
   4. See how CouchDB does it with banner at top and link to latest content:  [https://docs.couchdb.org/en/1.6.1/api/index.html](https://docs.couchdb.org/en/1.6.1/api/index.html)
   5. Redirect might be more effective than a banner.

8\. Quick tour of google analytics where you can see users access v1.1 and v1.2 versions of the docs. If you are interested in accessing  this page, send david boswell a request [dboswell@linuxfoundation.org](mailto:dboswell@linuxfoundation.org). Ry Jones (@rjones) on Rocketchat can also give access. Page provides good insight as to most popular topics.

9\. Claudio - Latin group will be hosting a class next week on Fabric and would be good to get the es version of the docs published for that. They need to CI/CD pipeline just like pt-BR content.

10.. New linux foundation article on private data is published. [https://thenewstack.io/using-private-data-collections-in-hyperledger-fabric/](https://thenewstack.io/using-private-data-collections-in-hyperledger-fabric/)
