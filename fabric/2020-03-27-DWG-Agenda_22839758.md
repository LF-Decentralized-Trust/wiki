## Announcements

1. Release status: Pam/Joe
   
   1. Dashboard: [https://jira.hyperledger.org/secure/Dashboard.jspa?selectPageId=10104](https://jira.hyperledger.org/secure/Dashboard.jspa?selectPageId=10104)
   2. Fabric 2.1 coming out in April. Will contain minor improvements to Fabric 2.0 and work on stabilizing 2.x to be an LTS release.
   3. Ledger checkpoint then archive   - starting with checkpointing first and pruning/archive will come later. Ability to checkpoint a channel so genesis block is not required.
   4. BFT - Still investigating mirBFT.. Was shared at Hyperledger Global Forum.
      
   5. Config Transaction Library RFC: [https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-rfcs/pull/25/files](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-rfcs/pull/25/files)
2. LTS RFC - [https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-rfcs/pull/23.](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-rfcs/pull/23#pullrequestreview-378901553) Dave plans to publish on Fabric wiki and link to it from the Fabric Girhub README.
   
3. Creating a channel tutorial.
4. New CC Lifecycle video on YouTube: [https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/chaincode\_lifecycle.html#more-information](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/chaincode_lifecycle.html#more-information)
   
5. Status of video that we made on last weeks meeting - and how do we make sure user's see it?

## Discussion

1. Release status: Pam/Joe
   
   1. Looking at Mir BFT – high throughput for ordering service nodes. RFC soon.  Multiple leaders but otherwise similar compared to Raft.
      
      1. Discussion on multiple consensus models - will be maintained
   2. Config transaction library RFC now present
      
      1. Easier to work with channels in Fabric
      2. Unlikely to make 2.1
   3. 2.1 planned for April
   4. Outlook as 2.2 as a stable release
      
      1. All 2.x needs to be complete
      2. Then period of stability before LTS
      3. 2.x needs to be complete before LTS is discussed, not driven by date
   5. Network deployment guide work continuing
   6. CA deployment also progressing 
      
      1. Add peer and ordering after this
      2. Add policies later in this discussion, including planning
   7. Ledger checkpoint and pruning
      
      1. Will start with checkpointing first!
   8. SDK progress is good
   9. BYFN and Test net progressing well
      
      1. BYFN will deprecate in 2.0
      2. How much should be removed from docs
      3. Preference is to deprecate not remove
      4. Deprecated features in next release new features
2. LTS discussion, Pam/Joe
   
   1. Covered [https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-rfcs/pull/23](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-rfcs/pull/23#pullrequestreview-378901553)
   2. Declaring pre end of version LTS
   3. Multiple LTS
   4. 2.1 release in April
      
      1. Minor improvements and bug fixes from 2.0
      2. No major new function before LTS
3. Creating a channel tutorial, Nik
   
   01. Walkthrough of current updates in tutorial
   02. Chris issues in Kubernetes with channel create
       
       1. default policies are deprecated
   03. Policies moved to separate section
   04. More focus on consortia
   05. Peer commands follow, including anchors
   06. Jim – this is helpful for new people to get going, mixing concepts with code
   07. Custom policy discussion
       
       1. Helpful to get concrete understanding on policies
   08. Discussion on structure of tutorial – is it multiple tutorials
   09. Jim – importance of this tutorial being fully replicable
       
       1. How can it help as a guide for debugging real-world networks
   10. MSP topic is very important as relates to this information
       
       1. This tutorial will not be perfect for production – related to deployment guide
       2. Disclaimer that this tutorial is for docker network, but to help with production systems it should link to MSP topics
4. Chris Gabriel discussion on kubernetes issues
   
   1. Walk through on kubernetes examples
   2. Very different when using Fabric CA
   3. Lots of considerations for kubernetes
   4. Needs to be discussed on follow up calls
   5. See video for example.
