# Hyperledger Fabric : Hyperledger Fabric Roadmap

Created by Tracy Kuhrt, last modified by David Enyeart on Feb 21, 2024

The short term roadmap can be viewed as a list of [GitHub issues with Epic label](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/labels/Epic) with more details presented as a [Zenhub board](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/fabric-57c43689b6f3d8060d082cf1/board). New features are proposed and discussed through an [RFC process](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-rfcs), new RFCs from the community are welcome. Typically Epics are created after an RFC is approved and merged.

Longer term priorities that have not yet gone through the RFC process are [discussed in the community](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/CONTRIBUTING.html#communications-and-getting-help) and in [contributor meetings](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/fabric/Contributor+Meetings), new ideas are welcome in either forum.

The Hyperledger Fabric maintainers produce minor releases to deliver the release themes on the roadmap as they become ready. Other improvements and fixes are delivered as patch releases against the most recent long-term support release and latest release.

See [prior release notes](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/releases) for release history and content. Prior release documentation can be found in the [documentation links](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric#documentation-getting-started-and-developer-guides).
