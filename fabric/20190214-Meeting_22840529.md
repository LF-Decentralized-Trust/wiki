1. Chaincode Interface
   
   1. Chaincode files were uploaded to the wiki for evaluation.
   2. The WG reviewed the chaincode workflow using the workflow diagram.
   3. Muralidharan raised the concern that maps could be non-deterministic and could lead to ambiguous write sets.
      
      The Go json documentation states:Â *Map values encode as JSON objects. \[...] The map keys are sorted and used as JSON object keys \[...]*
   4. Shan asked for a way to delete proposals when finished or no more relevant so that the state will not be messed up.
   5. Tong mentioned that the chaincode should contain more comments.
2. Next Steps

   2. Update the workflow to include the delete step.
