  - We had discussed having a Translator badge (among other possible badges) and it sounds like that may be too specific.  I wanted to check back in about what type of badge would work better?
    
    - One option would be to have a Fabric Documentation badge that could be issued to people making a range of documentation related contributions
    - Another option would be to have a Fabric Contributor badge that could be issued to people making documentation contributions or other Fabric related contributions
- Reminder: Cherry-picking doc PR's back to previous branches. @Mergifyio backport release-x.y
- Retiring Fabric docs versions 1.1/1.2/1.3 - Banner not working in RTD.

## Discussion

**Eastern hemisphere call**

1. &lt;minutes&gt;

**Western hemisphere call**

1. Chris G blog on private data:  [https://www.linkedin.com/posts/chris-gabriel\_hyperledger-on-twitter-activity-6701441156414287872-XI9e](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/chris-gabriel_hyperledger-on-twitter-activity-6701441156414287872-XI9e)
2. New Fabric Jira for Channel Participation API
   
   1. Need to also consider updates to the Samples.
   2. We should bring this up on the next Fabric Contributors call. What is the strategy around the removal of the System Channel in terms of coexistence and deprecation?
   3. Also makes the Fabric Deprecations page even more important.
   4. Should we have a standing Documentation work item on the Contributors call?
   5. Jim: Really need a picture of the Fabric Strategic Plan vs. the Tactical plan.
3. Chris local build process update: [https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs\_guide.html?highlight=local%20build#building-locally](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs_guide.html?highlight=local%20build#building-locally)
   
   1. When you clone Fabric, to your local drive, and you setup your sphinx build, and follow instructions to Build locally:
      
      1. You need to run: \`pip3 install sphinx-rtd-theme\`.
      2. Then you can run \`pipenv shell\`.
      3. Then run make html in the fabric/docs folder.
   
   <!--THE END-->
   
   1. Samples update
      
      1. Tutorials - Refactoring chaincode4developers was turned into Writing your first chaincode in 2.2 and Master branch.
         
         1. New: Added content about the high level contract API
         2. Patterned the tutorial after the new basic asset transfer sample.
         3. Added details on each function call.
      2. All the tutorials have been updated now: Using Fabric test network, Deploying a smart contract, Writing your first Application, and Writing your first chaincode
4. Peer deployment guide: Draft PR created [https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/pull/1789](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/pull/1789)
   
   1. Updated Deploying a Production network.
      
      1. Embedded toc links to detail instructions inside each step. Very slick!
   2. New Planning for a Peer topic. Decisions you need to make before you deploy a peer.
   3. New Peer planning checklist doc.
   4. Next: Peer deployment guide.
   5. Chris Need section on alternative syntax when you do an override of the environment variables. If you are putting it k8s or docker compose file - how to build out the environment variables. You can infer how to build them.
   6. Peer sampleconfig.yaml does not include all the parameters. Look at the core.yaml in the peer binary config folder instead.
   7. Nik: What are the challenges with deploying fabric in K8s? HA, running multiple replica sets on different VMs, What happens when there is node failure - you can configure this in K8s. A big challenge is the sequence in which you do things.  Prioritizing deployment of CA, creating certs, configuring Node OUs.. Coordinating with other organizations.
5. Promoting translations - David
   
   1. How to make translated docs discoverable? Let him know when a new Language is ready to publish. ==&gt; Publish on HL social media channel, also Hyperledger landing page.
6. How to recognize contributors to the DWG:
   
   1. Pilot the process... group level (Documentation, translation) vs. Project (Fabric).
   2. Translation badge is too specific.
   3. Fabric documentation badge issued to people making a range of documentation related contribution - group specific rather than task specific.
   4. Or could do overall Fabric contributor badge -
   5. What do other open source projects do? range - depends on how many badge types/how granular. Set criteria and then monitor.
   6. Ideally this is an automated recognition.
   7. Should this be brought up on contributors call?
   8. David to present again next week and we provide feedback - Agreed to have a think on this and a  longer discussion next week.
   9. Consider that people doing the translating are not necessarily the person making the commits. Need to recognize the right contributors.
