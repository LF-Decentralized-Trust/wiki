## Discussion

1. Joe walked us through the dashboard and recapped the 2.1 upgrade process. Reminder: For 2.0 → 2.1 upgrade process, just update the binaries, no update to the capabilities.
2. David Boswell -
   
   01. Previously worked for Mozilla and now works for LF. His role works with 170 groups/80 countries
   02. Could we harness these people to do the translations?
   03. Tap into Fabric meetups worldwide, if you are looking to do more.. point them to our l10 page... once it exists.
   04. Showed web page how mozilla supports the l10n  - very mature example of the process. Vision of what it might look like - what we are working towards, we would do a smaller version and scale up.
   05. What are the roles the translators perform? Who owns the content? Delegation of respnsibility
   06. Use testing and tooling to ensure currency of l10 content - Pontoon tooling shows status of content and last activity
   07. Do we have a targeted list of languages? Start with a small list...
   08. Who owns the translation process? What are the various roles? How is it tested/verified? How is it maintained? How to scale? What is the recommended tooling?
   09. If we start with a skeleton process and expand from there. Pam to contact Chinese translators once again...
   10. Nik: Can we incentivize contributors?
   11. Translation drives adoption around the world, and then contribution.
   12. Jim: What are the top 3 languages outside of English? anecdotally - Chinese, Spanish, pt-BR? Urdu... Which ones to target?
3. Internals doc
   
   1. Excellent detailed content -
   2. Should we link to it from Fabric docs as reference material? Add a warning: this is an as-is doc...
   3. How to maintain it?
   4. Remember this is for Fabric v1.4 not 2.x
   5. Target audience: low-level content for someone who needs to really understand the internals of Fabric - maybe for high-performance reasons, or chaincode developer
4. Fabric performance docs
   
   1. From the contributors call
      
      1. Performance Best Practices in Hyperledger Fabric:
         
         Part I: Introduction. [https://adlrocha.substack.com/p/adlrocha-performance-best-practices](https://adlrocha.substack.com/p/adlrocha-performance-best-practices)
         
         Part II: Architecture and Infrastructure [https://adlrocha.substack.com/p/adlrocha-performance-best-practices-72e](https://adlrocha.substack.com/p/adlrocha-performance-best-practices-72e)
         
         Part III: Protocol and Chaincodes [https://adlrocha.substack.com/p/adlrocha-performance-best-practices-321](https://adlrocha.substack.com/p/adlrocha-performance-best-practices-321)
         
         Part IV: The SDK [https://adlrocha.substack.com/p/adlrocha-performance-best-practices-50a](https://adlrocha.substack.com/p/adlrocha-performance-best-practices-50a)
   2. What is the Status of Nik Lincolns work for v2.0? Would be good to get him back on this call to share.
