## Announcements

This week's agenda is:

1. V2.0 release status: Pam/Joe
   
   1. v1.4.4 targeted for November (minor) bug fixes and shifts fabric docker images from ubuntu to debian:buster-20190910-slim - smaller images, more secure 
      
   2. code-complete v2.0 beta Dec 2019 without the config updates, so that we can get back to a release cadence and start moving forward with some of the other important post-v2.0 features.
      
   3. final v2.0 release in the new year (including Upgrade documentation) (config updates will be part of v3.0).
      
   4. Node sdk v2.0 refactoring - in master split fabric-client into fabric-base (for transactions) and fabric-admin (for v2.0 lifecycle support)  - Brett
