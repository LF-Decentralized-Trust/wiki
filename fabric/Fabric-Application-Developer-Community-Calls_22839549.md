\- helping the worldwide the developer community grow in their development journey (eg. developing applications, smart contracts)   
\- help app developers understand / hear more on exciting new things in Fabric, eg. features upcoming or work in progress..  
\- help foster more interest, best practices etc in developing applications (eg developing solutions, use cases) with Hyperledger Fabric.  
\- opportunity to ask questions of the Fabric Dev team responsible for Contracts or SDK side of Fabric eg. share your experiences developing solutions with Fabric
