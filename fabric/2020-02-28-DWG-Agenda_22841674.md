## Discussion

1. Release Status
   
   1. 1.4.6 release due to bug fix
   2. Same reason for 2.0.1 release
   3. See link for details
   4. Request for explicit 2.1 dashboard
   5. Contributer's call/meeting on Wednesday will discuss these issues
   6. 2.1 content to be declared

   4. High level topic in Docs to point to a table in GitHub
3. Discussion on Tokens from EHC
   
   1. ERC20
   2. TTI
   3. Simulation in Fabric
   4. Ethereum interop level 1 and 2
   5. SDK convergence discussed
   6. Jim: Forbes article discussed. Fabric strong in Supply chain, but not in financial area - is this due to lack of tokens?
      
      1. [https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeldelcastillo/2020/02/19/blockchain-50/#1f3cfeec7553](https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeldelcastillo/2020/02/19/blockchain-50/#1f3cfeec7553)
   7. Jim: not enough concrete information on roadmap
   8. Are there coding examples of how to do tokens in Fabric today, per Commercial paper for example? Using ERC20, TTI styles would help
   9. This would help in advance of something built into Fabric
4. Deployment Guide status
   
   1. Lots of work in progress
   2. Looked at link: [https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/deployment\_guide\_overview.html](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/deployment_guide_overview.html)
      
      1. Lots of information here
      2. Collaboration encouraged. This is a first step

      01. Lots of solid information being covered
      02. Will become definitive way to deploy CA
