# Hyperledger Fabric : 20190221 Meeting

Created by Tong Li, last modified by Brian Brian on Feb 22, 2019

Agenda:

1. Decide on the name for the chaincode
   
   1. Interop chaincode (iocc?)
   2. org management chaincode (omcc)
   3. OrgJoin chaincode (occ)
   4. interop management chaincode (imcc)
   5. consortium management chaincode (cmcc)
2. Continue the chaincode interface discussion
   
   1. When necessary signatures collected, who will eventually submit the channel update?
   2. Should it be made automatically in this chaincode? Like whenever a new signature gets added, the chaincode will check if the channel update should be submitted?
   3. Should it be a method on Invoke to do the final step?
3. Review proposal document comments
4. Dennis show the steps to create needed artifacts for new peer

Meeting minutes: Brian Mckellar (SAP)

1. Naming decision: consortium management chaincode (cmcc)
2. Chaincode will collect signatures. The decision of when we have enough signatures is decided by the specific consortium (business decision) and then the channel update is done outside of the management chaincode scope. (Alternative of using a system chaincode was touched upon, but decided out of scope for the current approach.)
3. Comments accepted and will be integrated.
4. Presentation done by Dennis, [PDF attached to WIKI page](attachments/22840615/22840668.pdf).
