**Western hemisphere call**

1. Release status:
   
   1. mirBFT work continues - exciting performance based enhancements ....
   2. Channel Participation api - don't have to use System Channel anymore
      
      1. need to consider what kind of updates are required. New sample? Update existing test network.
   3. Transaction Library  simplifies transaction updates - gathering feedback from users
   4. Fabric deployment guide - progressing well
      
      1. Dave Enyeart provided a table of override parms for the peer.
   5. Samples - Write your first application has been rewritten by Chris. More consumable.
   6. Snapshot and checkpoint - snapshot work planned to be delivered in Fabric v2.3
   7. Programming model - Go SDK is still in Beta
2. Asia Pacific study circle - going through the Fabric docs.. See Eastern Hemishpehere call for details.
3. Women in Blockchain. See Eastern Hemisphere call for details.
4. Language update.
   
   1. pt-BR Renato - merged this week.
      
      1. Need help to make CI/CD pipeline from Brett Logan.
      2. Spanish PR needs to be approved. Need their own CodeOwners file. Pam to investigate. PR [https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-docs-i18n/pull/65](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-docs-i18n/pull/65)
      3. latin america translation group has a new way of translation  that simplifies and speeds up the process- renato to share on future call.
5. Samples status (Chris)
   
   1. Github Fabric samples see Asset-transfer-basic sample replaces fabcar.
   2. Includes both application and chaincode in multiple languages
   3. Chris working on the javascript application
   4. Updated the fabric test network tutorial and writing your first application tutorial - removed all references to Fabcar (in master branch0
   5. Tutorial steps through how to run the applicaiton and the chaincode.
   6. Not using cryptogen anymore!
   7. New: Clarifies that when the register and enroll occurs it happens between application and the CA and not the application and the chaincode.
   8. Next up: refactoring chaincode for developers → Writing your first chaincode, will replace simple-asset chaincode with asset-tansfer-basic sample.
   9. Need to update the README in Fabric samples that Fabcar is deprecated.
6. Language anchors -
   
   1. Documentation anchors are derived from the name of the section heading. Problem for translators because when they translate headings the links break.
   2. There may not be 1 solution for this problem.
      
      1. Renato has a solution that works for him (Establishing own anchors.)
      2. Broken link checker would help here.
      3. Chris - but there is more than just an anchor problem. Mix of rst and md, the procedure is not the same. Anchors are derived when the HTML is built.
         
         1. Need to standardize and agree on anchors.
         2. RST: H1 designated by equal sign row ======, H2 designated by dashes ---- Build is not recognizing the dashes and spits out errors. When we fix the anchor problem we should fix this too.
   3. This is a significant doc issue.
7. Promoting translations -
   
   1. Renato has translated the [www.hyplerledger.org](http://www.hyplerledger.org) home page. Take a look at  pt-br.hyperledger.org
   2. What other resources do the translators want to translate?
   3. How do we make sure people see translations? Learn about translation effort join?
   4. We have a process now thanks to Renato, if other language teams want to provide a home page translation they can. Just need to [fill out this form and we'll get a new page live!](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1KqD_qYH42HqYm_mZQok3bdfS-Dv7g48TYIVBXZqlCLs/edit)
   5. Ideally this would come from a known actor in one of the language groups.
   6. Ties into google analytics work - how are people finding these pages?
8. Broken link checker
   
   1. Broken link checker is almost back in action - thanks to Brett who has a wip PR to address this.
   2. He ended up having to downgrade the sphinx level from 1.7 to 1.4 to get it to work agin
   3. He is verifying it will not affect the language Malayalam translation
   4. His pr addresses all the 40 broken links from Chris’ spreadsheet (most were false positives)
   5. Now when you submit a PR borken links will be flagged in the doc build report.
   6. But will not block the merge of the PR
   7. When can we retire/archive 1.1/1.2/1.3 versions of the docs? We need a deprecation schedule. Rec to bring up on next contributors call. What is the long term support strategy here. If someone is using these docs there should be a huge deprecation notice on the page.
