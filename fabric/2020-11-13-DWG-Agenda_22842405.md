## Discussion

Minutes:

1. Samples - Nik
   
   1. Fairly finished for now. Mostly wrapped up so no new status.
2. LF/HLF - David
   
   1. We have the how to docs, now we need more of a piece that explains Why?  - video + blog post
   2. A way to feature everyone - that has contributed/ Members from each translation team contribute as well.
   3. Need professional videographer to help - potentially find a contact to find out video requirements and reach out to the different translation working groups
   4. Share it early next year.
   5. Claudio  expressed an interest in contributing as well (via Rocketchat)
   6. Plan to email specific guidance and timeline soon to those members who have expressed interest. David also suggested posting it on their Wikis for broader awareness and contribution.
3. Channel Participation API tutorial work wrapping up for GA next week.
4. Auction Sample - Nik [https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/tree/master/auction](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/tree/master/auction)
   
   1. Background - While the auction is ongoing - each buyer joins the auction but the bids are hashed. You can't see what others are bidding or change your bid. When the auction is closed you reveal your bid. The hash that is on your bid freezes your bid so you cannot change it.
   2. CA driven. Uses state-based endorsement.
      
      01. Seller creates the auction
      02. Auction is open
      03. Buyers can bid
      04. bidder 1 - create bid with bid id and add it to the auction. There is a hash of the bid rather than the bid
      05. more bidders add their bid
      06. whenever a bidder to org2 adds a bid it adds their organization
      07. Only the seller can close the auction.
      08. Each bidder then Reveals their bid -
          
          1. hash of bid has to match with the hash that was  added to the autction and the has on the blockchain ledger (it has not changed since you bid)
      09. Auction looks for the highest revealed bid - and is awarded the auction
      10. If you try to end the auction prematurely  - can't give away the asset until all bidders have revealed their bid.
   3. This sample contains a series of applications for a given function that can be used by any participant/identity.
   4. There is also a Dutch auction sample which is more complicated.
5. Google Analytics - contact David Boswell if you want access.
   
   1. overall y2y viewers is down from about 33K last year to 21K now.
   2. Time spent per page is about 5 mins which is pretty good.
   3. Bounce rate about 50%
   4. Appears that most users are from Eastern Hemipshere - underscoring the importance of content translation
   5. Looks like fewer people are now accessing the earlier 1.1/1.2/1.3 versions of the docs which is good to see.
   6. Most users 91% appear to be accessing the content from a desktop browser as opposed to a mobile device/tablet.
