## Discussion

Minutes:

1. Internationalization
   
   1. Renato: continued progress. Still working alone and could use help. David can potentially broadcast the need.
   2. Claudio:next week Spanish wg meetup, adding more people from Madras meetup.
2. David Boswell: more visible we can become around translations
   
   1. If we want to be a little more structured - Resources in your language good place to add a link to your languages [https://fr.hyperledger.org/](https://fr.hyperledger.org/)
   2. German coming soon
   3. Contribution campaign planned for January/February timeline - video or some other assets - need content to be ready early next year
3. Ledger snapshot
   
   1. Google doc started [![](plugins/servlet/confluence/placeholder/unknown-macro)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FHogrxNgKQH8QDdXg9ICXdKlYvLUprqQLiOxf_w9QDU/edit?usp=sharing)
   2. Operations guide instead of a tutorial
      
      1. Not really appropriate for test network - due to interactions between different organizations.
      2. Take a snapshot of all the blocks, hash, transmit out of band,
      3. orgs can compare their state db's to see if any fork or corruptions
      4. other org can point to snapshot.
4. Channel participation API - way to create a channel without a system channel
   
   1. Stategy [![](plugins/servlet/confluence/placeholder/unknown-macro)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OGDb43CNkBzHWVonPI5kphATWb_iOFV5Hc7rkDXsyX4/edit?usp=sharing)
   2. Trying to agree upon terminoloigy/What to call this
   3. More of the burden is now on the peer orgs
   4. Creating a new create a channel tutorialÂ  [![](plugins/servlet/confluence/placeholder/unknown-macro)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1e4sqgPgAvbmFpK_WiwBwGBhs6Oqch2oMjRFJ-LYoVuQ/edit?usp=sharing)
5. Orderer deployment guide
   
   1. New planning topic - similar to peer [![](plugins/servlet/confluence/placeholder/unknown-macro)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1npY3V8AlIZ3dJ3aByMuKm8SJZYeYY4NXTItULVYvO2U/edit?usp=sharing)
      
      1. This process describes the process for using a system channel. Update after 2.3 GA when channel participation API is available
      2. We need will need to add a production profile in configtx.yaml
      3. sizing - nodes are on multiple channels, will be having ledgers on every channel - alot of blocks
      4. Cluster considerations - how many nodes are practical to have on a particular ordering service? Increased message traffic as # channels grow.
   2. Checklist [![](plugins/servlet/confluence/placeholder/unknown-macro)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Sa2o31jziVGhzUPAzward4IxePSpJtI0m9aJtK4tHPQ/edit?usp=sharing)
      
      1. Again similar to peer and CA deployment guides we will highlight the most important settings for a production env
      2. Currently in the process of scoping the list of settings to highlight.
      3. Chris demo
      4. Troubleshooting topics will be included
6. Getting started
   
   1. Rob perspective: I like to look at code to understand what is going on. so I need to be able to see the code too. So that's why I've included everything here.
   2. Pam: don't want it make it hard for existing users to find the cURL command
   3. Jim: different types of users - some people just want a demo model (to try out tutorials or samples), kick something up quickly. vs. I am new developer.
