# Hyperledger Fabric : Hyperledger Fabric SDKs

Created by Tracy Kuhrt, last modified by Mark S. Lewis on Sep 20, 2024

## Current

From Hyperledger Fabric version 2.4, the only supported API for building client application to transact with a Fabric network is the [Fabric Gateway client API](Hyperledger-Fabric-Gateway-client-API_22842943.html). Implementations are provided in Go, Node (TypeScript / JavaScript) and Java. Full documentation can be found at:

- [https://hyperledger.github.io/fabric-gateway/](https://hyperledger.github.io/fabric-gateway/)

## Legacy

Legacy SDKs are available for Hyperledger Fabric versions prior to 2.4. Although these SDKs are no longer actively developed, they should continue to function with Fabric version 2.x releases. They will not work with Fabric 3.x using a BFT ordering service.
