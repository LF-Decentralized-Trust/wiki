# Hyperledger Fabric : Fabric Interop Working Group

Created by Tong Li, last modified by Arnaud J LE HORS on Jul 30, 2019

This working group was formed to promote the interoperability of Hyperledger Fabric network services. The primary goal of this working group is to ensure Fabric services provided by different vendors can work with each other with the following specific requirements:

1. Peers from a new organization can join a running fabric network, that is, a peer from a new organization can eventually participate in an existing channel to receive and respond Fabric blockchain transaction requests
2. A client application can perform Fabric SDK provided API calls against any of the peers and orderers to perform the following Fabric operations:
   
   1. Channel create
   2. Channel join
   3. Chaincode install (in golang or nodejs)
   4. Chaincode instantiate
   5. Chaincode invoke/query

To test the compliance of each service from a vendor, an new or existing orderering service shall be used. The orderering services should at least satisfy the following requirements:

1. Kafka based orderering service
2. TLS on
