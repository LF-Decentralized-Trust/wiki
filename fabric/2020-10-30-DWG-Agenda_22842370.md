## Discussion

Minutes:

1. Linux Foundation Marketing Campaign Update
   
   1. David - Investigating to see if we can get a video person.
   2. We have 5 interested parties representing Japan, China and India (Malayalam)
   3. Meeting on 11/10 for next steps
2. Channel Particpation API doc - Pam walked through doc in current state
   
   1. Recommendation to not break out the tutorial on a separate page
   2. Under **How this process differs from the legacy process:** where we talk about how we used to create a channel, also remind people what command was used then.
   3. Questions about the tech debt we are creating by referencing the System channel here when we ultimately have to remove it. Agreed it is required to include it in some form to differentiate the new process.
   4. If mutual TLS is enabled then the --clientAuth flag is also required on the commands
   5. Would the illustrations from the Contributor's call be helpful? Maybe one in step one and and second in step 2 showing the follower.
   6. Does the new Admin.ListenAddress include the host and port? Do we also need to mention the ListenAddress TLS flags when TLS is enabled?
   7. Talk to Joe about the suggestion to put the steps to remove the system channel from the existing ordering nodes/serve in the Upgrade documentation. When you upgrade to Fabric v2.3.0 if you want to take advantage of the channel
      
      participation API...
3. Getting Started - Rob walked through the Getting started topics PR: [https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/pull/1999](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/pull/1999)
   
   1. Need clarity on whether we really want the cURL to point to the latest (is this master? content) branch instead of the latest stable branch. Rob to check with Dave.
   2. Suggestion - On the layers page, maybe show the steps with a layered architecture diagram?
   3. Refactor links to the existing Writing your First Application tutorial since we are changing the title
   4. After these updates, Rob plans to take off the WIP flag and squash the commits.
