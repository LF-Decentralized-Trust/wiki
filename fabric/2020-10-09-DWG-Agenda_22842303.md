## Discussion

**Eastern hemisphere call**

1. &lt;minutes&gt;

**Western hemisphere call**

1. Samples Update:
   
   1. Nik: Private data - all changes merged into master - uses the new transaction flow, new smart contract, remove the existing README.
   2. Nik: Preview of an [auction sample](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/pull/321) is available.
   3. Token sample - not yet merged. asset-based token and utxo token. Waiting on Dave's edits.
2. ML: Test network troubleshooting: For file sharing Docker has switched to Fuse instead OSXFS which causes issues with the samples.
3. Rob - Fabric prereq proposal
   
   1. Existing Fabric developer instructions - based on OS
   2. Create a simple set of instructions on how to get started with installs
      
      1. broke it up into 4 steps (layers)
         
         1. install prereqs - break up by environment instead of sw - for fabric and samples
         2. Fabric network
         3. SDK and contract APIs
         4. application
   3. Getting started Add personas/ Target audience
