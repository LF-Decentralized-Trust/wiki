We are looking for another member from our team to join these calls. In the meantime the calls can continue every week at the same time/same zoom url with you all.You can reach each other on Rocket Chat. Go to the Fabric docs [https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and click the Rocket Chat icon:
