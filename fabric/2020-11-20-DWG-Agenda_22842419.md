## Discussion

Minutes:

1. Joe:Fabric docs proposal -
   
   1. Our proposal is this:
      
      1. 1. Where possible, we only mention the new process. For example, in this doc: [https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.2/capabilities\_concept.html#capability-configuration-groupings](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.2/capabilities_concept.html#capability-configuration-groupings), the references to the system channel aren’t particularly necessary and can be safely eliminated. However, because the “old” way is still, for the moment, supported, it can’t just be eliminated in every case. For example, in this doc: [https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.2/updating\_capabilities.html](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.2/updating_capabilities.html), it is still necessary that people have documentation of the old way if they wish to use it. In these cases,
      2. 2.We link to old branches of the doc where the system channel method is documented. We do not, in other words, put both methods in the same doc side by side (unless there is a good reason for it). The `latest` version of the docs as well as v2.3 will document the new process, and we will put a link at the top of these pages explaining that there is a old process (and briefly what that is) and a link to the 2.2 docs and where they can find documentation about it.
2. Swagger API doc coming for the Channel Participation API tutorial.
3. Samples update -
   
   1. Redoing the test network to use the new channel participation APIs.
4. David Boswell: Japanese version of the Fabric homepage is now available.
5. LF Doc translation campaign:
   
   1. We have reached out to a videographer for all the editing and are looking at the budget based on the esitmate.
   2. Would like to give firmer guidance to the translatorson how they can contribute in December along with the timeline, so they can work on it for early next year.
6. Jayakar Johnson- I would like to document the specifications of a Global Digital Healthcare Infrastructure Development Project for the Asynchronous Realtime transactions of Global Corona Virus Harmful Mutations Control (GCHMC) Program for UN; in Wiki for distributed developments. Shall I have guidance on this.  Best options are the channel on RocketChat and the Healthcare working group. Contact [dboswell@linuxfoundation.org](mailto:dboswell@linuxfoundation.org) for more informaiton.
7. Joe - Regarding the Fabric Roadmap - if there are specific items you'd like to see included in Fabric,  bring them to the next contributors call Dec 9th.
8. Chris Gabriel - IOT - I've configured a live sensor auto updating transactions on the blockchain proving blockchain and IOT integration. - Telecom special interest group is working on this as well.
9. Nik - I am learning how to deploy Fabric on Kubernetes and looking for more information  - check out .  Chris has some good information he received from IBM a while back that he can share directly with you.
