## Announcements

This week's agenda is:

1. V2.0 release status: Pam/Joe
   
   v1.4.4 targeted for November
   
   \- bug fixes
   
   \- Also shifts fabric docker images from ubuntu to debian:buster-20190910-slim - smaller images, more secure
   
   \- note - v2.0 shifts to alpine images - even smaller, even more secure
   
   v2.0.0-beta targeted for December, remaining items that we are trying to close down:
   
   \- external chaincode documentation
   
   \- external chaincode as a server
   
   \- state database cache for improved performance
   
   \- upgrade documentation
   
   \- node sdk v2.0 refactoring - in master split fabric-client into fabric-base (for transactions) and fabric-admin (for v2.0 lifecycle support)
   
   \- please go through Jira backlogs and help to highlight anything that needs to get in before v2.0
2. Chris Gabriel demo
3. The fabric-samples repository has moved over to use the combination of Github for code, and Azure pipelines for CI:
   
   fabric-sdk-java Move complete FABJ-486
   
   fabric-gateway-java Move complete FGJ-48
   
   fabric-sdk-node In progress FABN-1386

      1. Chris shared perspective that this is important for self-managed systems, i.e. base Fabric rather than a managed service
