# Hyperledger Fabric : CI Weekly Triage

Created by David Enyeart, last modified on Jan 20, 2020

In an effort to improve CI health, each week a different developer will take a lead role in triaging CI issues, driving down the issue backlog, and improving CI health.

For details on the weekly responsibility, please read the [CI Triage Google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oZqEHd7fIxORdH_A1Q96VueaRIfb2vHUk5HuS4Z5nzk/edit).

Developers are assigned a week (Monday to Monday).

If you are on vacation or out of the office during your assigned week, please find someone to swap with. If there is a critical development item due for the week you are assigned, then work with project leaders to swap with another developer.

We welcome any developer that can commit to a week to assign themselves a week.
