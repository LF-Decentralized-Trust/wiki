   5. Suggestions
      
      1. Joining calls
      2. First commit/contribution
      3. "Recognized" level = 10 (say) commits. Can apply for this – commits are public
      4. Currency is important, e.g. 2020, 2021 badges
      5. Should have LF ID and handle
      6. Nominations are important idea here too
      7. Where does badge show up?
         
         1. 3rd party badge provider
         2. LF profile page
         3. LinkedIn integration possible
      8. Automatic recognition helps
         
         1. RocketChat, Commit history
         2. Keep overhead low - ability to scale
         3. Can also self-nominate, e.g. blog writers
      9. Doc badge seems like good idea
   6. Recognitiion not just badges, going forward
7. Local build process
   
   1. [https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs\_guide.html#building-locally](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs_guide.html#building-locally)
   2. Containerized local builds!
      
      1. Much easier - helps with Python pre-reqs etc
   3. Standardized and recommended process
8. Retiring Fabric docs versions
   
   1. 1.1/1.2/1.3 still being used by readers
   2. 1.4.3 EOS in 2021
   3. 2 step approach to encourage
      
      1. A
         
         1. Banner on every page - to remind people not latest content, with link to latest content
         2. Nice RTD mechanism to do this. A few challenges, but now working
         3. See example: [https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.2/](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.2/)
            
            1. Only on landing page – a bit or work to do
      2. B
         
         1. Archive old content and configure re-direct
         2. Deactivate and redirect: [https://github.com/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues/6891](https://github.com/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues/6891)
   4. Will bring up on contributors call
      
      1. Raise awareness of this issue
