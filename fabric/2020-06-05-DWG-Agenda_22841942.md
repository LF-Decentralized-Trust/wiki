Announcements

Agenda:

- Release status: Pam/Joe
  
  - Dashboard: [https://jira.hyperledger.org/secure/Dashboard.jspa?selectPageId=10104](https://jira.hyperledger.org/secure/Dashboard.jspa?selectPageId=10104)
  - [Wasm Smart Contract RFC](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-rfcs/pull/28/files?short_path=e029004#diff-e02900418b11f737baa1b540adecffbd) - a WebAssembly runtime that can be used as a **new Chaincode implementation in Fabric**. Wasm provides a "well defined, tightly specified, isolated" runtime. It is ideally suited to executing code in a well-controlled and safe manner. Originally intended for use within the browser it is perfectly suited to running outside the browser. The requirements of chaincode and smart contracts are ideally suited to the Wasm model. RFC describe proposal to write a Smart Contract in Rust for deployment to the Wasm chaincode runtime using the external cc builder and launcher.
    
  - Proposed Samples update
    
    - **Asset Transfer - simple** to be used by Writing your first application and Writing your first Chaincode (Chaincode for Developers)
