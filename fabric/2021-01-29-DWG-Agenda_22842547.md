## Announcements

Agenda

- Release status: Pam/Joe: Dashboard: [https://jira.hyperledger.org/secure/Dashboard.jspa?selectPageId=10104](https://jira.hyperledger.org/secure/Dashboard.jspa?selectPageId=10104)
  
  - Fabric v2.2.2 release notes: [https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/releases/tag/v2.2.2](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/releases/tag/v2.2.2)
  - Fabric v1.4.10 release notes: [https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/releases/tag/v1.4.10](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/releases/tag/v1.4.10)
  - Fabric CA v1.5 (Feb)
  - Programming Model updates:  
    
    - v2.2.5 of *fabric-sdk-java* is released with updates to gRPC and netty dependency versions to address security vulnerabilities in those packages: [https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-java/releases/tag/v2.2.5](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-java/releases/tag/v2.2.5)
    - Plan is to introduce the Fabric Gateway before Fabric v3.0
    - Is there a plan for who is documenting the Gateway?
  - Tokens: Community ERC-721 sample
  - Tagged versions of the samples are now available in Github
    
    - [https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/tree/v2.2.1](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/tree/v2.2.1)
    - Dave Enyeart: We will eventually create a **v2.3.0** tag, although I was in no hurry to create it since the default behavior when a matching tag doesn't exist is to give you master branch and I'd prefer people have the latest master rather than an older commit. We've only been adding a tag when there becomes an incompatible change in master
- Fabric Documentation Translation Campaign update
- Final bits of System Channel removal doc updates:
  
  - Fabric v2.3 Test Network requires Docker 2.5.0.1, does not work with Docker 3.1.0.
  - Fabric v2.2 Add test network download instructions to create a channel tutorial [https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/pull/2316](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/pull/2316)
  - Add Create a channel tutorial without a system channel and using test network [https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/pull/2313](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/pull/2313)
- 2021 Priorities: Theme: *Make Fabric easier to use and update*
  
  - **High:**
    
    - Finish system channel remove/update Test network &amp; tutorial
    - Getting Started
    - Update Developing Applications/decide what to do with the Commercial Paper Sample (who's decision is this?)
    - Encourage users to migrate off of older releases with deprecation banner on earlier release topics
    - Fabric Documentation Translation Campaign
    - New [Deprecations Strategy and Page](https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-18375) (v3.0?)
  - **Medium**
    
    - ![(plus)](images/icons/emoticons/add.png) New Add/Remove Raft ordering node tutorial
    - Prune [Jira Backlog](https://jira.hyperledger.org/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=119&view=planning&issueLimit=100)
    - ![(minus)](images/icons/emoticons/forbidden.png) Do we still need 2 Introductions? Rewrite. Possibly good candidate for community work
  - **Low**
    
    - Arch Reference topic. Not  really  reference  per se.  Significant effort. Move all of it into Ops guides
      
    - Doc more usage with channel management config library &amp;&amp; Improved tooling for interactive edit and verification of config blocks
    - Node Backup and Restore - depends on how you deployed. Difft strategies . Fabric needs to do more. What are customer reqts across different clouds?
  - **Normal Release function documentation**
    
    - SDK doc updates for Fabric Gateway
    - Gossip re-architecture
      
    - Token toolkit

## Discussion

Minutes:

1. Fabric translation campaign - Campaign asset spreadsheet
   
   1. Target - Video/blog  completion by end of Feb.
   2. Social and Wiki aspects of the campaign.
   3. Really active meetup community - virtual meetups now.
   4. Would this group be interested in doing a meetup? Capture a video that you can use in the future? About the Doc working group in general could help bring more Documentation contributors.
      
      1. Could be a Tutorial or a Technical deep-dive
      2. Tech study circle
      3. Suggestion: tie the meetup from change in doc in tutorials right into the how to...
      4. We should focus on things that drive adoption - how to make a business case... don't have to be technical to participate.
      5. Draft up what we'd like to cover and David can connect us with one of the organizers.
2. Fabric v2.3 Test Network sample incompatibility with latest version of Docker. Need to use Docker v2.5.0.1. Plan to create a PR to add this to Prereqs, Test Network and test network troubleshooting topics
3. Fabric Test Network sample no longer works with Fabric v2.2 Test network tutorial. Need to get PR merged ASAP.
4. Fabric v2.3 Create a channel tutorial plan
   
   1. Remove without a system channel from the title - so there will still be 2 tutorials for the time being to help users learn how to get started with this new feature.
   2. Then, open a Jira to either combine 2 tutorials into one and or create an ops guide topic that includes both the config step requirements + using the orderer management APIs.
5. Priorities
   
   1. Jira Backlog - really need more attention and priortiziation.
