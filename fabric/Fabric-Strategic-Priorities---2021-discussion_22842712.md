# Hyperledger Fabric : Fabric Strategic Priorities - 2021 discussion

Created by David Enyeart, last modified on Nov 15, 2022

Discussion at [September 29, 2021 contributor meeting](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/22842558/20210929_contributors_meeting.mp4?api=v2).

Results from Fabric strategic priorities community survey (in order of survey results):

1. **BFT support in ordering service.** This has been long discussed and there have been investments in SmartBFT ([https://github.com/SmartBFT-Go/consensus/](https://github.com/SmartBFT-Go/consensus/)) and MirBFT ([https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/mirbft](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/mirbft))Â that could be leveraged to bring BFT support to Fabric. SmartBFT has a proposed [RFC](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-rfcs/pull/33) under review.
2. **Pruning old blocks** from peer and orderer to alleviate concerns around long term storage growth - placeholder [issue](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/issues/2797) until an RFC is available.
3. **Performance improvements** - refactor peer validation/commit logic and private data handling to alleviate known performance bottlenecks - [proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BBVA8u-GJ99ZYRT015PAnMVK4_pKv53Y-kiP9lZX8Gc/edit?usp=sharing) needs to be turned into an RFC.
4. **Replace goleveldb** with a more modern key/value embedded database with better performance characteristics.
5. **Fabric Smart Client** - Released as a lab in 2021, this is a new pattern for multi-party applications backed by Fabric that provides flexibility and privacy beyond existing chaincode and private data capabilities. We could further invest in this pattern and work towards full project status - [https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/fabric-smart-client](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/fabric-smart-client)
6. **Queryability (embedded in peer) -** query language support in peer on top of the embedded key/value state store
7. **Queryability (external database)** - queryable external database (CouchDB or otherwise).
8. **Token support (existing execute-order model)** - Fabric token SDK ([https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/fabric-token-sdk](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/fabric-token-sdk)) approach using endorsement model. Token transactions are executed by required endorsers and then submitted to ordering (zero-knowledge transfer is possible).
9. **Token support (new order-execute model)** - Built-in post-order execution of token transactions. Token transactions are executed on every peer after ordering, no need to trust a sub-set of endorsing peers, aka 'FabToken' approach (zero-knowledge transfer is possible).
