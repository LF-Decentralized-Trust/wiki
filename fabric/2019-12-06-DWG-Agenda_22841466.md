## Announcements

This week's agenda:

1. V2.0 release status: Pam/Joe
   
   1. v2.0 Beta progress - target is to cut release on Monday 12/16. (There is no release candidate for a Beta)
   2. CC Launcher
      
      1. details from Matt Sykes [https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/22840713/20191127\_contributors\_meeting.mp4?api=v2](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/22840713/20191127_contributors_meeting.mp4?api=v2)
      2. doc eta: 12/8
   3. Updates around Move to GitHub
2. New Java chaincode tutorial [https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/pull/371](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/pull/371/files?file-filters%5B%5D=.rst) - Matthew White
3. New test network (BYFN replacement) latest updates [https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/pull/80](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/pull/80#pullrequestreview-327038284) : Nik
4. Propose process for merging documentation changes into Github. From the 11/27 Community Contributors call:
   
   1. There was general agreement that documentation should not be split from Fabric repository unless there is a very compelling reason to do so.
   2. The expectation is that all the issues previously identified in this thread could be resolved without splitting out Fabric documentation.
   3. As a next step, the documentation team took an action to propose a workflow such that documentation content (including translated content) in the main Fabric repository could be delivered without the need for new documentation/translation specific project maintainers.
5. Fabric 2.0 Upgrade process docs: [https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/pull/299](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/pull/366) Joe
6. MSP Key Concept updates: [https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/pull/307](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/pull/307) Pam

## Discussion

1. Release status: Pam
   
   1. Date for V2.0 beta is Mon 16th December
   2. Chaincode launcher doc not quite ready yet, PR close
   3. Upgrade docs coming along nicely, under review, not tested yet. Will be merged into main docs when tested.
   4. Will be shipping 2.0 SDKs and smart contract chaincode
   5. Other tools will be updated
2. Java chaincode tutorial: Mathew
   
   01. Javadocs don't currently have tutorials
   02. JSDocs better but would belong better in RTD
   03. Matthew showed Java smart contract quickstart in RTD, using local build
   04. List of tutorials is long - discussion on grouping in TOC
   05. Application, smart contract, ledger and network categories
   06. Jim on standardizing tutorials using tutorial objectives and assumptions per new Java quick start tutorial
       
       1. Will help as Fabric grows, keep users up to date
       2. Helps users assess quickly whether they want to try out tutorial
   07. From teaching perspective, helps learning exercise
   08. Chris observation on Fabric goal to make ubiquitous – use SDKs
       
       1. A little care required with quick start tutorials – leads to "getting started" mentality.
       2. Need also to think about production mentality.
       3. Tutorial ***Assumptions*** wrt skill set is very important for more advanced users
          
          1. There is a need for more production examples/material
   09. Chris on Tutorial structure:
       
       1. Some topics have links into SDK, e.g. Getting Started topic
          
          1. this should have links to e.g. Java SDK
       2. Suggestion to link backward from Java SDK back to RTD
   10. Pam: observation on relationship to BYFN discussion
       
       1. Test network for getting started
       2. Also guide for Day 2 operations
   11. Is it possible to use the same network for different turotials
3. New Test network (BYFN replacement): Nik
   
   01. Clone and test from 2.0 Master - uses the latest code
   02. (See video for demo by Nik)
   03. More modular approach to building a network
   04. Scripts are separated out into separate concerns, e.g. create peer, create channel, join channel etc...e
   05. Deploy smart contract from commands
   06. Uses new lifecycle in V2.0
   07. Intention is build a test network, rather than a production network
   08. Would it be useful to run create channel command to print commands to console?
       
       1. generate bare bones of command sequence
   09. Two PRs for this work
       
       1. FAB-17145 Test network to Samples
       2. FAB-17199 Add new test network tutorial
   10. BYFN name changed to "Test network"
       
       1. Emphasis on trying it again as it's improved so much
       2. Current example doesn't help with certification
       3. New test network makes it much simpler
       4. Chris emphasis on taking exam for 2.0 - this is a key example
   11. Co-exist with BYFN for a little while, then remove old BYFN in time
   12. Uses new package format, leveraging new doc material
   13. Discussion on certification exam: RTD is the only website allowed
   14. Deprecation of docs discussed
   15. Align with Linux Foundation certification
4. New process for merging documentation changes into Github: Pam
   
   1. Change how docs gets merged into RTD
   2. (See video  for full walkthrough)
   3. Goals outlined
      
      1. Encourage contribution
      2. Easier to make small changes
      3. Simplicity
      4. Additional languages
   4. Fabric docs stay in existing repo
   5. Maintainers are augmented by doc reviewers and doc approvers
   6. PRs for doc-only updates can be merged by Doc approvers
   7. Only requires +1 by non-doc approver
   8. Need multiple Doc approvers
5. **Deferred:** Fabric 2.0 Upgrade process docs: [https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/pull/299](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/pull/366) Joe
6. **Deferred:** MSP Key Concept updates: [https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/pull/307](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/pull/307) Pam
