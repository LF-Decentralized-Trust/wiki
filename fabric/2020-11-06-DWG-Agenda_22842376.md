## Discussion

Minutes:

1. LF Documentation translation campaign
   
   1. How to surface and recognize the work of these active translation groups to tell their story
   2. Needed some help with video editing
   3. early next year
2. Orderer deployment guide - does not include the channel participation api flow... (get this merged first/then new pr that talks about the participation api)
   
   1. PR: [https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/pull/2080](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/pull/2080)
   2. follows same pattern as previous deployment topics
   3. planning - decisions you have to make before you start
   4. checklist - similarities to peer, but with additional things
   5. 
      
      [https://hyperledger-fabric–2080.org.readthedocs.build/en/2080/deployment\_guide\_overview.html](https://hyperledger-fabric--2080.org.readthedocs.build/en/2080/deployment_guide_overview.html)

3. Jim: Each RFC creates more tech debt for us as we need to go back and update these existing topics..
4. Pam showed the latest updates to the Channel Participation API documentation.
5. Jim - Built in MSP &amp; CA system - people need to use these for Prod env. Have we defined an RFC for integration for self-soverign identity systems?
   
   1. If the identity system that we have to authenticate  -
   2. Federated identity to authenticate to an existing network similar to Fabric - open id interface for authentication
      
      1. without using the Fabric CA - bringing own identity
