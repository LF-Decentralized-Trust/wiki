# Why elect me? 为什么选我？

I nominate myself, as I believe that it is good for our community:

- have voices from different people. For this one, I can provide voice from technological point of view.
- practice makes true knowledge. For this one, as maintainer for major projects, I am good at practice and 1st line contribution.
- communication and sharing, I am grade to sharing knowledges with others.
  
  - For ex, my sharing at bilibili [https://space.bilibili.com/276546?spm\_id\_from=333.33.b\_73656375726974794f75744c696e6b.1](https://space.bilibili.com/276546?spm_id_from=333.33.b_73656375726974794f75744c696e6b.1) and my csdn blog [https://blog.csdn.net/oe1019](https://blog.csdn.net/oe1019)

In 2022,

1st, I hope we can continue our works in 2021, as GM group for 国密支持, and as performance got 4th rank with Fabric strategic survey result:

I hope we can continue with those two sub group works.

2nd, I hope we can work close with others expose us to public by meet up/workshop and others.

There are lots for good projects in fabric labs and I hope we can have meet ups to share those projects to public.
