Now we are working on a program on food traceability with Bei Da Huang Group, which is one of the biggest grain production bases in China, to make the premium rice traceable to the customers. We apply blockchain technology to the whole processes all through the rice’s planting, harvest, processing, storage, transportation, selling and purchasing etc. Every single data will be captured and recorded onto the ledger of blockchain, the smart contract will ensure all the data connected in a certain logic and finally generate an unique ID for the rice. When the customers finish purchasing a bag of rice, he can check if the related information of rice can be visible on the blockchain using the unique ID. The true Rice ID will provide the customers for very specific information including the rice’s variety, the planting farmers’ profile, the production process on the farm, the data in every key growing stage, harvest and verification data, processing, logistics etc. With these information, customers can be convinced the premium rice he purchase is real.

NTT DATA, a global IT service provider, recently announced (Jun. 7, 2017) that it has successfully tested Japan’s first prototype of a smart insurance policy based on blockchain, proving that blockchain offers attractive security and cost advantages for shippers and insurance companies. The smart insurance policy prototype is the latest step taken by NTT DATA under a vision to innovate a new international trading system with blockchain, a distributed ledger that creates an unchangeable record of transactions.

NTT DATA is implementing a strategic plan to develop FinTech technology based on blockchain’s decentralized ledger model, leveraging its R&amp;D centers in Japan, the USA (Palo Alto) and Italy (Cosenza) as well as its parent NTT Group’s overall 2 billion USD investment in R&amp;D. In the field of international trade, NTT DATA envisions adopting blockchain technology to enable transactional parties, including shippers (exporters), consignees (importers), banks, insurance companies, and carriers/forwarders, to share information simultaneously. The expected benefits include a significant reduction of transactional processing time, maintenance of transactional information integrity and reduction/elimination of document delivery costs.

Last year, NTT DATA began taking full-fledged steps with stakeholders to verify its concept of innovating a new international trading system. The first prototype of a smart letter of credit was tested to verify the practicality of exporters, purchasing banks, issuing banks and importers using blockchain. The second (current) prototype was developed collaboratively by Tokio Marine &amp; Nichido Fire Insurance and NTT DATA and then tested from December 2016 to March 2017. The test proved that blockchain offers attractive security and cost advantages for shippers and insurance companies. Compared to conventional web-based systems for issuing insurance, the test showed that a system based on smart insurance could reduce the shipper’s data-input workload by about 85% and the insurer’s workload by about 83%.

The test also included making an intentionally malicious revision to the nodes to see how the blockchain would react. The result was successful - when one block was revised in the mock attack, the attacked block was not distributed to other nodes due to its data inconsistency, but the rest of the blockchain system continued to function normally, proving that only legitimate transactions are permitted.

NTT DATA ultimately hopes to apply blockchain technology throughout the entire international trading system. As the next step in its vision, NTT DATA plans to test a new prototype that will include carriers/forwarders by the end of 2017.
