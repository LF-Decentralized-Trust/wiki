# Technical Working Group China : Jiannan (Jay) Guo

Created by J Guo on Sep 26, 2020

# Self-introduction

Jiannan Guo is tech lead of RootCloud Blockchain team, and previous IBM open source developer. He has been been the chair of TWGC and Hyperledger Fabric committer since 2018, and actively contributing to Hyperledger for several years, including code, content and talks.

He has been always enthusiastic about Open Source and believed in software development driven by collaborative community. He's been active in several open source project other than Fabric, including Apache Mesos, Cloud Foundry etc.

# Why elect me?

I have been leading TWGC for some time and fairly familiar with administrative process and management. Furthermore, as Fabric committer, I've been trying to bridge local developers in China with global community, in terms of code contribution, doc i18n and user experience.

I am willing to dedicate my time and effort to continue serving the community, and more importantly, bringing local users and developers into the more broad Hyperledger gloabl community.
