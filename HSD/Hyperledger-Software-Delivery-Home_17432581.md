Welcome to your new space!

The Confluence space was set up to allow you to choose between three different formats:

1. Project Space
2. Working Group Space
3. Special Interest Group Space

Each of these types is captured in a separate section below. To set up this space, remove the sections related to the other two types of spaces.

## Complete these tasks to get started

- Edit this home page - Click Edit in the top right of this screen. Remove two of the three sections below, as well as this section when you are happy with the layout of the page.
- Configure the sidebar - remove the "Pages", "Blog", and "Space Shortcuts" sections by clicking on the \`-\` sign next to them until they appear as a \`+\` sign. Then save the changes.
- Create a Meeting Agendas and Notes page - Click the Create button in the header to get started
- Brand your Space - Click Configure Sidebar in the left panel to update space details and logo
- Set permissions - Click Space Tools in the left sidebar to update permissions and give others access (usually the only change here is to click the View option for Anonymous users)
- Label the page appropriately - For a project space, label this page `project-home`. For a workgroup space, label this `wg-home`. For a SIG space, label this `SIG-home`.
- Update links for mailing list
- Update links for chat channel
