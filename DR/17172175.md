#### Code &amp; Projects

CC-Tools Lab

If you're interested in tooling that can help you more easily create chaincode for Hyperledger Fabric, [check out the recording of a meetup about the CC-Tools lab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Giibwnt4fA).  This lab is creating an easy to use framework to develop Hyperledger Fabric chaincodes in Golang that provides a relational-like definitions of asset types, datatype validation, also allowing the creation of custom types, Fabric events management and easy transaction definition, with built-in arguments validation and callers restriction.  [Check out the CC-Tools Github repo for more information](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/cc-tools).

#### Noteworthy Pull Requests

#### Articles, Training &amp; Tutorials

Learn what developers in the real world are doing with Hyperledger technologies in our Developer Showcase blog series.  [The latest showcase post features Fernando Paris, Co-CEO and CTO of ioBuilders](https://www.hyperledger.org/blog/developer-showcase-series-fernando-paris-co-ceo-and-cto-iobuilders).  Fernando has been involved with Hyperledger Besu from its early alpha stages, contributing by testing its features, integrating new functionalities, and supporting the community.  If you're actively involved in the Hyperledger community and would like to highlight yourself, or another developer you work with, [let us know](mailto:community-architects@hyperledger.org).
