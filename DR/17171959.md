#### Announcements

The new [Hyperledger Collaborative Learning Program](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/CLP/Collaborative+Learning+Program) is a pilot program to connect those interested in mentoring with those seeking guided open source contribution experience. The program offers mentoring resources to expand the number of new contributors receiving guidance on learning about Hyperledger projects and becoming a productive active contributor to the Hyperledger community.  [Learn more about the program and check out the projects you can apply for](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/CLP/Collaborative+Learning+Program).  Applications open on June 5 and will close on June 25.
