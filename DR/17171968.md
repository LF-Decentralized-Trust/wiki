#### Announcements

#### Code &amp; Projects

Hyperledger Bevel and Hyperledger Fabric

- On Tuesday, June 20 at 8AM pacific join us for an [in-depth technical workshop and demonstration of using Bevel and the new Bevel-Operator-Fabric](https://zoom.us/meeting/register/tJcrdOqrqD8uGtdHQSapt-cS55XzWJC_TnXs) to deploy Hyperledger Fabric on Kubernetes.  The Hyperledger Bevel developers have [recently integrated hlf-operator, a Hyperledger lab, into Hyperledger Bevel](https://www.hyperledger.org/blog/2023/04/27/introducing-kubernetes-operators-in-hyperledger-bevel-with-bevel-operator-fabric) and have renamed it to Bevel-Operator-Fabric.  Adding Bevel-Operator-Fabric is an important milestone for Hyperledger Bevel and a step towards the redesign of Bevel with support for Kubernetes operators to achieve DLT (distributed ledger technology) network deployments and automation.  [Sign up for the workshop](https://zoom.us/meeting/register/tJcrdOqrqD8uGtdHQSapt-cS55XzWJC_TnXs).
