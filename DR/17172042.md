#### Announcements

We have just announced a new [virtual workshop about How to Create a Currency Management Application and Deploy it on a Hyperledger Fabric Network](https://zoom.us/meeting/register/tJAucu6tpjstGdWBjYkepXixkFEBP4637-sk).  This will take place on Thursday, October 12 at 9 AM Pacific and will focus on two essential aspects of the Fabric Token-SDK. Firstly, you'll learn how to develop a straightforward token application to manage a currency. You'll grasp the fundamentals of creating tokens, and implementing transaction logic using the Fabric Token-SDK. Once you've mastered the application development, we'll then show you how to effortlessly deploy it in your existing Fabric network, ensuring a seamless integration with your blockchain infrastructure.  [Register for the workshop](https://zoom.us/meeting/register/tJAucu6tpjstGdWBjYkepXixkFEBP4637-sk) and to learn more about this topic check out a [workshop we did earlier this year on Central Bank Digital Currencies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFSV47Rr2M).

#### Code &amp; Projects

Hyperledger Fabric

If you're interested in seeing how Hyperledger Fabric is being used in the global shipping and trade industry, take a look at our newly published [case study about TradeWaltz and NTT Data Deliver All-in-One Platform for Global Trade Market Built on Hyperledger Fabric](https://www.hyperledger.org/case-studies/how-tradewaltz-is-using-hyperledger-fabric-to-create-the-future-of-global-trade).  TradeWaltz created a cross-industry, all-in-one platform for the global trade market that has three layers: a user interface, the application layer, and the blockchain layer. Read the case study to learn more about what they built and benefits they got from this system.
