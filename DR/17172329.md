#### Announcements

LF Decentralized Trust has launched.  [Check out the new website to learn all about the community and the new projects that have recently joined](http://www.lfdecentralizedtrust.org).  We'll be sharing more about Hiero, Lockness and Trust Over IP over the next several weeks for those who are interested in learning more about how to get involved.  And note that we're in the process of moving the Hyperledger community tools over to the LF Decentralized Trust community so be aware that you'll be seeing changes coming to our tools such as mailing lists, wikis and more.

#### Code &amp; Projects

For anyone who is a maintainer of a project or lab, you are invited to the Maintainer Days event in San Francisco on Oct 21 and 22. This is the first in person maintainer event we've hosted since before the pandemic in 2019.  [Check out what is being planned for those two days and learn more about how to register](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/events/Maintainer+Days+October+21-22%2C+2024).  There are several open slots in the agenda where you can sign up to present about your project and where you can add topics you'd like to discuss, so feel free to edit the wiki page or leave comments.

#### Noteworthy Pull Requests

#### Articles, Training &amp; Tutorials

#### Events

There are a couple of online presentations happening this week that you may be interested in attending:

- Thursday, September 19 at 16:00 UTC / 9:00 PDT: [Hyperledger San Francisco hosts "Splice: A Lab to Extend Canton Network Interoperability &amp; Harness Tokenomics"](https://www.meetup.com/hyperledger-sf/events/302831418/)

These are scheduled at the same time so if you're interested in both, you can attend one and then catch the recording of the other on the [LFDT YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/Hyperledger).

You can find more Hyperledger calls and other events [listed on the community calendar](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/HYP/Calendar+of+Public+Meetings).
