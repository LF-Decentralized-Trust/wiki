#### Announcements

We'd like to share about the launch of the new [Hyperledger Besu Financial Services Working Group](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/BFFWG/), an industry-wide collaboration where enterprise users and code contributors to Hyperledger Besu can actively define new features and enhancements that strengthen the alignment between organizations adopting the technology and the development process.In addition to DTCC, which is chairing the group, founding members include Accenture, Banco Central do Brasil, Consensys, Citi, Japan Securities Clearing Corporation (JSCC), Kaleido, LACNET, Mastercard, Santander, Visa, Web3 Labs, and others. This is an open group that everyone who is interested in the topic is welcome to join. [Sign up to the group's mailing list to take part in discussions and to get notifications of group calls](https://lists.hyperledger.org/g/besu-fs-wg).

#### Code &amp; Projects

Hyperledger Burrow

Hyperledger Burrow was a unique project under the Hyperledger community, offering a framework for executing smart contracts in permissioned blockchains. Despite its innovative features, it was sunsetted in May 2022. [The latest Blockchain Pioneers blog post examines what Burrow was, why it didn't get more adoption and how it set the stage for other Hyperledger projects](https://www.hyperledger.org/blog/blockchain-pioneers-hyperledger-burrow) that came later that focused on the Ethereum ecosystem, such as Hyperledger Besu and Hyperledger Web3j. We would like to thank all of the people who contributed to Hyperledger Burrow while it was an active project. 

Hyperledger Solang

The Hyperledger Solang maintainers wanted to share that [Solang, a new Solidity compiler written in Rust, is compatible with Aleph Zero](https://twitter.com/aleph__zero/status/1770821764907475032), a blockchain built with the polkadot-sdk that has fast blocktimes (1s) and ZK features. Check out the [Solang Github repo](https://github.com/hyperledger/solang) to learn more about how to install and get started with Solang.

#### Noteworthy Pull Requests

#### Articles, Training &amp; Tutorials

The Linux Foundation is creating a [Hyperledger Besu Certified Professional certification](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/certification/hyperledger-besu-certified-professional/?__hstc=18976039.085e2c528b47234dad29e5e0a9d9d6db.1610074697314.1711574172763.1711646027033.1673&__hssc=18976039.2.1711646027033&__hsfp=3231766362) and we need your help.  For anyone with Besu experience we want your feedback about what topics and competencies should be included in an exam that someone would need to pass to earn the certification.  [Please take a few minutes to fill out a survey to share your feedback on the Besu certification exam](https://www.certiverse.com/#/register/organization/9de30b15-89f9-4344-84bf-d67851bd3e2e/jta/c6842c26-3d55-49f5-8f37-6af5e9426e60/survey/c7ef5a36-9f27-488a-8bb1-a861a0f0190a).
