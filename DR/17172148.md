#### Announcements

This will be the last issue of the /dev/weekly newsletter for 2023.  We hope everyone has a happy holidays and we will see you again in early January 2024.

#### Code &amp; Projects

In the last Technical Oversight Committee meeting of the year, the TOC Chair went through a [summary of everything that the group has accomplished this year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulrxTp2LHmo).  It is a nice recap of all of the effort that has been going into supporting the community and helping create a healthy ecosystem around all of Hyperledger's projects and labs.  The summary starts about 36 minutes into [the recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulrxTp2LHmo).

#### Noteworthy Pull Requests

#### Articles, Training &amp; Tutorials

If you're looking for information about one of Hyperledger's projects or labs, check out the [playlist of Meetups](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0MZ85B_96CEmmy0C6NF52ZCMNcY1Wryf) and the [playlist of Workshops](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0MZ85B_96CEe44MIz7C89OXGkrm4zPok) on the Hyperledger YouTube channel.  Throughout 2023 community members from most projects and many labs have talked about the work they've been doing in these events and they've shown how to use their projects and how to start contributing.
