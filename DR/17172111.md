#### Announcements

If you'd like an update on everything happening in the Hyperledger community, [check out a recording on Daniela Barbosa, Hyperledger's Executive Director at Sibos 2023 in September](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ae707OrPs6E). Daniela takes a deep dive into the heart of Hyperledger Foundation's mission and explores its collaboration with leading Hyperledger members, focusing on tokenization, programmable money, CBDCs, decentralized identity, digital wallets, and more.  Thanks to IntellectEU for hosting the talk and posting the recording.
