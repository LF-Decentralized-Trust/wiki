Hyperledger Web3j

[Web3j](https://github.com/hyperledger/web3j), a lightweight library for working with Smart Contracts on the Ethereum network, has released a new version that includes bug fixes, updated TypeReference and TypeDecoder to support decoding of dynamic structs and dynamic struct arrays without a priori Class definitions and more. [Check out the Web3j repo for more about the release](https://github.com/hyperledger/web3j).  And if you'd like to see where the project is headed, the [maintainers have recently published a project roadmap for 2024 and 2025](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/WEB3J/Roadmap+2024+-+2025).

After a short summer break, we're starting up our virtual meetups again.  Check out these two meetups happening the week of August 26.

[Wednesday, August 28 at 7 PM Eastern: Exploring the AI FAQ Chat Bot](https://www.meetup.com/hyperledger-princeton/events/302518868/).  This is an AI-powered chat bot being worked on by Hyperledger community members and you'll get a chance to see a demo and try it out yourself. This is a fantastic opportunity to learn, interact, and contribute to an open-source project that’s pushing the boundaries of AI and blockchain integration.

[Thursday, August 29 at 9 AM Pacific: Tokenized zero knowledge machine learning and its applications](https://www.meetup.com/hyperledger-budapest/events/301992196/).  During this meetup we will investigate how services of a zkML (zero knowledge machine learning) can be represented as blockchain tokens, similarly to the ERC7007 token standard. We will also try to create a demonstration for a simple zkML NFT token in Solidity (Hyperledger Besu compatible) or in Hyperledger Fabric.

There are also [several meetups already scheduled for September to check out](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/events/Virtual+Hyperledger+Meetups) as well.

You can find more Hyperledger calls and other events [listed on the community calendar](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/HYP/Calendar+of+Public+Meetings).

This newsletter is sent out to hundreds of Hyperledger developers. It is a collaborative effort. If you have a project release, pull request, community event, and/or relevant article you would like highlighted next week, please leave a comment for consideration.
