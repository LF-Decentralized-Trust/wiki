#### Announcements

Hyperledger TSC Election

- The Hyperledger Technical Steering Committee (TSC) election has begun. You should all have received at least one email from “Dave Huseby (CIVS poll supervisor) &lt;[civs@cs.cornell.edu](mailto:civs@cs.cornell.edu)&gt;” with a link to the web-based ballot. The election concludes on October 10th, 2020. If you have not received your ballot email, or can only find the original email from Saturday, please first check your email spam folder/filter. If it is not in there, then please email [election@lists.hyperledger.org](mailto:election@lists.hyperledger.org) so that we can make sure you receive a ballot.

#### Code &amp; Projects

Hyperledger Fabric 

- Hyperledger [Fabric v1.4.9](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/releases/tag/v1.4.9) and [v2.2.1](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/releases/tag/v2.2.1) are now available. Hyperledger [Fabric CA v1.4.9](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-ca/releases/tag/v1.4.9) is also available.
  
  - These releases represent the current long-term support (LTS) releases for Hyperledger Fabric. As a reminder, important fixes are applied to master, as well as the v1.4.x and v2.2.x LTS releases. There are some important improvements and fixes included, especially in the areas of certificate expirations/renewals and PKCS#11 HSM performance.

#### Articles, Training &amp; Tutorials

- [Protocols, Not Platforms: A Technological Approach to Free Speech](https://knightcolumbia.org/content/protocols-not-platforms-a-technological-approach-to-free-speech) by Mike Masnick
- Hyperledger Sawtooth for Application Developers - Learn how to code a Hyperledger Sawtooth sample application.
  
  - The *Hyperledger Sawtooth for Application Developers* course starts with the basics of blockchain technology and the concepts of permissioned networks, then describes the important features of Hyperledger Sawtooth. It includes a sample distributed application, Sawtooth Simple Supply, that is based on a simplified supply chain example. This blockchain application includes a web-app frontend, a transaction processor (the equivalent of a smart contract) for the blockchain business logic, and a custom REST API for communication. Learning how to code this sample application will teach you about important Hyperledger Sawtooth concepts and will help you understand how to create your own enterprise-level Hyperledger Sawtooth application. Enroll [here](https://www.edx.org/course/hyperledger-sawtooth-for-application-developers-2).
