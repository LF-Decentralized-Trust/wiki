#### Announcements

#### Code &amp; Projects

Adoption of Hyperledger Aries, a toolkit for decentralized identity solutions and digital trust, is climbing and the code is getting more mature. [The Aries Working Group recently published an overview recapping the project's achievements in 2023 and offering a roadmap for the project in 2024](https://www.hyperledger.org/blog/hyperledger-aries-an-epicenter-for-decentralized-digital-identity-collaboration-and-innovation). If you'd like to get a better understanding of what is happening with decentralized identity and what the community is working on this year, check out the post.

#### Noteworthy Pull Requests

#### Articles, Training &amp; Tutorials

On Wednesday, April 24 at 8 AM Pacific join us for the [Zero Knowledge Proofs and ZK Programming in Blockchain Application Development workshop](https://zoom.us/meeting/register/tJYkfuyhpjsqGd1FCs-ZeFzD90EyqFy18IMt). In this workshop we will give a high-level introduction to the zero knowledge and SNARK technology stack and will show experimental integrations with Hyperledger Fabric and with Solidity as well, being compatible with Hyperledger Besu.  [Register to attend the workshop](https://zoom.us/meeting/register/tJYkfuyhpjsqGd1FCs-ZeFzD90EyqFy18IMt).
