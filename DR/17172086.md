[Enroll today](https://www.hyperledger.org/learn/training#certifications).

#### Code &amp; Projects

Hyperledger AnonCreds

Mike Lodder joined the AnonCreds call on Monday, September 25 to discuss the newly accepted [Hyperledger Labs projec](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/hyperledger-labs.github.io/pull/249)[t](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/hyperledger-labs.github.io/pull/249) [Agora](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/hyperledger-labs.github.io/pull/249), a set of repositories that implement the AnonCreds v2.0 specification that we have been discussing, and more.  [Check out the recording to learn more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDmckWnVsL4).

Mike has been working on this implementation for the past several years and we're excited to have the code made open source and available to use and expand upon. The implementation enables the new features that have been envisioned for AnonCreds v2.0, an evolution of the existing AnonCreds specification/implementation that provides:

1. Flexibility in the underlying signatures, including support for BBS+, PS and CL Signatures.
2. Expanded Issuer/Holder access to ZKP capabilities, such as set membership, range proofs, verifiable encryption and more.
3. The familiar participants, interactions, and objects of AnonCreds v1.0, enabling a clear and provend path to adoption

The project also includes a number of other generally useful cryptographic libraries that will be helpful for developers. An example is a key ring library for protecting secrets in memory from side channel attacks like Row hammer and ram bleed. Lots of fun/powerful tools for this space.

Hyperledger Solang

Cyrill Leutwiler, from Parity Technologies recently presented at a [workshop for anyone who needs to learn anything about how to build and run Solidity contracts on parachains with the contracts pallet via Hyperledger Solang](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jiY7ENvrPM). He explores how the Polkadot ecsosytem can most benefit from what Solidity has to offer. Also suitable for less technical folk.

#### Noteworthy Pull Requests

#### Articles, Training &amp; Tutorials

Join Hyperledger &amp; IBM on Thursday, October 12 at 9 AM pacific for the workshop: [How to Create a Currency Management Application &amp; Deploy it on a Hyperledger Fabric Network](https://zoom.us/meeting/register/tJAucu6tpjstGdWBjYkepXixkFEBP4637-sk#/registration).
