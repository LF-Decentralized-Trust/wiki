#### Announcements

The Hyperledger Technical Oversight Committee recently approved [Hyperledger FireFly](https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/firefly) as the latest of Hyperledger Foundation’s projects to achieve graduated status.  This status is granted based on strict criteria like code quality, security protocols, open-source governance, and contributor diversity. Achieving this milestone indicates FireFly's advancement in both its community and codebase, marking significant progress for future blockchain development and broader Web3 adoption. The FireFly community is one of the fastest growing projects in the Web3 space, approaching a million lines of code over the last two and a half years.  [Read more about the key components of FireFly and learn about how it is being used in production](https://www.hyperledger.org/blog/hyperledger-firefly-achieves-graduated-status-is-in-production-around-the-world).

#### Code &amp; Projects

Hyperledger Fabric

In case you missed it, check out the [recording of a meetup where Yacov Manevich from IBM Research talks about the work that he and others have done to bring Byzantine Fault Tolerance to Hyperledger Fabric](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSJjI7AgFPA).  BFT is essential for true decentralization and fault tolerance and in this recording you'll siscover not only why BFT consensus is needed for decentralized ledgers but also how it operates.

Blockchain Explorer Lab

Blockchain Explorer is a powerful tool that acts as a window into the intricate workings of Hyperledger Fabric, simplifying the complex world of blockchain for enterprises and developers.  [The lab recently released version 2.0.0 and the developers have documented what is in the release](https://www.hyperledger.org/blog/introducing-blockchain-explorer-v2.0.0-a-hyperledger-lab), including monitoring the health status of orderers &amp; peers, enhanced searching capability, chaincode metadata display and more.

#### Noteworthy Pull Requests

#### Articles, Training &amp; Tutorials

The new Hyperledger Fabric Certified Practitioner exam is now available.   If you're interested in demonstrating your expertise with Fabric and want to take the exam, we have a special 25% discount available for members of our Discord community.  If you're interested for the discount, details are in the [#fabric channel on our Discord server](https://discord.com/channels/905194001349627914/905205541326975046).  Offer ends Oct 15.  [Find out more about the exam and sign up](https://www.hyperledger.org/learn/training).

#### Events

We'd like to let you know about the launch of Alex Tapscott's new book [Web3: Charting the Internet's Next Economic and Cultural Frontier](https://www.amazon.com/Web3-Charting-Internets-Economic-Cultural/dp/006329995X/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1678713758&sr=8-1) that came out on September 19th.  This new book will help change the conversation about Web3 just like Tapscott's last book Blockchain Revolution (written with Don Tapscott) changed the discussion from Bitcoin to blockchain for enterprise leaders. Alex is on a [book tour that is coming to New York City, Boston, Chicago and several other cities](https://www.web3booktour.com/) in Canada and the United States.  We thought members of the Hyperledger community may be interested in checking out the book and attending one of the book tour events near you.

Hyperledger Identity SIG

On 10/5 the Identity SIG welcomed Karla McKenna and Lance Byrd from GLEIF to discuss Organizational Identity:  Interoperability vLEI and Hyperledger. You can find the wiki page with video of their session here: [2023-10-05: Identity Special Interest Group](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IWG/pages/18252180/2023-10-05+Identity+Special+Interest+Group)

Thurs 10/19 Darrel O'Donnell joins the ID SIG to discuss the state of identity wallets. 

You can find more Hyperledger calls and other events [listed on the community calendar](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/HYP/Calendar+of+Public+Meetings).

This newsletter is sent out to hundreds of Hyperledger developers. It is a collaborative effort. If you have a project release, pull request, community event, and/or relevant article you would like highlighted next week, please leave a comment for consideration.
