#### Announcements

#### Code &amp; Projects

Hyperledger Web3j

The project maintainers have announced that all Web3j repositories have been upgraded to the latest Gradle version 8.7. In addition, we have updated the dependency libraries to their latest versions to address vulnerabilities and deprecated code. [Check out their blog post for more details about the changes to Web3j](https://blog.web3labs.com/web3development/web3j-gradle-8.7-upgrade-and-vulnerability-fixes).

Perun Lab

The Perun lab aims to enable machine to machine payments on any blockchain supported by Perun. Essentially, light-weight embedded devices will be able to operate state-channels. With its unique features and capabilities, the Perun framework paves the way for a new era of scalable and efficient machine-based transactions. [Read more in this blog post that talks about how Perun enables economic transactions between embedded IoT devices](https://www.hyperledger.org/blog/perun-a-hyperledger-lab-enables-economic-transactions-between-embedded-iot-devices).

#### Noteworthy Pull Requests

#### Articles, Training &amp; Tutorials

In case you missed it, [check out the recording of the recent technical workshop on DLT Interoperation: Implementing IETF Secure Asset Transfer Protocol in Hyperledger Cacti](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmkK2lxhhFw&t=1s). Maintainers of the Cacti project provide a comprehensive understanding of the concepts, architecture, and practical implementation aspects involved in standardizing the transfer of digital assets between diverse blockchain networks.
