#### Announcements

We've just announced a new workshop about [Moving Central Bank Digital Currency from Conception to Reality with Hyperledger Technologies](https://zoom.us/meeting/register/tJIuc-yorzgtH9ALXmvq-fNix40H8UmqPJpX) on Tuesday, April 25, 2023 from 7 AM to 10 AM Pacific / 4 PM to 7 PM CEST.  This will provide an overview of CBDC use-cases and how enterprise Blockchain technologies address many of these requirements. In particular this will show how CBDC systems can move from conception to reality with deep-dives and hands-on sessions.  [Register now if you're interested because space is limited](https://zoom.us/meeting/register/tJIuc-yorzgtH9ALXmvq-fNix40H8UmqPJpX).
