#### Announcements

Governance is a cornerstone for open source community management and, ultimately, code. For Hyperledger Foundation, technical governance is the job of the Technical Oversight Committee (TOC), which consists of 11 members of the technical contributor community elected annually by maintainers and Governing Board members. The 2024 TOC have, once again, chosen Accenture’s Tracy Kuhrt as chair and Arun SM as vice chair. [Check out this recent blog post where Tracy and Arun share their take on why they think it’s important to be technical leaders in this community as well where they see opportunities and challenges for the year ahead](https://www.hyperledger.org/blog/governance-update-a-qa-with-the-leaders-of-the-2024-hyperledger-foundation-technical-oversight-committee).

#### Code &amp; Projects

Hyperledger Web3j

Learn about the newest Hyperledger project, Hyperledger We3bj, the widely used Ethereum integration library.  Web3j is a highly modular Java and Android library that allows you to work with the Ethereum blockchain, without the additional overhead of having to write your own integration code for the platform.  [Join a virtual meetup on Thursday, February 29 at 9:00 Pacific to learn about the new project](https://www.meetup.com/hyperledger-sf/events/299083105/). 

#### Noteworthy Pull Requests

The [Open Enterprise Agent lab](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/open-enterprise-agent), a standards-based cloud agent that provides self-sovereign identity services, has had a number of additional items added recently:

1. Added JWT auth support for agent-admin role
2. Upgraded ZIO http client to improve performance
3. Improved documentation of the OpenAPI specification
4. Added configuration for gRPC usePlainText (enable TLS for gRPC)
5. Added integration with AnonCreds
6. Added consumer restriction parametarization
