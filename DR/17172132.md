Hyperledger Labs

We've created a [new playlist on the Hyperledger YouTube channel that has presentations about various Hyperledger Labs](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0MZ85B_96CGkp9Vxkplkar6GUm9PVQct).  These videos cover a wide range of different innovative development efforts that are going on in the community and these includes Labs that support existing Hyperledger projects as well as stand-alone efforts you may find useful.  Many of the Hyperledger projects started off as a Lab, so checking out what is happening with current Labs could give you a preview of future Hyperledger projects.
