For anyone going to Open Source Summit North America in Seattle, [join us for a 3.5-hour symposium hosted by the Hyperledger Foundation on Monday, April 15, 2024 from 1:30 to 5 PM](https://www.meetup.com/hyperledger-seattle-chapter/events/299516315/). The event will focus on the pivotal themes of decentralization, identity and multi-party systems and featuring leading experts and practitioners in blockchain and distributed ledger technology. This is a unique opportunity to delve into how Hyperledger technologies are driving innovation and solving real-world problems across various sectors.

This event is part of [Open Source Summit North America](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/open-source-summit-north-america/register/) being held at the Seattle Convention Center from April 16-18. If you're planning to go to OSSNA, add this Hyperledger event to your registration. If you haven't signed up for OSSNA yet, [get 20% off registration with this discount code: OSSNA24MINI20](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/open-source-summit-north-america/register/). There are also reduced ticket prices available for Academics, Government employees and Hobbyists.

The Web3j team will lead Ethereum Development with Web3j and Java: A Hands-on Workshop on Thursday, March 28th at 8amPT/11amET/4pm GMT. Hyperledger Web3j is a highly modular, reactive, type safe Java and Android library for working with Smart Contracts and integrating with clients (nodes) on the Ethereum network. This allows you to work with the Ethereum blockchain, without the additional overhead of having to write your own integration code for the platform.  
To Register: [https://zoom.us/meeting/register/tJArdu6trjkoE9Lvnr4\_4L-0GJgIF2VGdKMT](https://zoom.us/meeting/register/tJArdu6trjkoE9Lvnr4_4L-0GJgIF2VGdKMT)

The Hyperledger Foundation will host the workshop, [Zero Knowledge Proofs and ZK Programming in Blockchain Application Development](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/events/pages/21794262/Zero+Knowledge+Proofs+and+ZK+Programming+in+Blockchain+Application+Development.) on Wednesday, April 24th at 8amPT / 11am ET / 4pm GMT. Zero knowledge proofs and SNARK systems are becoming one of the revolutionary technologies of the beginning of this century. In this workshop we will give a high-level introduction to the zero knowledge and SNARK technology stack rather from a software developer and IT professional perspectives with covering only slightly the deep mathematical basis. During the workshop we will implement an experimental zKRollup system in Circom on Hyperledger Besu or Fabric.
