#### Announcements

#### Code &amp; Projects

To stay up to date on the latest developments happening with all of the Hyperledger projects, take a look at the [quarterly reports that project maintainers create](https://toc.hyperledger.org/project-reports/2023/) with updates on what they've been working on and what they're planning in upcoming releases.  Recent reports have come in from Besu, Indy, Fabric and other projects.  If you have any questions about what is included in the reports, you're welcome to connect directly with maintainers on [Hyperledger's Discord server](https://chat.hyperledger.org/) or in the [open community calls](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/HYP/Calendar+of+Public+Meetings).

#### Noteworthy Pull Requests

#### Articles, Training &amp; Tutorials

The new [Hyperledger Fabric Certified Practitioner (HFCP) exam](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/certification/hyperledger-fabric-certified-practitioner-hfcp/) will allow candidates to demonstrate their understanding of the fundamentals of blockchain technology, the Hyperledger Fabric model and networks, including designing production deployments. If you’d like to be notified as soon as the exam is available, you can sign up on the [Hyperledger Fabric Certified Practitioner (HFCP) exam](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/certification/hyperledger-fabric-certified-practitioner-hfcp/) page.  This is a new certification exam based on the latest Fabric release and replaces the previous Fabric Administrator and Fabric Developer certifications.

#### Events

For everyone interested in the latest news and information about what's happening with decentralized identity, join the Identity Special Interest Group.  [Every other Thursday at 8AM Pacific](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/IWG/2023+Meetings) the group meets to report on various activities across the ecosystem and to present specific relevant topics.  These are open calls and all are welcome.  You can also [check out recordings of past calls](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0MZ85B_96CF2of1wYrBpHPYlRWxQeyB1) to catch up on what the group has been discussing – recent recordings include presentations on governance, Zero Knowledge Proofs, interoperability and more.

You can find more Hyperledger calls and other events [listed on the community calendar](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/HYP/Calendar+of+Public+Meetings).

This newsletter is sent out to hundreds of Hyperledger developers. It is a collaborative effort. If you have a project release, pull request, community event, and/or relevant article you would like highlighted next week, please leave a comment for consideration.
