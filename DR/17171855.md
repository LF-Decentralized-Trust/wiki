#### Announcements

- [Check out the first episode in Hyperledger's new podcast series where we speak with Tracy Kuhrt, TOC Chair and Associate Director of Blockchain and Multiparty Systems Architecture at Accenture](https://project.linuxfoundation.org/hyperledger-foundation-podcast).  Every month we'll invite developers from across the Hyperledger ecosystem to share about why they're using Hyperledger projects and why they are actively involved in the community.
  

#### Code &amp; Projects

- If you're involved with running a Hyperledger project or lab we want to make sure you have what you need to be successful.  Check out our recent [blog post about the tools and services available to projects and labs](https://www.hyperledger.org/blog/2023/02/08/project-services-update-ensuring-hyperledger-projects-and-labs-have-access-to-the-tools-and-services-they-need-to-grow) to learn more about what's available to you.  And if you're looking for help with coding, documentation or research, [submit a project proposal for this year's Mentorship program](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/INTERN/Mentorship+Projects) and we'll connect you with someone who will work on that as part of their mentorship.  We'll be accepting project proposals through March 15.

#### Noteworthy Pull Requests

#### Articles, Training &amp; Tutorials

- Check out a new [blog post about benchmarking Hyperledger Fabric 2.5 performance](https://www.hyperledger.org/blog/2023/02/16/benchmarking-hyperledger-fabric-2-5-performance) written by Dave Kelsey, one of the maintainers of Hyperledger Caliper.  Hyperledger Fabric performance is a question that comes up frequently as users try to compare it to transactional databases or other blockchain platforms in terms of the maximum TPS (Transactions Per Second).  Learn more about how to benchmark performance in this post.

#### Events

- The International Women of Blockchain (IWB) conference is an exciting and inclusive DEI Web3 hybrid event focused on honoring and empowering women in the blockchain ecosystem during Women’s History Month.  The Hyperledger Foundation has partnered with IWB2023 to offer you discounted tickets to attend the conference in Washington, DC March 22-24th.
