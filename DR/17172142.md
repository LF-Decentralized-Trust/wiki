#### Code &amp; Projects

Open Enterprise Agent Lab

In case you missed the meetup, [check out the recording about the new Open Enterprise Agent lab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DA0FzL0uHA), a cutting-edge software agent designed for building decentralized identity applications and services.  There is an overview of the lab, a couple of demos and a discussion about the roadmap.  If you'd like to talk more about the lab or have questions, feel free to join the group for their regular bi-weekly calls.  [Their next call is Tuesday, December 12 at 7 AM Pacific and the calls are open to everyone](https://lists.hyperledger.org/g/labs/viewevent?repeatid=54457&eventid=2120420&calstart=2023-12-12).

#### Noteworthy Pull Requests

#### Articles, Training &amp; Tutorials

If there are technical topics related to Hyperledger projects that you're interested in learning more about, let us know what you're interested in.  We're starting to put plans in place for workshops to run in 2024 and would like to hear what topics people would like to see covered.  Take a look at what topics we've covered so far on our [Workshop library page](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/events/Workshops) and then leave a comment there about any new workshops you'd want to see.  If you need access to our wiki to leave a comment, you can [sign up for a free Linux Foundation ID](https://myprofile.linuxfoundation.org/).
