#### Code &amp; Projects

If you're interested in any of the Hyperledger projects, you are welcome to join any of the community calls.  Every project has regular calls that are open to everyone and no invitation is needed.  The calls are a good place to go to hear what's happening with a project and to get connected with the developers and maintainers who are actively involved in those projects.  [Check out the Community Calendar for a list of all upcoming calls and how to dial-in](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/HYP/Calendar+of+Public+Meetings).
