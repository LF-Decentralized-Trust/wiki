#### Announcements

We've just [announced the latest addition to the Hyperledger family - Hyperledger Identus](https://www.hyperledger.org/blog/announcing-hyperledger-identus-a-new-decentralized-identity-applications-project). The Atala team at IOG contributed this code base to Hyperledger Labs as Open Enterprise Agent in October 2023 and has since been working to grow a vibrant open source community to support it. Identus offers extensive Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) support built on the W3C Decentralized Identity specification including DID and verifiable credential functionality and simplifies the complexities of adopting a decentralized identity solution into existing and new workflows. [To learn more, join us for an online meetup on Wednesday, June 5 at 8AM Pacific all about Identus](https://www.meetup.com/hyperledger-sf/events/301045195/).

#### Code &amp; Projects

Hyperledger Iroha

[The Iroha project has announced Iroha `2.0.0-pre-rc.21`](https://lists.hyperledger.org/g/iroha/topic/hyperledger_iroha_bi_weekly/106152612), which is the final release before the first feature-complete release candidate, (`2.0.0-rc.1`). This version introduces major API changes, as well as improvements in performance and security. Highlights in this release include a new World State View implemented, filtering API simplified and more.

Hyperledger Solang

The [Solang Playground lab](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/solang-playground) is building a web based IDE that allows users to compile and interact with Solidity smart contracts in a browser environment, without prior installation of any of the needed components: Solang or Substrate contracts node. The aim here is to provide an experience similar to what Remix IDE provides, as Remix is the first tool Solidity developers get introduced to in their smart contract learning track. If you're interested in learning more, [join a virtual meetup on Thursday, June 6 at 10:00 Pacific](https://www.meetup.com/hyperledger-cairo/events/300946392/).
