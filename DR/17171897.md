#### Announcements

#### Code &amp; Projects

If there's a Hyperledger project you're interested in learning more about, starting to use or contribute to, then please feel free to join one of the project's open community calls.  All calls in the community are open for you to attend and you're welcome to dial-in and just listen or to ask questions and take part in discussions.  [Check out our Community Calendar to see when project calls are scheduled and how to dial-in](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/HYP/Calendar+of+Public+Meetings).

#### Noteworthy Pull Requests

#### Articles, Training &amp; Tutorials

Hyperledger staff have published an a[rticle that explains how the community managers the full lifecycle of a project](https://www.hyperledger.org/blog/2023/03/15/helping-a-community-grow-by-pruning-inactive-projects) from launch, growth, maturity and end of life.  Managing the full lifecycle of projects, and removing projects from the community when they become inactive, is a critical part of helping our community grow.  If you're interested in community management and how a large open source foundation operates, check out the post about [Helping A Community Grow By Pruning Inactive Projects](https://www.hyperledger.org/blog/2023/03/15/helping-a-community-grow-by-pruning-inactive-projects).
