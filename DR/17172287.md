#### Announcements

#### Code &amp; Projects

Zeto lab

[Zeto is a new Hyperledger Lab](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/zeto) that provides a toolkit to build privacy-preserving solutions for fungible and non-fungible tokens. It utilizes a UTXO model to achieve high throughput by supporting parallel transaction processing. Confidentiality and anonymity are achieved by maintaining commitments in the smart contract rather than clear-text values. If you're interested in learning more, [join a virtual meetup about the Zeto lab on July 31](https://www.meetup.com/hyperledger-raleigh/events/302272196/).

Hyperledger Besu

For anyone who is interested in using Hyperledger Besu in the enterprise, [check out this recording of a recent meetup that covered Besu In the Enterprise, Ethereum Tooling, Rapid Deployment and more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5srpm8AKuhY).  This was recorded in London and features talks by the Hyperledger CTO, one of the Besu maintainers, Founder and CEO of Web3 Labs, and Founder of Launchnodes.  And if you're interested in how Besu is being used in the financial services industry, [feel free to join the Besu Financial Services Working Group](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/BFFWG/).
