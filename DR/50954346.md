Check out this new [blog post about how the introduction of the ***HSMAwsKMSRequestProcessor*** class has made it easier to adopt and implement AWS's Key Management Service (KMS)](https://www.lfdecentralizedtrust.org/blog/hyperledger-web3jhsm-support-for-aws-kms) using  Hyperledger Web3j. And to learn more about Web3j, a modular, reactive, type safe Java and Android library for smart contracts and integrating with clients on the Ethereum network, [join an online meetup on Thursday, November 21 at 8:30 AM Pacific to get the latest information about Web3j from project maintainers](https://www.meetup.com/lfdt-london/events/304029316/).

In case you missed it, [check out the recording of the hands-on technical session about how to develop decentralized identity solutions using Hyperledger Identus](https://www.youtube.com/live/LdxK3t05PwI). The maintainers walk through the basics of everything you need to know from setting up your agent to connecting it with an SDK.

#### Events

For anyone near Toronto on Nov 19, [you're invited to attend a meetup hosted by the LFDT Toronto and Cardano Blockchain Toronto groups from 7 to 9PM EST](https://www.meetup.com/lfdt-toronto/events/304248214/).
