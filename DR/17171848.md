#### Announcements

Hyperledger has [free passes to give out to anyone who is interested in attending DeveloperWeek in person in Oakland on Feb 15-17 or virtually on Feb 21-23](https://bit.ly/3DxFJLK).  The pass will give you access to all OPEN Talks and to the Expo.  We wanted to share the passes with everyone who has signed up for our developer newsletter.

During the annual DEVIES awards ceremony at DeveloperWeek, Hyperledger will also be receiving the award for Best Innovation in Blockchain, Cryptocurrency and Web3.  It would be great to see you there and celebrate receiving this award in person with other community members.

#### Code &amp; Projects

- There is a new [Code With Us opportunity to Create an Aries Mobile Verifier Capability](https://marketplace.digital.gov.bc.ca/opportunities/code-with-us/1b4e02e9-8a2e-4970-9f12-fb2f0a827ea1).  The Government of British Colombia is offering $CDN 35,000 for this feature and all community members are welcome to submit a proposal to deliver the design and implementation.
- Community members have recently restarted development of the Hyperledger Explorer code, so if you were a user of Explorer or were interested in that project check out what is happening in the [Blockchain Explorer lab](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/blockchain-explorer).  The group also recently rescheduled their weekly call to make it a better time for community members in North America and they now happen [every Wednesday at 9AM Eastern and you are welcome to attend](https://lists.hyperledger.org/g/labs/calendar).
- [Hyperledger Iroha](https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha) is a DLT designed to be simple and easy to incorporate into infrastructural or IoT projects and they project developers are working on a version 2 release.  As part of that work, they are also working on a new Explorer tool – [check out the demo video they've put together to see the Iroha Explorer tool in action](https://youtu.be/aze3jwW6d-U).
