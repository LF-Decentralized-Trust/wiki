#### Announcements

Note that we will not be sending out an issue of the /dev/weekly newsletter next week due to the Thanksgiving holidays in the US.  We'll be following up the week after with a new issue of the newsletter.

#### Code &amp; Projects

Hyperledger Cacti

In case you missed it, check out the recording of the [Atomic Cross-Ledger Transactions Between Besu &amp; Corda Ledgers using Hyperledger Cacti v2 workshop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZpiJtCg6Ag).  The presenters will demonstrate how to create, test and demo an application from scratch using the second major release of the Hyperledger Cacti blockchain interoperability framework and the Harmonia lab.

#### Noteworthy Pull Requests

#### Articles, Training &amp; Tutorials

For anyone interested in how blockchain is being used to create Central Bank Digital Currencies) check out a recent blog post about [The Case for Open Development as the Foundation for Central Bank Digital Currencies](https://www.hyperledger.org/blog/the-case-for-open-development-as-the-foundation-for-central-bank-digital-currencies).  Developing a new form of currency means, at a minimum, adding a layer to the payment ecosystem and often creating a whole new one. And, while it is a sovereign currency, it must work in a global economy as well. That’s no easy undertaking.  Open development and open innovation helps make this possible.
