#### Announcements

#### Code &amp; Projects

Hyperledger Aries

There is a discussion happening on the Hyperledger Aries mailing list about [maintainers considering transitioning Aries Cloud Agent Python and related projects into the Open Wallet Foundation](https://lists.hyperledger.org/g/aries/topic/discussing_the_future_of/107866456). They think this could increase the visibility of our project, bring in more contributors, and improve interoperability with projects like Credo and Bifold. Check out the thread and feel free to respond if you have any questions or comments.

Hyperledger Cacti

One of the Hyperledger Cacti maintainers wanted to raise the awareness of being able to re-use Open API types ACROSS packages and their openapi.json files respectively. This is easier than the previously process where you needed to use the direct HTTP link to a pinned version of the openapi.json file stored on GitHub.  If you're interested in learning more about this new approach, [check out the note on the Cacti list and the comment on Github](https://lists.hyperledger.org/g/cacti/topic/cross_package_reusability_of/107883791).
