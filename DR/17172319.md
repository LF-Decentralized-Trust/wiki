Hyperledger Fabric

GalaChain is using Hyperledger Fabric to create the ultimate entertainment blockchain.  [Check out a recent blog post to learn more about GalaChain's secure, low-cost and builder-friendly L1 blockchain they're building for gaming applications](https://www.hyperledger.org/blog/galachain-leveraging-hyperledger-fabric-to-create-the-ultimate-entertainment-blockchain) and challenges and solutions they came up with for their network.  Gaming applications can be especially demanding on a blockchain and Hyperledger Fabric allowed GalaChain to build an efficient entertainment ecosystem.
