#### Announcements

#### Code &amp; Projects

Hyperledger Ursa was approved as a new project in November 2018 with the goal of creating a shared library to avoid the duplication of cryptographic implementations in other projects.  Having a shared library would mean that maintenance would be easier, and security bugs would be less numerous.  Hyperledger Ursa was an innovative project but it has been moved to archived status since the original maintainers were no longer able to devote time to it.  Code from Ursa still lives on in numerous other projects and one of the original maintainers has also started a new lab called Agora that is focused on the advancement of cryptography libraries and software.  [Check out our blog post about the Ursa project to learn more about what the project accomplished and what is happening today in the community with cryptographic developments](https://www.hyperledger.org/blog/blockchain-pioneers-hyperledger-ursa).

#### Noteworthy Pull Requests

#### Articles, Training &amp; Tutorials

If you're looking to learn new skills in 2024, check out our free learning resources.  We have [free online self-paced courses about a number of different topics](https://www.hyperledger.org/learn/training) and we have [in-depth technical workshops run by the maintainers of most of the Hyperledger projects](https://www.hyperledger.org/use/tutorials).  If you're looking for something that isn't available on either of those two pages, [let us know](mailto:info@hyperledger.org) and we'll be happy to help point you to other resources.
