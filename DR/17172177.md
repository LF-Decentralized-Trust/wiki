#### Announcements

Hyperledger's [2024 Mentorship program](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/INTERN/Mentorship+Projects) is kicking off with a call for project ideas that is open until March 15.  If you are involved with a Hyperledger project, lab or other community effort and you'd like to work with a mentee on something related to code, documentation or research then consider [submitting a project proposal](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/INTERN/Mentorship+Projects).  In previous years we've seen mentees make valuable contributions to the community and some people have stayed involved with the community and even become maintainers for projects that they were working on as a mentee.

#### Code &amp; Projects

If you're interested to see how Hyperledger projects are being used in production systems, [check out our Case Study library](https://www.hyperledger.org/case-studies).  There are many in depth case studies there that cover over a dozen different industries ranging from digital assets, global trade, IOT and more.
