#### Announcements

We are excited to announce the launch of our new [Use Case Tracker](https://www.hyperledger.org/learn/use-case-tracker). This tool currently holds over 180 use cases, each one built utilizing Hyperledger technologies. These instances span a broad spectrum of efforts, with maturity levels ranging from fully ready for production to being in the proof-of-concept stage. We warmly welcome any additions to this collection. So, if you're using Hyperledger technology please feel free to [submit your use case](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScfRobdWwZX0JTv3_jx98DlMZ_BsP7beo2gt9ZPK3PoV1C5nA/viewform).

#### Code &amp; Projects

Hyperledger Aries

- A new version of Aries Cloud Agent Python has been released -- [0.9.0](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/releases/tag/0.9.0).  Release 0.9.0 is an important upgrade that changes (PR #2302) the dependency on the now archived Hyperledger Ursa project to its updated, improved replacement, AnonCreds CL-Signatures. This important change is ONLY available when using Aries Askar as the wallet type, which brings in both \[Indy VDR] and the CL-Signatures via the latest version of CredX from the indy-shared-rs repository.  [Read more in the release notes](https://lists.hyperledger.org/g/aries/topic/aries_cloud_agent_python/100375844?p=%2C%2C%2C20%2C0%2C0%2C0%3A%3Arecentpostdate%2Fsticky%2C%2C%2C20%2C2%2C0%2C100375844%2Cprevid%3D1690575537273844881%2Cnextid%3D1688043604379705960&previd=1690575537273844881&nextid=1688043604379705960).

#### Noteworthy Pull Requests

It’s hard to overstate the importance of digital identity: It governs every interaction online, from email and social media to ecommerce and critical financial transactions. Simply put, everyone must be able to trust that they are connecting with who they believe they are connecting with. If you are interested in this topic, read about [why you should join the Identity Special Interest Group](https://www.hyperledger.org/blog/2023/07/26/why-you-should-join-the-hyperledger-identity-special-interest-group).  You are welcome to attend their next session – [check out their meeting schedule, learn more about the group and find our meeting meeting notes archive](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/IWG/Identity+Special+Interest+Group).

#### Articles, Training &amp; Tutorials

#### Events

Many community members are away during August and there tend to be fewer events and some regular calls get canceled.  With fewer community calls happening, this is a great chance to check out the [Hyperledger YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7_X0WkMtkWzaVUKF-PRBNQ) and see some of the recent events, calls and meetups you might have missed.  There are recent videos about the Blockchain Explorer lab, presentations from Special Interest Groups and more.

You can find more Hyperledger calls and other events [listed on the community calendar](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/HYP/Calendar+of+Public+Meetings).

This newsletter is sent out to hundreds of Hyperledger developers. It is a collaborative effort. If you have a project release, pull request, community event, and/or relevant article you would like highlighted next week, please leave a comment for consideration.
