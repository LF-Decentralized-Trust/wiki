#### Announcements

#### Code &amp; Projects

Web3j

Since it started as a new Hyperledger project earlier this year, maintainers have focused on significantly enhancing [Hyperledger Web3j](https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/web3j), a crucial tool for Java and Android developers working within the Ethereum ecosystem. The Web3j community has concentrated on improving decentralized identity solutions, expanding support for new types of transactions, and refining the tools developers use to build, test, and deploy blockchain applications. [Check out this blog about the major Web3j updates in 2024 to learn more](https://www.hyperledger.org/blog/hyperledger-web3j-in-2024-updates-for-blockchain-developers).

AIFAQ Lab

In case you missed it, [watch the recording of the recent meetup about the AIFAQ lab and see a demo of this AI-powered chat bot in action](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgQ8ybJgMLc).  The lab is focused on building an open source conversational AI tool that supports users and helps them avoid wading through oceans of documents to find information they are looking for.  [Check out the AIFAQ Github repo to learn more](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/aifaq).

#### Events

For anyone near Cincinnati on September 26 there will be an [in person Hyperledger meetup hosted by Veritas Automata starting at 5 PM](https://www.meetup.com/hyperledger-cincinnati/events/302790763/).  The discussion will focus on advantages and solutions of Hyperledger Fabric for Life Sciences and Healthcare and food and beverages will be provided.
