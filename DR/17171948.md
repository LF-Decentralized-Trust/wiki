#### Announcements

On Tuesday, June 20 at 8AM pacific join us for an [in-depth technical workshop and demonstration of using Bevel and the new Bevel-Operator-Fabric](https://zoom.us/meeting/register/tJcrdOqrqD8uGtdHQSapt-cS55XzWJC_TnXs) to deploy Hyperledger Fabric on Kubernetes.  The Hyperledger Bevel developers have [recently integrated hlf-operator, a Hyperledger lab, into Hyperledger Bevel](https://www.hyperledger.org/blog/2023/04/27/introducing-kubernetes-operators-in-hyperledger-bevel-with-bevel-operator-fabric) and have renamed it to Bevel-Operator-Fabric.  Adding Bevel-Operator-Fabric is an important milestone for Hyperledger Bevel and a step towards the redesign of Bevel with support for Kubernetes operators to achieve DLT (distributed ledger technology) network deployments and automation.  [Sign up for the workshop](https://zoom.us/meeting/register/tJcrdOqrqD8uGtdHQSapt-cS55XzWJC_TnXs).

#### Code &amp; Projects

For anyone who was using the Hyperledger Explorer project, check out the [Blockchain Explorer lab](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/blockchain-explorer).  This lab is an effort to take the Hyperledger Explorer code and update and extend it after the project was moved to End of Life status in 2022.  The group [meets every other Wednesday](https://lists.hyperledger.org/g/labs/calendar) and you're welcome to join their calls or connect with them on the [#blockchain-explorer channel on Discord](https://discord.com/channels/905194001349627914/1039606111654920255) if you have any questions or want to get involved.
