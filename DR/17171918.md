#### Announcements

Interested in how blockchain is being used to address climate change challenges?  You're invited to a [discussion with Prabhir Mishra, Co-founder TRST01 on Tuesday, May 2 @ 8AM Pacific about decarbonization using decentralisation](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/CASIG/CA2SIG+-+Meeting+May+2) that will include information about a blockchain enabled ESG reporting tool. To get notifications about this and other upcoming climate related presentations and to join the discussion with other community members about this topic, [sign up for the Climate Action and Accounting Special Interest Group's mailing list](https://lists.hyperledger.org/g/climate-sig).

#### Code &amp; Projects

Announcing the Aries Cloud Agent Python Documentation Site: [aca-py.org](http://aca-py.org)

An Aries Cloud Agent Python documentation site is now available at [https://aca-py.org/](https://aca-py.org/). The website is derived from the documentation in the ACA-Py site, with the documents organized into sections for easy navigation. No more navigating plain old GitHub folder lists to find the ACA-Py documents you need!  The new site supports multiple ACA-Py releases, defaulting to the current contents of the main branch. The source documents are in the ACA-Py repository, so updates will continue to be applied there.  Next up will be some reorganization of the documents in the ACA-Py repository to reduce the manipulation done as part of the publishing process, and a refresh pass through the documents to correct any outdated information.

#### Noteworthy Pull Requests

#### Articles, Training &amp; Tutorials

Coming soon: The [Hyperledger Fabric Certified Practitioner (HFCP) exam](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/certification/hyperledger-fabric-certified-practitioner-hfcp/) allows candidates to demonstrate their understanding of the fundamentals of blockchain technology, the Hyperledger Fabric model and networks, including designing production deployments. If you’d like to be notified as soon as the exam is available, you can sign up on the [Hyperledger Fabric Certified Practitioner (HFCP) exam](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/certification/hyperledger-fabric-certified-practitioner-hfcp/) page.  This is a new certification exam based on the latest Fabric release and replaces the previous Fabric Administrator and Fabric Developer certifications.
