Hyperledger Identus

If you're interested in learning about the newest Hyperledger project, [check out a recording of a recent meetup where the maintainers explain what Identus is and how to get involved](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1_oJ5oKUhk).  In the recording you'll learn about how Identus offers a modular solution tailored for effortless prototyping and seamless integration of SSI (self sovereign identity) into diverse platforms.  [Slides from the event are also available](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1F6177oe9tqpHKAYwGN6BX1dLzaPwVAsM/view?usp=sharing).

Hyperledger Cacti

In Portugal, Blockchain.PT has been established as a nationwide coalition to use blockchain technology to foster innovation and seize international business opportunities.  By making DLT interoperability core to its agenda, Blockchain.PT is removing a barrier to widespread adoption of the infrastructure it is so carefully developing.  [Read a recent blog post about how Hyperledger Cacti is being used and how Blockchain.PT plans to contribute back to the community to advance the state of enterprise-grade blockchain interoperability](https://www.hyperledger.org/blog/portugals-blockchain.pt-uses-hyperledger-cacti-as-its-interoperability-framework).
