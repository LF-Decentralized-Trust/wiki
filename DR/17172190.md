#### Announcements

We've recently [launched a new Hyperledger store with all new items including shirts, hoodies, hats and more](https://store.hyperledger.org/).  Check out the new swag that is available and support the community by picking up an item and wearing it.  More items will be coming soon so keep an eye on the store to see what gets added.

#### Code &amp; Projects

If you're interested in getting a preview of the Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) ordering service coming in the Hyperledger Fabric 3.0 release, [check out the Fabric docs for more information](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/whatsnew.html#what-s-new-in-hyperledger-fabric-v3-0) or [watch this recording of a meetup with one of the Fabric maintainers who worked on the new BFT support](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSJjI7AgFPA). As an open source project, all of the development is happening in the open and you're welcome to get involved with the community to see what is being worked on and to help out with getting new versions ready to release.

#### Noteworthy Pull Requests

#### Articles, Training &amp; Tutorials

#### Events

In case you missed it, the [recording of the Hyperledger 8th anniversary webinar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9k2fcdZWZk) is now available on YouTube.  The video includes a number of community leaders who spoke about the impact that Hyperledger has had since it was created and shared their thoughts on what's coming next on topics include digital assets, tokenization, inteoperability and more.

You can find more Hyperledger calls and other events [listed on the community calendar](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/HYP/Calendar+of+Public+Meetings).

This newsletter is sent out to hundreds of Hyperledger developers. It is a collaborative effort. If you have a project release, pull request, community event, and/or relevant article you would like highlighted next week, please leave a comment for consideration.
