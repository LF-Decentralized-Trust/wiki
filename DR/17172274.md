#### Announcements

The Hyperledger Foundation does not provide funding for projects, but we do want to help maintainers identify funding opportunities that may support their efforts. We've just posted [a page on the wiki that contains links to potential funding opportunities](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/HYP/Funding+Opportunities+for+Projects) that are relevant to projects in the Hyperledger community and we wanted to share this with community members.  To learn more about one of the funding opportunities on that page, you are welcome to [join the Climate Action and Accounting SIG call on Tuesday, June 25 2024 at 8 AM Pacific where there will be a presentation about Gitcoin Grants](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/CASIG/CA2SIG+Meeting+June+25+2024).
