Hyperledger Indy and Aries

The Hyperledger Telecom Special Interest Group has [published a new solution brief about the concept of a Telecom Decentralized Identity Network (TDIDN)](https://www.hyperledger.org/blog/introducing-the-telecom-decentralized-identity-network-tdidn-a-new-approach-to-security-efficiency-and-privacy), a new way to improve identity management using decentralized identifiers (DID) and blockchain that uses Hyperledger Indy and Aries. This brief explores how TDIDN's innovative approach can improve security, efficiency, and privacy in telecom operations. [On Thursday, May 16 at 9AM Pacific you're invited to a discussion with the authors of the paper about the Telecom Decentralized Identity Network](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/TCSIG/Telecom+Decentralized+Identity+Network), a solution that leverages decentralized identities and blockchain technology to revolutionize identity management in the telecom industry.
