#### Announcements

The Hyperledger Fabric v3.0.0-beta has been released.  The major feature in v3.0.0 is the [Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) ordering service based on the SmartBFT consensus library](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSJjI7AgFPA&t=784s). Hyperledger Fabric has utilized a Raft crash fault tolerant (CFT) ordering service since version v1.4.1. While the Raft CFT ordering service will continue to be available, a Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) ordering service can withstand not only crash failures, but also a subset of nodes behaving maliciously. Consider using the BFT orderer if true decentralization is required, where up to and not including a third of the parties running the orderers may not be trusted due to malicious intent or being compromised. [For more about what's in the beta release, check out the note on the Fabric list](https://lists.hyperledger.org/g/fabric/topic/announcement_hyperledger/104935020?p=%2C%2C%2C20%2C0%2C0%2C0%3A%3Arecentpostdate%2Fsticky%2C%2C%2C20%2C2%2C0%2C104935020%2Cprevid%3D1710448741305186831%2Cnextid%3D1708424590901277489&previd=1710448741305186831&nextid=1708424590901277489).

#### Code &amp; Projects

Hyperledger Bevel

The maintainers of Hyperledger Bevel are starting work on a [Kubernetes Operator for Hyperledger Besu](https://github.com/sownak/bevel-operator-besu) and they're looking for your help.  They currently have a Helm based operator only and are looking to evolve that into a complete operator for Hyperledger Besu as a way to make deploying Besu networks easier and quicker.  If you're interested, check out the recording of their recent meetup about [Deploying Production Networks with Hyperledger Bevel Helm Charts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_ltGhf-gyo) and check out the new [repo for the bevel-operator-besu](https://github.com/sownak/bevel-operator-besu) development.

Hyperledger Iroha

[The Hyperledger Iroha project is putting out a call for contributors](https://www.iroha.tech/contribute).  Iroha is a straightforward distributed ledger technology (DLT), inspired by Japanese Kaizen principle — eliminate excessiveness (muri) and it is being used in a [production central bank digital payment system](https://soramitsu.co.jp/centralbanking).  If you're interested in the opportunity, check out the [Iroha Tutorial](https://hyperledger.github.io/iroha-2-docs/) to get familiar with what it does and then pick up a [good first issue](https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20sort%3Aupdated-desc%20label%3A%22good%20first%20issue%22) to start contributing.

#### Noteworthy Pull Requests

#### Articles, Training &amp; Tutorials

If you're interested in learning about the newest Hyperledger project, join us for an [in depth technical deep dive about Web3j in English on Thursday, March 28](https://zoom.us/meeting/register/tJArdu6trjkoE9Lvnr4_4L-0GJgIF2VGdKMT#/registration).  Web3j is a lightweight, highly modular, reactive, type safe Java and Android library for working with Smart Contracts and integrating with clients (nodes) on the Ethereum network.

#### Events

You can find more Hyperledger calls and other events [listed on the community calendar](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/HYP/Calendar+of+Public+Meetings).

This newsletter is sent out to hundreds of Hyperledger developers. It is a collaborative effort. If you have a project release, pull request, community event, and/or relevant article you would like highlighted next week, please leave a comment for consideration.
