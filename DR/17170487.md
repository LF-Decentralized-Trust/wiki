    Experimental offline backup and restore was added via the operator
x-backup-state and operator x-restore-state CLI commands. Data
formats will be fluid for as long as the x- prefix is present in
the CLI so it is advised not to rely on these backups for disaster
recovery.#1235

    Experimental ethstats support added via the Xethstats and
Xethstats-contact CLI commands #1239
