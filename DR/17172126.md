#### Announcements

The Hyperledger Foundation has recently been updating and enhancing our security policies and practices.  Arun S M, Vice Chair of the Hyperledger TOC, and Hart Montgomery, CTO of the Hyperledger Foundation, discuss why this is important and what changes have been made in the blog post [Security First Approach at Hyperledger Foundation](https://www.hyperledger.org/blog/security-first-approach-at-hyperledger-foundation).  This post provides a summary of the key highlights from the updated security policy for vulnerability reporting and addressing processes as well as additional measures that the Technical Oversight Committee is working on to strengthen the governance of security issues in the Hyperledger community.
