Hyperledger Aries

The [Aries Cloud Agent Python 1.0.0 Release Candidate 5 has been published](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/releases/tag/1.0.0rc5) and is ready for verification by the community. Anyone using ACA-Py is requested to try out this release candidate in your test environments and report back on the results -- good or bad -- so we have data on which to base a final release decision.  We think we are very close with this milestone release. Please email the [Aries mailing list](https://lists.hyperledger.org/g/aries), post on [Discord](https://chat.hyperledger.org/), or [post an issue](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/issues) about your test results.
