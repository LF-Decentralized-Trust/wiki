Aries Cloud Agent Python (ACA-Py) Release 0.8.0

0.8.0 is a breaking change release that contains several new features and many (many) updates to existing functionality. The biggest addition is the inclusion with ACA-Py of a universal resolver interface, allowing an instance to have both local resolvers for some DID Methods and a call out to an external universal resolver for other DID Methods. Another significant new capability is full support for Hyperledger Indy transaction endorsement for Authors and Endorsers. A new repo [aries-endorser-service](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-endorser-service) has been created that is a pre-configured instance of ACA-Py for use as an Endorser service.

A recently completed feature that is outside of ACA-Py is a script to migrate existing ACA-Py storage from Indy SDK format to Aries Askar format. This enables existing deployments to switch to using the newer Aries Askar components. For details see the converter in the  
[aries-acapy-tools](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-acapy-tools) repository.

ACA-Py container images are now published as part of the release pipleine to the [Hyperledger organization GitHub Container Registry](https://github.com/orgs/hyperledger/packages?repo_name=aries-cloudagent-python). Other artifacts are published to the usual places, [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/aries-cloudagent/) and internal docs on [ReadTheDocs](https://aries-cloud-agent-python.readthedocs.io/en/0.8.0/).

This release includes 114 pull requests from 32 different contributors, including 16 new contributors to the repository. Thanks to all that contributed to this important new release.

Please see the [ACA-Py 0.8.0 Release Notes](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/releases/tag/0.8.0) for release details.

#### Noteworthy Pull Requests

#### Articles, Training &amp; Tutorials

Hyperledger staff have published an a[rticle that explains how the community managers the full lifecycle of a project](https://www.hyperledger.org/blog/2023/03/15/helping-a-community-grow-by-pruning-inactive-projects) from launch, growth, maturity and end of life.  Managing the full lifecycle of projects, and removing projects from the community when they become inactive, is a critical part of helping our community grow.  If you're interested in community management and how a large open source foundation operates, check out the post about [Helping A Community Grow By Pruning Inactive Projects](https://www.hyperledger.org/blog/2023/03/15/helping-a-community-grow-by-pruning-inactive-projects).

#### Events
