#### Announcements

The Besu maintainers have decided to [change the name of the project from Hyperledger Besu to Besu](https://lists.lfdecentralizedtrust.org/g/besu/topic/information_about_changing/108526516).  With this change, you may notice that the community infrastructure for Besu will start using the new name and the new logo. For instance, the code will be moved to a [new repo on Github](https://github.com/besu-eth). In other Besu news, the [maintainers have shared plans for deprecating some legacy Besu features](https://www.lfdecentralizedtrust.org/blog/sunsetting-tessera-and-simplifying-hyperledger-besu), including Tessera privacy and smart-contract-based permissioning.  [Check out the post to learn more about the roadmap](https://www.lfdecentralizedtrust.org/blog/sunsetting-tessera-and-simplifying-hyperledger-besu) and what options are available if you have been using any of those features.

#### Code &amp; Projects

ICYMI, [check out the recording of the recent meetup about the Splice lab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0M40hGvb7I) that is focused on extending Canton network interoperability &amp; harness tokenomics. The Canton Network has emerged as one of the leading venues for the tokenization of traditional financial and real-world assets with over $3T of assets being tokenized or processed across Daml-based applications in the network. [Watch the recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0M40hGvb7I) to discover how you can collaborate and build on the code driving the interoperability of applications on the Canton Network.

#### Noteworthy Pull Requests

#### Articles, Training &amp; Tutorials

- On Tuesday October 29th, join the Besu team for the workshop, "Besu Plug-ins: Fork-free Client Modifications to Extend Besu Use-Cases". 
  
  This will be an in-depth exploration of Besu plug-ins, where we’ll unveil how the plug-ins can enable fork-free client modifications to extend Besu’s use cases. This webinar is tailored for developers, architects, and blockchain enthusiasts who want to enhance their understanding of Besu’s architecture and learn how to implement custom features without the need for forking the client, modifying source code, or developing bespoke solutions. We will dive into real-world examples, showcase the flexibility of the plug-in framework, and discuss best practices for maintaining seamless compatibility while extending Besu to meet specific network requirements. 
  
  When: October 29. 2024 - 8am PT / 11am ET / 4pm CET

#### Events

For anyone who is a maintainer of a project or lab, you are invited to the Maintainer Days event in San Francisco on Oct 21 and 22. This is the first in person maintainer event we've hosted since before the pandemic in 2019.  [Check out what is being planned for those two days and learn more about how to register](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/events/Maintainer+Days+October+21-22%2C+2024).  There are several open slots in the agenda where you can sign up to present about your project and where you can add topics you'd like to discuss, so feel free to edit the wiki page or leave comments.

You can find more Hyperledger calls and other events [listed on the community calendar](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/HYP/Calendar+of+Public+Meetings).

This newsletter is sent out to hundreds of Hyperledger developers. It is a collaborative effort. If you have a project release, pull request, community event, and/or relevant article you would like highlighted next week, please leave a comment for consideration.
