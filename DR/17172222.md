#### Announcements

Every year Hyperledger runs a paid [Mentorship Program](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/INTERN/Hyperledger+Mentorship+Program) to create a structured hands-on learning opportunity for new contributors. Each mentee who applies and is accepted into the program will be matched with a mentor or mentors who are active contributors in the Hyperledger community. Each mentee will work remotely from their location of choice. [To learn more about the program and how to apply join us for a virtual meetup about the Mentorship program on Wednesday, April 10 at 9:00 AM AM Pacific](https://www.meetup.com/hyperledger-denver/events/299447539/).

#### Code &amp; Projects

Hyperledger Besu

[Hyperledger Besu](https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/besu), a Java-based client with an extractable EVM implementation that serves both public and private permissioned networks use cases, is emerging as critical infrastructure for next generation financial services. [A recent analysis by Blockdaemon of the technology powering the global tokenization ecosystem found that Hyperledger Besu was the most frequently mentioned protocol in a survey of 92 different firms](https://www.blockdaemon.com/resources/tokenization-data-insights), ranging from bank asset managers to clearing houses. More than 40% of the surveyed firms cited Hyperledger Besu as their protocol.
