#### Announcements

The Hyperledger FireFly community has [announced the release of version v1.3](https://www.hyperledger.org/blog/hyperledger-firefly-v1.3-is-now-available). Enhancements in this release make the industry’s first open-source Web3 Gateway an even more powerful platform for tokenization, multi-chain interoperability, and building blockchain-based applications. [Join us on Thursday, June 13 at 10 AM EDT for an online meetup showcasing what's new in the latest release and hear about what is next for Hyperledger FireFly](https://www.meetup.com/hyperledger-raleigh/events/301138155/).

#### Code &amp; Projects

The LF Edge community has [announced the new EdgeLake project](https://lfedge.org/projects/edgelake/) that uses a Plug &amp; Play approach to transform the Edge into a Virtual Data Lake. It allows users to query their distributed data, using SQL, as if the data is centralized (the physical data remains in-place). In addition, it provides a Single System Image (SSI) management to the distributed edge resources. EdgeLake leverages the blockchain and can be deployed on top of Hyperledger Fabric. If you're interested in how Fabric is being used for use cases in edge computing, [check out the EdgeLake project](https://lfedge.org/projects/edgelake/).

#### Noteworthy Pull Requests

#### Articles, Training &amp; Tutorials

#### Events

For anyone who will be at Blockchain Expo in Santa Clara, [join us for an Ask Me Anything session on Wednesday, June 5 from 1-2 PM with the Hyperledger Executive Director and CTO](https://www.meetup.com/hyperledger-silicon-valley/events/300787510/).  If you don't have tickets yet for Blockchain Expo, the organizers are offering a free Gold Pass to Hyperledger community members. [Check out the meetup page for the AMA to learn more](https://www.meetup.com/hyperledger-silicon-valley/events/300787510/) about the session and for how to get a free Gold Pass to the Blockchain Expo and the networking party after the event.
