#### Announcements

R3, in collaboration with Adhara, is proud to announce the launch of a new connectivity initiative – [Harmonia, a Hyperledger Lab](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/harmonia). To date, much of the work undertaken by financial organisations to solve interoperability challenges has been undertaken in private, hindering collaboration and impeding progress. The Harmonia Lab seeks to change this by fostering open, industry collaboration. By providing a platform for information sharing, Harmonia aims to bridge the gap between various stakeholders and facilitate a harmonisation of approaches. [Check out the lab to learn more and see how to get involved](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/harmonia).
