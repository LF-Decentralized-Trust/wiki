#### Announcements

You are invited to a hands-on [workshop about Atomic Cross-Ledger Transactions Between Besu &amp; Corda Ledgers using Hyperledger Cacti v2](https://zoom.us/meeting/register/tJUuce6tpzsqEt2DvUErQ0LnW1qsC0PCT9Dz#/registration).  Speakers will demonstrate how to create, test and demo an application from scratch using the second major release of the Hyperledger Cacti blockchain interoperability framework.  This is scheduled for Thursday, November 16 starting at 9AM pacific and is a great opportunity to learn more about the latest developments with enabling blockchain interoperability.  If you're interested, [register for the workshop](https://zoom.us/meeting/register/tJUuce6tpzsqEt2DvUErQ0LnW1qsC0PCT9Dz#/registration).

#### Code &amp; Projects

Hyperledger Cacti

Following the decision by the Hyperledger TOC on September 21, Hyperledger Cacti has moved from Incubating to Graduated Status. Congratulations to the FireFly contributors, maintainers and users on this milestone. 

Hyperledger FireFly

Following the decision by the Hyperledger TOC on September 21, Hyperledger FireFly has moved from Incubating to  Graduated Status. Congratulations to the FireFly contributors, maintainers and users on this milestone. 

Hyperledger Fabric

- Learn how Circulor is using Hyperledger Fabric to build a digital battery passport that proves sustainable, responsible, and circular sourcing for batteries used in electric vehicle (EV) batteries, light means of transport (LMT) batteries, and industrial batteries with a capacity over 2kWh in the European Union.  [Our new case study looks in detail at how this system tracks batteries through life cycles across the value chain and collates, stores, and displays relevant information about a battery’s entire life cycle.](https://www.hyperledger.org/blog/circulor-readies-market-for-new-regulations-by-adding-battery-passport-to-hyperledger-fabric-powered-traceability-platform)

Hyperledger AnonCreds

Mike Lodder joins the AnonCreds call this **Monday****, September 25 (7:00 Pacific / 16:00 Central Europe)** to discuss the newly accepted [Hyperledger Labs project](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/hyperledger-labs.github.io/pull/249) ["Agora"](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/hyperledger-labs.github.io/pull/249), a set of repositories that implement the AnonCreds v2.0 specification that we have been discussing, and more.

**Date/Time**: Monday September 25, 2023, 7:00 Pacific / 16:00 Central Europe  
**Zoom Link**: [https://zoom.us/j/97954159540?pwd=WWk3WmQ3MVh1SXBYZGVreGl0QllGdz09](https://zoom.us/j/97954159540?pwd=WWk3WmQ3MVh1SXBYZGVreGl0QllGdz09)

Mike has been working on this implementation for the past several years and we're excited to have the code made open source and available to use and expand upon. The implementation enables the new features that have been envisioned for AnonCreds v2.0, an evolution of the existing AnonCreds specification/implementation that provides:

1. Flexibility in the underlying signatures, including support for BBS+, PS and CL Signatures.
2. Expanded Issuer/Holder access to ZKP capabilities, such as set membership, range proofs, verifiable encryption and more.
3. The familiar participants, interactions, and objects of AnonCreds v1.0, enabling a clear and provend path to adoption

The project also includes a number of other generally useful cryptographic libraries that will be helpful for developers. An example is a key ring library for protecting secrets in memory from side channel attacks like Row hammer and ram bleed. Lots of fun/powerful tools for this space!
