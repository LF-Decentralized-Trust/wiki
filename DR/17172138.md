#### Announcements

The [Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/) is excited to announce a one-hour live-stream presentation at COP28, the United Nation's annual climate conference, that will explore the transformative power of open source and how it is being used to advance the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Featuring speakers from [Linux Foundation Research](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/research), [Linux Foundation Europe](https://linuxfoundation.eu/), [OS-Climate](https://os-climate.org/), [Hyperledger Foundation](https://www.hyperledger.org/), [AgStack Foundation](https://agstack.org/), [Fintech in Open Source Foundation (FINOS)](https://www.finos.org/), [Sustainable &amp; Scalable Infrastructure Alliance](https://www.ssia.org/), and the [ELISA](https://elisa.tech/) and [Zephyr](https://zephyrproject.org/) projects, the presentation will take place on December 6th from 15:00 - 16:00 GST in the COP28 Blue Zone.

#### Code &amp; Projects

Hyperledger Aries

We are pleased to announce the release of Aries Cloud Agent Python Versions [0.10.5](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/releases/tag/0.10.5) and [0.11.0](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/releases/tag/0.11.0). The most significant release is the latter -- 0.11.0, that adds a number of new features, some highlights are provided below. The only change in 0.10.5 (which is also in 0.11.0) is a fix to the JSON-LD Presentation verification code, to address an urgent bug.  Release 0.11.0 is a relatively large release of new features, fixes, and internal updates. 0.11.0 is planned to be the last significant update before we begin the transition to using the ledger agnostic [AnonCreds Rust](https://github.com/hyperledger/anoncreds-rs) in a release that is expected to bring Admin/Controller API changes. We plan to do patches to the 0.11.x branch if needed while the transition is made to using Anoncreds Rust.  [Read more in the release notes](https://lists.hyperledger.org/g/aries/topic/aries_cloud_agent_python/102835620?p=%2C%2C%2C20%2C0%2C0%2C0%3A%3Arecentpostdate%2Fsticky%2C%2C%2C20%2C2%2C0%2C102835620%2Cprevid%3D1701111322984777809%2Cnextid%3D1697479033291282860&previd=1701111322984777809&nextid=1697479033291282860).
