#### Announcements

The latest Community Spotlight posts are focused on the women leaders in our community sharing stories about their careers, what brought them to the blockchain space, what projects they’re excited about and advice they’ve received or have to share.  The first post is from [Nancy Norris speaking about the Government of British Columbia's Energy and Mines Digital Trust project](https://www.hyperledger.org/blog/spotlighting-hyperledgerwomen-stories-from-front-lines-of-community-building-nancy-norris-government-of-british-columbia) and the second post is from [Elli Androulaki, IBM Distinguished Engineer at IBM Research](https://www.hyperledger.org/blog/spotlighting-hyperledgerwomen-stories-from-front-lines-of-community-building-elli-androulaki-ibm-research).  If you have stories you'd like to share with the community about your involvement in Hyperledger, [reach out and let us know](mailto:pr@hyperledger.org).

#### Code &amp; Projects
