The latest post in our [Blockchain Pioneer blog series looks at the history and legacy of the Hyperledger Sawtooth, Grid and Transact projects](https://www.hyperledger.org/blog/blockchain-pioneers-hyperledger-sawtooth-grid-and-transact). Hyperledger Sawtooth was contributed in 2016 and brought a second DLT framework to the Hyperledger community and introduced several innovative features, including a modular architecture and the first use Confidential Computing with blockchains. Hyperledger Grid provided reusable components for implementing blockchain-based supply chain solutions and Hyperledger Transact created a shared software library that handles the execution of smart contracts.
