#### Announcements

The deadline to apply for this year's paid Mentorship Program is May 10. If you're interested in a structured hands-on learning opportunity that matches you with a mentor who is an active contributor in the Hyperledger community then make sure you apply in time. You can [find out details about how to apply on the wiki](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/INTERN/How+to+Apply) and if you have questions about the Mentorship program [check out the recording of a recent meetup about the program featuring previous mentors and mentees](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tP_AbLmAys).

#### Code &amp; Projects

Congratulations to [Tatsuya Sato from Hitachi for becoming a maintainer for Hyperledger Fabric](https://prtimes.jp/main/html/rd/p/000000327.000067590.html). Maintainers are people who have demonstrated a history of useful contributions and who help guide the development of the project and help others get involved. Becoming a maintainer is something that is open to anyone who is interested in contributing their time and expertise. If there is a project that you would be interested in becoming a maintainer for, we recommend that you get involved in the project's regular discussions and make some initial contributions. Once you connect with other project contributors and demonstrate your interest to contribute, you can speak with them about next steps with the process of becoming a maintainer.
