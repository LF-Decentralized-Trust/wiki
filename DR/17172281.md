Hyperledger Cacti

[Check out a blog post from the Principal Blockchain Engineer at Cheesecake Labs about how they built and contributing a Stellar connector for Hyperledger Cacti](https://www.hyperledger.org/blog/building-bridges-developing-the-stellar-connector-for-hyperledger-cacti).  Developing the connector as the established the essential communication bridge between Stellar and other blockchain networks within the Cacti framework and enabled the seamless integration of Stellar’s capabilities with Cacti, laying the groundwork for future, more complex interoperability features.

Hyperledger Aries

[The Energy &amp; Mines Digital Trust (EMDT) has successfully launched two digital credentials,](https://www.hyperledger.org/blog/energy-mines-digital-trust-the-future-of-global-supply-chains) reshaping how mining operators in British Columbia (B.C.) share verified data. EMDT uses [Traction](https://github.com/bcgov/traction), an enhanced multi-tenant Hyperledger Aries Cloud Agent Python (ACA-Py) enterprise wallet developed by the Government of British Columbia, that provides agents to multiple B.C. government authorities. The Government of B.C. uses Traction to establish DIDComm connections directly to mining operators’ corporate wallets to securely issue digital credentials, including the Mines Act Permit credential, using Hyperledger Aries protocols.
