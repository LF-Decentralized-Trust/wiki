#### Code &amp; Projects

Agora Lab

Agora is a new Hyperledger Lab designed to function as a secure &amp; collaborative environment for the implementation and advancement of cryptography libraries and software.  If you'd like to learn more about it, [join us for an online meetup on Thursday, Nov 2 @ 9AM Pacific](https://www.meetup.com/hyperledger-sf/events/296798409/).

Hyperledger Composer

We've started a new blog series looking at the now retired Hyperledger projects that helped drive innovation and advanced the development of enterprise-grade blockchain technologies.  [Our first post is about Hyperledger Composer, a platform for accelerating the development process of business network applications based on blockchain technology](https://www.hyperledger.org/blog/blockchain-pioneers-hyperledger-composer). Donated by IBM UK in 2016, Hyperledger Composer aimed to simplify the creation and management of assets, participants, and transactions on a blockchain network.  That Composer project is no longer active, but the legacy of Hyperledger Composer lives on in the large number of projects and labs that are making different aspects of using Hyperledger Fabric easier.  [Read the post to learn more about the innovations that came from Hyperledger Composer](https://www.hyperledger.org/blog/blockchain-pioneers-hyperledger-composer).
