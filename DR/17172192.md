#### Announcements

Hyperledger's [2024 Mentorship program](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/INTERN/Mentorship+Projects) is kicking off with a call for project ideas that is open until March 15.  If you are involved with a Hyperledger project, lab or other community effort and you'd like to work with a mentee on something related to code, documentation or research then consider [submitting a project proposal](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/INTERN/Mentorship+Projects).  In previous years we've seen mentees make valuable contributions to the community and some people have stayed involved with the community and even become maintainers for projects that they were working on as a mentee.

#### Code &amp; Projects

Aries Agent Controller

[Learn more about the Aries Agent Controller lab](https://www.hyperledger.org/blog/meet-aries-agent-controller-a-new-hyperledger-lab), a code base developed and contributed by Superlogic that facilitates deploying Hyperledger Aries agents in cloud environments.  The deployment of agents, particularly for decentralized identity systems like Hyperledger Aries, presents a unique set of challenges. These complexities range from managing scalable infrastructure to ensuring secure and efficient operation in diverse environments.  The [Aries Agent Controller lab](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/aries-agent-controller) addresses these issues through Kubernetes charts that the Superlogic team developed to deploy agents in cloud environments.

#### Noteworthy Pull Requests

#### Articles, Training &amp; Tutorials

The Web3j team will lead [Ethereum Development with Web3j and Java: A Hands-on Workshop](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/events/Ethereum+Development+with+Web3j+and+Java%3A+A+Hands-on+Workshop) on Thursday, March 28th at 8amPT/11amET/4pm GMT. Hyperledger Web3j is a highly modular, reactive, type safe Java and Android library for working with Smart Contracts and integrating with clients (nodes) on the Ethereum network. This allows you to work with the Ethereum blockchain, without the additional overhead of having to write your own integration code for the platform.  
To Register: [https://zoom.us/meeting/register/tJArdu6trjkoE9Lvnr4\_4L-0GJgIF2VGdKMT](https://zoom.us/meeting/register/tJArdu6trjkoE9Lvnr4_4L-0GJgIF2VGdKMT)

The Hyperledger Foundation will host the workshop, [Zero Knowledge Proofs and ZK Programming in Blockchain Application Development](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/events/pages/21794262/Zero+Knowledge+Proofs+and+ZK+Programming+in+Blockchain+Application+Development.) on Wednesday, April 24th at 8amPT / 11am ET / 4pm GMT. Zero knowledge proofs and SNARK systems are becoming one of the revolutionary technologies of the beginning of this century. In this workshop we will give a high-level introduction to the zero knowledge and SNARK technology stack rather from a software developer and IT professional perspectives with covering only slightly the deep mathematical basis. During the workshop we will implement an experimental zKRollup system in Circom on Hyperledger Besu or Fabric.
