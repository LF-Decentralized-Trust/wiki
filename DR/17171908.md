#### Announcements

- For anyone wondering about last week's issue of the newsletter that was full of 1s and 0s, we sent the issue of the newsletter in binary code as an April Fool's day joke.  Feel free to use this [binary code to text converter](https://onlinetexttools.com/convert-binary-to-text) to read that issue or you can see the news items from last week below.

<!--THE END-->

- The [Hyperledger Mentorship Program](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/INTERN/Hyperledger+Mentorship+Program) is accepting mentee applications now through May 10th. There is a [wide range of projects](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/INTERN/Mentorship+Projects) focusing on coding, documentation or research to choose from. If you are looking for hands-on and well-scoped contribution experience guided by open source professionals this is an opportunity not to be missed. Detailed application instructions can be found [here](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/INTERN/How+to+Apply). To learn more about the program, check out a sample of [last year's mentees' learnings and contributions](https://www.hyperledger.org/category/hyperledger-mentorship-program).  There will also be a [mentorship meetup](https://www.meetup.com/hyperledger-princeton/events/292303593/) on Thursday, April 13th at 9:00am Pacific. Several mentors will share what they're looking for in people who apply to the program and several previous mentees will share what their experience was like. We will also give an overview about the program and application process. We look forward to your participation.
