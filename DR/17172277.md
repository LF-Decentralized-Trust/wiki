#### Announcements

The Linux Foundation has [announced plans to form Linux Foundation Decentralized Trust](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/press/linux-foundation-announces-intent-to-form-lf-decentralized-trust). This will be a home for the open development of a broad range of ledger, identity, security, interoperability, scale, implementation, and related technologies. This will encompass the growing portfolio of Hyperledger projects and host new open source software, communities, standards, and specifications that are critical to the macro shift toward decentralized systems of distributed trust. [Check out the post about Linux Foundation Decentralized Trust to learn more](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/press/linux-foundation-announces-intent-to-form-lf-decentralized-trust).

#### Code &amp; Projects

Hyperledger Quilt was a Java implementation of the Interledger protocol that began in 2017 as a unique and innovative endeavor in the realm of blockchain technology that aimed to enable seamless transactions across different payment networks. The project was archived due to a lack of adoption and a shift in the strategic focus of the contributing organizations. Although the project is not currently active it demonstrated the importance of interoperability across enterprise-grade blockchain networks and paved the way for other similar projects that followed.  [Read more about the history and legacy of Hyperledger Quilt in our latest Blockchain Pioneers blog post](https://www.hyperledger.org/blog/blockchain-pioneers-hyperledger-quilt).
