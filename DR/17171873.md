#### Announcements

If you're looking for help with coding, documentation or research and interested in teaching and guiding new contributors, please submit a project proposal into this year's Mentorship Program. We will help connect you with someone who will work on the project as part of their mentorship. **Project proposals are being accepted through March 15.** Learn more about the annual Hyperledger Mentorship Program and reach out to [mentorship@hyperledger.org](mailto:mentorship@hyperledger.org) if you have any questions.

#### Code &amp; Projects

In case you missed it, there have been two good sessions on digital identity that are both available on the Hyperledger YouTube channel.  These provide an overview of the concepts and technology of decentralized identity and go over the Hyperledger AnonCred, Aries, Indy and Ursa projects that are being used to develop decentralized identity solutions.
