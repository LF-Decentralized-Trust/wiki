#### Announcements

We've recently published a blog post from Si Chen, about [Blockchain and the Energy Transition: Creating the Platform for a Sustainable Oil and Gas Industry](https://www.hyperledger.org/blog/2023/05/15/blockchain-and-the-energy-transition-creating-the-platform-for-a-sustainable-oil-and-gas-industry).  The post shares how Hyperledger projects such as Fabric, Besu and Cacti can be used by the oil and gas industry, its customers, investors, regulators, and the general public to work together faster and more efficiently.  For one example, smart contracts could turn the massive volumes of data from IOT sensors, drones, and satellites into metrics. Those metrics could then be used to create tokens, which could be traded or attached to physical products. The combination of metrics and tokens could then be used to prove climate benefits to investors and even structure investments.  [Check out the blog post](https://www.hyperledger.org/blog/2023/05/15/blockchain-and-the-energy-transition-creating-the-platform-for-a-sustainable-oil-and-gas-industry) to learn more and join [Hyperledger's Climate Action and Accounting Special Interest Group](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/CASIG/) if you'd like to connect with others looking at how blockchain can address energy and climate challenges.

#### Code &amp; Projects

Hyperledger AnonCreds

- If you're interested in learning more about the technology behind decentralized identity, join us for an in depth technical workshop about [how to use Hyperledger AnonCreds to issue and present Verifiable Credentials and how to use Zero Knowledge Proofs with Indy, Aries and other platforms](https://zoom.us/meeting/register/tJAqcOCurDstHdIAWH0mbPz2hLK55OPr1Hj_).  The workshop is happening on Wednesday, May 31 starting at 8 AM pacific.
