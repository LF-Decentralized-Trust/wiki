#### Announcements

Hear from developers at Infosys on [Monday, July 17 at 8AM Pacific about the Blockchain Explorer lab that is built on Hyperledger Explorer code](https://www.meetup.com/hyperledger-sf/events/294236338/) and learn how to use it for data visualization and hear about the the latest features &amp; future developments.  For anyone who was using Hyperledger Explorer and is interested in the latest information about what is happening with that code, this is a great event to attend.  If you miss it, we'll post the recording on the [Hyperledger YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7_X0WkMtkWzaVUKF-PRBNQ).
