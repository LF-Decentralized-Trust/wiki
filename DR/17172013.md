#### Announcements

Our editorial campaign for Q3 is #HyperledgerIdentity.  We will be doing an extra communications push around all things related to Hyperledger identity tech, SSI, VCs etc. If you're doing development related to identity, [send us content to promote](mailto:pr@hyperledger.org). The content you submit will be queued throughout the quarter for us to push on our social channels with the hashtag #HyperledgerIdentity.  We would also appreciate any engagement with our promotion once it is live.

#### Code &amp; Projects

Hyperledger Solang

Hyperledger Solang is a new compiler which helps bridge the gap between EVM developers and the Solana ecosystem.  Some of the highlights of Hyperledger Solang include compatibility with Ethereum Solidity 0.8, ability to call other Solana smart contracts, support for Solana SPL tokens and more.  Check out this [beginner’s guide](https://solana.com/developers/guides/solang-getting-started) to learn how to set up your development environment, write and test your first smart contract, and deploy it on the Solana network.

Blockchain Explorer Lab

If you missed last week's meetup about Blockchain Explorer, [check out the recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5Nz-r8BMgg) and hear about what the developers have been working on to update the Hyperledger Explorer code and what plans they have for future development.  The developers are also interested in your feedback about the usability, features, and performance of Blockchain Explorer, so feel free to [fill out this short survey to share your thoughts](https://forms.gle/CD5buyoV4kqA6waG7).  And if you have any questions about Blockchain Explorer, join the [#blockchain-explorer channel](https://discord.com/channels/905194001349627914/1039606111654920255) or go to one of their [community calls](https://lists.hyperledger.org/g/labs/calendar).

#### Noteworthy Pull Requests

#### Articles, Training &amp; Tutorials

Meet [Conor Svensson](https://www.hyperledger.org/blog/2023/07/17/meet-the-hyperledger-besu-maintainers-conor-svensson-web3-labs) and [Matthew Whitehead](https://www.hyperledger.org/blog/2023/07/13/meet-the-hyperledger-besu-maintainers-matthew-whitehead-kaleido), two of the maintainers of [Hyperledger Besu](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/BESU/) in our Q&amp;A series with Hyperledger community members.  These posts will give you insight into what these maintainers think are important about Hyperledger Besu and how it is being used.  If you're actively involved in the community and would like to share about the development you're doing, [reach out to us](mailto:community-architects@hyperledger.org) and we can talk about adding you to an upcoming Q&amp;A post.

#### Events

You can find more Hyperledger calls and other events [listed on the community calendar](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/HYP/Calendar+of+Public+Meetings).
