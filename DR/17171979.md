#### Announcements

In case you missed Blockchain Expo in Santa Clara in May, check out the [recordings of the Hyperledger Symposium there where we had speakers from the Hyperledger Foundation, Visa, Hitachi and Kaleido](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuXL4L6gWkc&list=PL0MZ85B_96CGkjCtMk7xg0wSxCd7Jqrb8) talking about what's happening in the community and how organizations are using Hyperledger projects to build solutions.

#### Code &amp; Projects

If you're looking to get connected with a mentor in the Hyperledger community who can help you get familiar with one of the Hyperledger projects, check out our new [Hyperledger Collaborative Learning Program](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/CLP/Collaborative+Learning+Program). The program offers mentoring resources to expand the number of new contributors receiving guidance on learning about Hyperledger projects and becoming a productive active contributor to the Hyperledger community.  [Learn more about the program and check out the projects you can apply for](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/CLP/Collaborative+Learning+Program).  Applications close on June 25.

#### Noteworthy Pull Requests

#### Articles, Training &amp; Tutorials

The new [Hyperledger Fabric Certified Practitioner (HFCP) exam](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/certification/hyperledger-fabric-certified-practitioner-hfcp/) will allow candidates to demonstrate their understanding of the fundamentals of blockchain technology, the Hyperledger Fabric model and networks, including designing production deployments. If you’d like to be notified as soon as the exam is available, you can sign up on the [Hyperledger Fabric Certified Practitioner (HFCP) exam](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/certification/hyperledger-fabric-certified-practitioner-hfcp/) page.  This is a new certification exam based on the latest Fabric release and replaces the previous Fabric Administrator and Fabric Developer certifications.
