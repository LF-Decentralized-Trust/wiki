#### Code &amp; Projects

[Hyperledger Web3j developers have announced that they've added support for the Ethereum Name Service (ENS)](https://www.lfdecentralizedtrust.org/blog/introducing-linea-ens-support-in-hyperledger-web3j). This will allow you to seamlessly integrate Linea ENS functionality into Java applications and make it easier to interact with human-readable domain names across the Ethereum ecosystem. Web3j developers are also seeking input from anyone developing DApps, smart contracts, or wallets using Android. [Fill out the survey about the Hyperledger Web3j Android version to help the developers improve the project and make it more useful](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfXqvvzE7EF2NNBzkm_xsNhKorjMSiBEIei8A3sDGXK2aPiig/viewform).
