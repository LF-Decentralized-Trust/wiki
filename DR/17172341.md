#### Announcements

#### Code &amp; Projects

[Hiero, the open source DLT codebase used to build the Hedera network, is taking part in Hacktoberfest this year](https://hiero.org/hacktoberfest/). The developers have come up with a range of issues, from beginner-friendly to advanced, so feel free to take a look and find an issue that looks interesting. By contributing to Hiero during Hacktoberfest, you can earn a limited edition T-shirt or plant a tree. And if you're near Dortmund, Germany, you can [join an in person Hiero Hacktoberfest event on Oct 17](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/jug-dortmund/events/303723659/).

#### Noteworthy Pull Requests

#### Articles, Training &amp; Tutorials

Community members from Brazil have helped written a [whitepaper on Applying Post-Quantum Cryptography Algorithms to a DLT-Based CBDC Infrastructure: Comparative and Feasibility Analysis](https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/1206). The paper look at how post-quantum cryptography (PQC) algorithms can help with security, transparency and reliability for distributed ledger solutions.
