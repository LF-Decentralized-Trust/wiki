#### Announcements

Note that there will not be an issue of /dev/weekly next week due to the Thanksgiving holidays in the US. We'll return with an issue the following week.

#### Code &amp; Projects

Read about how you can [use Hyperledger Bevel to add a privacy layer to permissioned Besu networks in a blog post written by Alvaro Picazo](https://www.lfdecentralizedtrust.org/blog/using-hyperledger-bevel-to-add-a-privacy-layer-to-permissioned-besu-networks), Senior Software Engineer at Accenture. Thanks to its powerful Helm Charts, Bevel includes all the necessary steps to initialize a DLT network, thereby simplifying the user’s task of manually executing all commands and cryptographic materials required for the correct operation of the network.

#### Noteworthy Pull Requests
