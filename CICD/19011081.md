### Discussion

- Talk about how we want to do requirements gathering.
  
  - Should we break up along teams and report back?
  - Should we assign one or two people to study each team's solution and report back?

## Minutes

- Dave space set up and requirements docs are up.
- Ry: we're budgeted to spend about ~$120k/year and we're currently spending about $60k this year so we do have some money to spend for some exploration with a parallel system.
- Dave: talking about requirements.
  
  - Kubernetes concerns:
    
    - Sawtooth
      
      - assumes a docker runtime under the docker building process.
      - also docker compose.
    - are any projects using Docker swarm or any other competing technologies that they would have to move away from?
  - Other platforms to look at.
    
    - CNCF is using Prow. What is Prow?
