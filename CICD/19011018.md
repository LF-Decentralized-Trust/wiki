## Minutes

- Dave: introduced the committee goal, scope, and deadline.
  
  - LF building a new CI as a service system as part of the CommunityBridge effort that will cut off support for our current Jenkins/Gerrit solution.
  - We should design a new system that not only gets all HL projects on to the same CI/CD platform but is also the same, or compatible with, the new LF system.
- Ry: we need to get all of the CI/CD costs added up, including all of the money spent by outside companies.
  
  - HL should be paying for all of the CI/CD used by projects.
  - New system needs profiling capabilities.
  - Most important feature is that tests either succeed or fail and there is forensic capabilities in the CI/CD platform to quickly know if a failure is a legitimate failure in the software.
- Shawn: must be driven by the PR process.
  
  - Both build passes as well as long-running tests.
- Silas: plan to have public facing test nets for people to pound on and try to induce failures.
