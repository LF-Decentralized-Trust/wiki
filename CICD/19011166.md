## Agenda

- Update on CircleCI
- Discuss long-term scalability
  
  - Can we use community contributed resources to reduce overall cost?
  - How are we going to scale the per-user license fee?

## Minutes

- Azure pipelines looks like a great solution and we are investigating. Here are the features we need that it supports:
  
  - Supports building for Windows, Linux and Mac OS
  - Supports using computing resources from different cloud providers.
  - Free for open source use.
  - Supports fine grained tagging of computing resources so that they can be assigned to specific projects to use.
  - Supports multi-staged build pipelines with heterogeneous build environments.
  - Supports tight integration with outside tools such as github and slack.
- Supporting multiple cloud providers is a huge advantage because we can ask for free resources through our social networks and then plug them into the pool of resources.
- Matt is going to test out moving some Fabric jenkins jobs to azure pipelines.
- Dave is going to ask Mike Lodder to try out the Ursa build.
