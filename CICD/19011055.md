# CI/CD : Archive: Analysis

Created by David Huseby on Apr 05, 2019

1. Background/Introduction
   
   1. Hyperledger has a CI/CD system based on Jenkins and Jenkins Job Builder. This system has been in operation for the lifetime of Hyperledger and is not meeting the needs of the community.
2. Project Goals and Scope of Service
   
   1. The goals are to make Jenkins
      
      1. more robust
      2. more easily available to the projects without the hurdle of learning JJB
      3. more useful by publishing artifacts where they need to be published
   2. The community has expressed the need to make the current Jenkins setup more responsive to the needs of the projects in general. This might include:
      
      1. putting the CI configuration within the projects themselves, instead of in the [ci-management](https://github.com/hyperledger/ci-management) repo
      2. adding publishing endpoints that are more useful to the community (bintray, Amazon AMIs)
      3. linking Jenkins to the chat system so that status is reflected in real time in chat
   3. Robustness might include
      
      1. the ability to re-run failed tests
      2. cache results for speedier builds
      3. better log parsing tools
3. Anticipated Selection Schedule
4. Timeline
5. Elements of Proposal
6. Evaluation Criteria
7. Documentation on CI. How to setup a new project with the existing macros, job id's, templates?
