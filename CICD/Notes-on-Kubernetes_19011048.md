# CI/CD : Notes on Kubernetes

Created by David Huseby, last modified by Artyom Bakhtin on May 06, 2019

This page document has all of the notes and analysis of how well Kubernetes meets all of the requirements.

# Orchestration platform selection suggestions:

## k8s:

## ++:

- well-supported
- extensible
- multi-tenant

## --:

- macos not supported; starting from Windows Server 2019
- multiplatform clusters not officially supported
- container runtime dependent (can orchestrate containers, but not VMs. Though effort to change this exists: [https://github.com/Mirantis/virtlet](https://github.com/Mirantis/virtlet))

# Nomad:

## ++:

- native support for multiplatform (arm, macos, windows) (can be compiled for other platforms)
- can orchestrate containers, processes, VMs, JARs

## --:

- bare-bones: no plugins, extensions, etc
- secret management is not natively supported (Vault)
- overlay networking is not natively supported

# Multi-tenant access to the cloud:

## ++:

- one-off agents
- easily customizable. Fits each team's needs
- cost-effective (?)

## --:

- build process is not unified across the projects
- more effort for build customization (but it probably already customized within each team)
