## Agenda

- Discuss solutions for docker-in-docker without requiring the docker daemon.
  
  - [Kaniko](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kaniko) builds docker images docker images from a Dockerfile on a Kubernetes cluster without requiring access to docker daemon.
  - [Buildah](https://github.com/containers/buildah) from RedHat [does something similar](https://thenewstack.io/red-hat-buildah-provides-a-way-to-build-containers-without-the-docker-daemon/).
  - [CBI](https://github.com/containerbuilding/cbi) provides a vendor-neutral interface for building (and pushing) container images on top of a Kubernetes cluster.
    
    - Supports backends [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), [BuildKit](https://github.com/moby/buildkit), [Buildah](https://github.com/projectatomic/buildah), [kaniko](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kaniko), [img](https://github.com/genuinetools/img), [Google Cloud Container Builder](https://cloud.google.com/container-builder/), [Azure Container Registry Build](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/container-registry/) and [OpenShift Source-to-Image (S2I)](https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image)
  - [Knative](https://boxboat.com/2018/08/10/building-containers-with-kubernetes-and-knative/) is a set of components that enables modern CI/CD workflows that are native to kubernetes.
    
    - Consists of the "build", "serving", and "eventing" components. The "build" component is similar to CBI and supports Kaniko and several others that aren't really relevant to HL projects.

## Minutes

- Artyom Kubernetes only supports Linux and x86.
  
  - How would we support builds for other architectures and other OSes like Mac OS?
  - Cross-compilation doesn't go well.
- Matt Sykes
  
  - Virtual machine based kublet vs container-based kublet.
  - Fabric pipeline expects to have the full docker stack and runs docker-compose.
  - Initiative to restructure a lot of the Fabric pipeline.
  - Test services such as ordering service uses docker-compose to run a network and orderer to run tests.
