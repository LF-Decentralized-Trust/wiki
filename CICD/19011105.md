## Agenda

- Report back:
  
  - Dave: investigate kube cpu credits, memory limits, cpu limits, and load balancing across namespaces.
    
    - Kubernetes has native support for resource quotas to ensure fair play among the various teams.
    - [https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/resource-quotas/](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/resource-quotas/)
    - [https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/quota-api-object/](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/quota-api-object/)
  - Srinivasan: figure out if any of our teams are using Docker swarm or any competing products.
  - Ryan: look into Sawtooth's existing pipeline and identify any pain points for moving existing infra to a kube cluster.

## Minutes

- Ry: propose to move the meeting to 9:30 am Pacific so that we don't run into meetings the previous hour.
- Ryan:
  
  - moving to kube cluster isn't going to be straight forward
  - it looks like the sawtooth pipeline requires access to the docker daemon and sharing the docker socket into a virtual machine
  - 100% of their build pipeline uses docker-compose.
  - developers use docker-compose locally to test and they don't want to switch to minikube.
  - Sawtooth CI pipeline starts with building the docker file for the CI pipeline runner
- Greg:
  
  - kompose and other tools translate docker-compose files to kubernetes.
  - there are tools like scaffold and draft that build kubernetes specs from docker files and handle the integration.

## Action items

- [David Huseby](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/5c81ef6e187e8e0b95b0b1e9?ref=confluence) email TSC about policy decisions.
