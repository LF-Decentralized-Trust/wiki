*15min*Discuss project issues

All

- Discussed v1.0.3 issues here: [https://github.com/hyperledger/quilt/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Av1.0.3](https://github.com/hyperledger/quilt/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Av1.0.3)
- [https://github.com/hyperledger/quilt/issues/399](https://github.com/hyperledger/quilt/issues/399)
- Created [https://github.com/hyperledger/quilt/issues/406](https://github.com/hyperledger/quilt/issues/406)

*15min*Stream \`SendMoneyResult\` enhancements?All

- StreamSender caller *may* need to be able to check-in on a payment, but probably just a nice-to-have because most payments won't be very long. Probably a premature feature at this point.
  
  - One idea: Call sendMoney with some kind of callback which can update the caller.
- ```
  gRPC endpoint needs to be able to tolerate disconnects. No changes to Quilt at this time.
  ```
