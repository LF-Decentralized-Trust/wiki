Intros

All

- George working to integrate iroha and Quilt.
- Lurii Vinogradov
- Kincaid, Neil, Noah, Ian, David: Working on ILP in Java and JS.

10minIroha and Quilt

- Iroha is a private permissioned blockchain.
- Iroha is in C++; Good permission model; lightweight, easy to deploy; use on mobile.
- No smart contract -
- Many Private networks all running same code. Intended for private enterprise blockchains (20-30 projects).
- CBDC in Cambodia (Bakank)
- Looking to connect/bridge different Iroha networks.
- Focused on financial transactions.

*45min*

Discuss STREAM sender improvements found in [https://github.com/interledger-rs/interledger-rs/pull/635](https://github.com/interledger-rs/interledger-rs/pull/635) and task this out.

All

- Kincaid
  
  - Sender wallet presents some max-amount that will leave your account.
  - StreamSender needs to enforce that this max is the most that leaves the account.
  - Question: Does the lower-level sender need knowledge around how much its delivering?
  - JS StreamController interface: break sender up into as many little state machines as possible (max packets; liquidity congestion; setting the amount and tracking amount paid; pacing).
- Neil
  
  - Durability is aimed at knowing the state of any given stream payment.
  - We could go back and retry. Or we could just do another payment.
  - How do we get a fixed amount in receiver's units where things like FX/slippage could be unknown until the sender gets it.
- What should STREAMSender do if the FX rate goes against the sender and the payment cannot be completed?
  
  - Kincaid: FX rates are that big of a deal because they don't fluctuate that frequently.
  - Could happen but is unlikely.
  - Bigger issue is sending packets that fail due to rounding errors, ultimately failing the payment.
  - Accurately probing an FX rate is pretty hard because different-sized packets have different rounding errors. Some packets divide nicely but others don't.
- **Ideas**
  
  - Fixed-exchange rate path guarantees could be an interesting solution here.
  - Many mini-state machines to control for each thing independently (e.g., amount delivered should be distinct from time).
  - Try to complete a payment, but plan on failure.
- **Kincaid**
  
  - Majority of incomplete payments are caused by unimplemented features or bugs in implementations.
  - Very tiny fraction of payments are caused by network errors or intermediary manipulation.
- Create a "guidance doc" for state machines and approaches to building a STREAM sender.
  
  - Notes on error-cases, better explanation.
  - Discussion around each "mini state machine"
- **Kincaid**
  
  - Opinion on best-practices is evolving.
