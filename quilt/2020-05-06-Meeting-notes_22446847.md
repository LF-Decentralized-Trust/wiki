*35min*

Discuss project issues

All

- Discuss StreamRFC PRs ([https://github.com/interledger/rfcs/pull/573](https://github.com/interledger/rfcs/pull/573)).
  
  - Quilt PR: [https://github.com/hyperledger/quilt/pull/459](https://github.com/hyperledger/quilt/pull/459)
- Neil: anecdote about the "refer" keyword in the HTTP spec that was specified as incorrect because this how everyone was doing it.
  
  - Maybe a ConnectionAssetDetailsRequest that can trigger the other side to send its CAD frame.
- Codec Failure Validation: [https://github.com/hyperledger/quilt/pull/456](https://github.com/hyperledger/quilt/pull/456)
- STREAM sender calculations:
  
  - Max amount
  - Min amount
  - Dust
  - slippage
  - connection failure statistics.
- Durable STREAM Sender
  
  - SimpleStreamSender is not simple.
  - **Goal**: Update a datastore to say "this is how much you sent" and Bisected Packet detection.
  - Bisected Packet Detection: In large-packet-amount world, you want to say, "I'm about to send a packet for 1000 units" so you can check it later in the event of a server crash.
  - Introduce a filter-chain
    
    - 1.) Help to figure out what the payment amount should be.
    - 2.) Persist the packet,
    - 3.) Log the packet, etc.
    - 4\) On response, do other things.
  - Parallelization of Packets introduces complexity
    
    - Current impl starts small and ramps up.
    - New Impl will start large and ramp down.
  - Try single-threaded simpler stream sender.
