Created by qinghui hou on Apr 02, 2019

Hyperledger Caliper Project

Community Regular Meeting

March 27, 2019 (8am – 9am UTC)

via Zoom

Members

Attila Klenik, Nick Lincoln, Yu Pan, Qinghui Hou.

1\. Have a look at Nick’s work about Caliper npm package. Nick want to module Caliper, and split Caliper into Caliper-core, Calilper-fabric, Caliper-iroha,Caliper-burrow, Caliper-sawtooth and so on.

2\. Attila want to use uniform adaptor for fabric. But the feature ‘high tps test’ has not been intergred into the ccp adaptor, so it is not right time for using uniform adaptor for fabric.

3\. Module monitor function of Caliper. Hou thinks monitor function can be moduled by making a npm package.

4\. Next week, we should join the PSWG meeting.
