==EMAIL FOR PERSONAL OUTREACH==

Hyperledger is hosting its first ever [Bootcamp in São Paulo on June 24-25 at Cubo Itaú](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/hyperledger-bootcamp-brazil-2019/)! Whether you're a diehard DLT enthusiast or just starting out on your blockchain journey, we designed this inclusive workshop to walk you through how to contribute to Hyperledger codebases, use our technologies, improve documentation and get involved in our enterprise blockchain community. [Register while space is still available](https://www.cvent.com/events/hyperledger-bootcamp-brazil-2019/registration-0e72c7c066124895996e4d50c4ea2aff.aspx?fqp=true), tickets are US$25 (R$96.96). 

The content for the Bootcamp is community-developed and led. Sessions can be study groups or someone presenting something they've worked on before and showing others how to do it. There can be overviews, but also deep dives on specific topics. Some sessions can even be spontaneously added to the schedule on the same day. If you would like to lead a session, please [submit a session proposal here](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/BSP/Sessions) (login/create your [LFID](https://identity.linuxfoundation.org/)--don't use social logins--and click on "submit a session proposal" then "Next").

We also have an opportunity for you to support this first event of its kind that Hyperledger is organizing in Brazil. During the Bootcamp we will have lunch on both days and an evening reception Monday evening.
