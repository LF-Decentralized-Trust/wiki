## Discussion items

ItemNotes/Lessons LearnedRegistration page

- Attendees think this is the only place with info and don't look on wiki

Event Emails

- Organizers (CA, Ecosystem, locals) need more visibility into timing and text of communications going out so that we can have input and make sure it's including the right information in

Swag

- logo on vest was incorrect, shouldn't have included 'technical ambassadors'

Organization &amp; Planning

- Good to have everyone (internal HL, local organizers) on a weekly call during the planning, use the wiki and have action items and notes
- Overcommunicate with local organizers, reminders for calls, action items

Timing

- This bootcamp was planned in a short timeframe ~2 months, recommend planning starting **minimum** 3 months. Allows buffer time for delays, last minute tendency of local organizers, etc.

Venue confirmation contract

Need to have contracts so things don't switch at the end

Events: with donated venues, they don't usually like contracts

Bootcamp planning roles

- Would be great to outline roles for each person on the organizing team so that it's clear who is handling what, i.e. CA team, Ecosystem team, Marketing, Events, Local organizers

Shipping

- Ship to hotels is best than home for those flying, barring customs issues
- Notify with more lead time who gets shipment to ensure proper pickup

Marketing

Start thinking of and planning marketing at the beginning

Involved local marketing contacts from members early on

Kickoff CallBring everyone together on HL side on a kickoff call to layout needs, tasks, involvement, roles (see above), availability, etc.ServerHave server in room with virtual machines in case people didn't download beforehandSurvey

did daily feedback

need survey results

Community

great feedback on how it really solidified Hyperledger community

people stepped up to help others who were more new

Follow Ups

- Get young Oracle presenter to do blog (or anyone else)
