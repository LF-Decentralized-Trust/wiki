Marketing and Promotion Strategy

- Bernardo, please add any other marketers you think we should work with to this email and we can continue the discussion and make some progress before Friday.
- Hyperledger/LF marketing is able to provide a $2,500 budget to execute a paid social campaign to increase registration.
- Given Bernardo's localization advice, we will reallocate the paid budget to some or all of the following:
- - Sponsor the existing or a new LinkedIn post from the Hyperledger account
  - Put paid support behind local blockchain social influencer Instagram posts
  - Run a Google Ad
- Bernardo will provide a recommended list of influencers in the local Hyperledger community with large IG following who will post about the event that we could potentially put paid support behind.
- Bernardo will share the LinkedIn post in the Whatsapp group and encourage people to share it out on their social channels as soon as possible
- Amanda and I will provide our recommendation for how we break out the budget across these potential platforms
- Once decided, we will target the following geos: São Paulo, Campinas, Brasilia, and either Curitiba or Rio de Janeiro
- Bernardo and team will provide keywords in Portuguese that should be included
