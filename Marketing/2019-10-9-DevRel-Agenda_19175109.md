# Marketing : 2019 10 9 DevRel Agenda

Created by Jessica Rampen, last modified on Dec 12, 2019

- Rocketchat channel created: [https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/marketing](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/marketing)
- Marketing Main Wiki page created (public): [https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/Marketing/Marketing+Home](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/Marketing/Marketing+Home)
- Project descriptions and taglines - believe many of the projects are in dire need of this. This stems from the most recent greenhouse graphic update, as we started using new terminology for the projects - distributed ledgers, libraries, tools or domain specific. We want to be consistent and carry this over to the project pages on the website, the wiki and other places. For example many projects use "framework" but we'd prefer "distributed ledger software" to emphasize that it's software.
- - We will work with project maintainers and Silona to get updated
- How can we best encourage developers to write up content on interesting new features, how-tos?
- [Developer showcase](https://www.hyperledger.org/category/developer-showcase)? Ask for volunteers to cover in a blog post and give recognition
- For those of you working with Fabric, letâ€™s get why Fabric from you for 2.0 launch (Dec timeframe)
