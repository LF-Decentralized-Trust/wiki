# Marketing : Defining Open Source Marketing &amp; Communications

Created by Jessica Rampen, last modified by Ben Thomas on Sep 11, 2023

Open source marketing builds consensus on communications and content strategy across varied project stakeholders.

Our marketing and communications strategy is developed on four pillars:

1. Grow awareness of Hyperledger Foundation, as a consortium formed to advance enterprise-grade blockchain technologies supported by The Linux Foundation.
2. Promote individual projects and their own respective communities, bringing awareness to specific features, developer activities and milestones reached.
3. Work closely with Hyperledger membership to highlight, promote and bring awareness to use cases and what they and their customers are doing with Hyperledger technologies.
4. Help educate the market on open source blockchain technologies to promote understanding and adoption.
