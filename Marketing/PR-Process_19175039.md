# Marketing : PR Process

Created by Jessica Rampen, last modified by Ben Thomas on Sep 11, 2023

For a project launch, PR will work with maintainers of the new project on coordinated media outreach, if deemed necessary. A spokesperson (1-2 maintainers) needs to be identified for the project. PR will need the spokesperson(s) availability the week of the anticipated launch. PR will then reach out to media and analysts offering briefings (conversations) to be had to learn more about the new projects and its features. PR may even included Hyperledger, Executive Director, Brian Behlendorf in the briefings, if appropriate. This outreach may occur BEFORE the launch if it’s a significant milestone or the DAY OF the launch, it really just depends and either strategy has worked with securing coverage for Hyperledger projects.

The day of the launch, marketing will issue the blog or press release publishing it over the wire (if need be) and on the Hyperledger website. We will spread the news on our newsletters and social channels: Twitter, and LinkedIn. We ask that the maintainers repost the news on their own social channels.
