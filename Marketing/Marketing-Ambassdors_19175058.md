# Marketing : Marketing Ambassdors

Created by Jessica Rampen on Sep 18, 2019

Weâ€™ve created a Marketing Ambassador Task Force to help us scale and achieve even more. The Marketing Committee Chairs will manage and oversee work completed by marketing ambassadors with help from Hyperledger staff. Plus aid in implementation. Two main roles for now are the Hyperledger Global Forum marketer and Developer Engagement officer. Learn more about each role and what is being asked [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/14IaN37W6Nw30oQRMLc3fdcSrSuNc3d9SeDKVZLpPZ_k/edit#slide=id.g60de648804_1_45). Apply by email [marketing@hyperledger.org](mailto:marketing@hyperledger.org).
