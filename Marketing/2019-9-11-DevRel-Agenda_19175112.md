# Marketing : 2019 9 11 DevRel Agenda

Created by Jessica Rampen, last modified on Dec 12, 2019

- How does Hyperledger approach marketing?
- Great need to create a space for marketing collateral/resources that is public. This would be to highlight services marketing can provide - content repository, processes around project launches, access to physical materials etc. Wiki?
- Developer engagement officer role - likely better as a group of folks than an individual. A lot of work for just one person. Maybe a WG?
- Community survey?
