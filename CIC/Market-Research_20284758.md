**Certified Kubernetes**:

- **Website**: [https://www.cncf.io/certification/software-conformance/](https://www.cncf.io/certification/software-conformance/)
- **Main repo**: [https://github.com/cncf/k8s-conformance](https://github.com/cncf/k8s-conformance) -- this is where they have participants in the program submit PRs with public records of their conformance testing results
- **Legal terms**: [https://github.com/cncf/k8s-conformance/blob/master/terms-conditions/Certified\_Kubernetes\_Terms.md](https://github.com/cncf/k8s-conformance/blob/master/terms-conditions/Certified_Kubernetes_Terms.md)
- **Participation form**: [https://github.com/cncf/k8s-conformance/blob/master/participation-form/Certified\_Kubernetes\_Form.md](https://github.com/cncf/k8s-conformance/blob/master/participation-form/Certified_Kubernetes_Form.md) -- the main way people sign this is via DocuSign, but they include an option for participants to sign and email PDFs
- **Visual Branding Guidelines**: [https://github.com/cncf/artwork/blob/master/projects/kubernetes/certified-kubernetes/certified-kubernetes-brand-guide.pdf](https://github.com/cncf/artwork/blob/master/projects/kubernetes/certified-kubernetes/certified-kubernetes-brand-guide.pdf) -- this is the document that says "use these colors, leave this much empty space between logos, etc."
- **Logos**: [https://github.com/cncf/artwork/tree/master/projects/kubernetes/certified-kubernetes](https://github.com/cncf/artwork/tree/master/projects/kubernetes/certified-kubernetes) -- they've done this in a way where there's a base part of the badge that doesn't change, and then additional portions at the bottom can be added for e.g. different release versions, or separate profiles with additional functionality, etc.

**OPNFV Verified / OPNFV Verification Program**:

- **Website**: [https://www.lfnetworking.org/OVP/](https://www.lfnetworking.org/OVP/)
- **Portals for participants**: [https://nfvi-verified.lfnetworking.org/](https://nfvi-verified.lfnetworking.org/) and [https://vnf-verified.lfnetworking.org/](https://vnf-verified.lfnetworking.org/) -- they've been reworking this into two separate programs
- **Legal terms**: [https://www.lfnetworking.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2019/03/2019-03-28-OVP-Terms-and-Conditions-Infrastructure-and-VNF.pdf](https://www.lfnetworking.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2019/03/2019-03-28-OVP-Terms-and-Conditions-Infrastructure-and-VNF.pdf)
- **Participation form** -- linked from the website, looks like they are also using DocuSign
- **Guidelines / process**: [https://www.opnfv.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2018/09/LFN\_CVP\_Guidelines-1.0.0.pdf](https://www.opnfv.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2018/09/LFN_CVP_Guidelines-1.0.0.pdf) -- this is a document the project put together to explain the conformance verification process
- **Workflow doc**: [https://opnfv-dovetail.readthedocs.io/en/latest/testing/user/certificationworkflow/index.html](https://opnfv-dovetail.readthedocs.io/en/latest/testing/user/certificationworkflow/index.html) -- I haven't reviewed this recently so I'm not certain offhand how it differs from the process document above
- **Visual Branding Guidelines**: [https://www.opnfv.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2018/05/OPNFV\_Verified\_BrandGuide\_021618.pdf](https://www.opnfv.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2018/05/OPNFV_Verified_BrandGuide_021618.pdf)

**ODPi Egeria Conformant**:

- **Website**: [https://www.odpi.org/projects/egeria/conformance](https://www.odpi.org/projects/egeria/conformance)
- **Legal terms**: [https://odpi.org/egeria-toc](https://odpi.org/egeria-toc)
- **Participation form**: [https://odpi.org/egeria-participationform](https://odpi.org/egeria-participationform)
- **Conformance software repo**: [https://github.com/odpi/egeria/tree/master/open-metadata-conformance-suite](https://github.com/odpi/egeria/tree/master/open-metadata-conformance-suite)
- I'm not sure whether they have a portal / public viewing for conformance results yet, this one is the newest of the three.

**Powered by OpenDaylight**: this one predates me and I wasn't involved with setting it up -- passing it along as reference for another process that was different from the ones above.

- **Website**: [https://www.opendaylight.org/ecosystem-solutions/find-a-solution](https://www.opendaylight.org/ecosystem-solutions/find-a-solution)
- **FAQ**: [https://www.opendaylight.org/ecosystem-solutions/for-solution-providers/powered-by-faq-page](https://www.opendaylight.org/ecosystem-solutions/for-solution-providers/powered-by-faq-page)
- **Registration form**: [https://www.opendaylight.org/ecosystem-solutions/for-solution-providers/powered-by-reg-form](https://www.opendaylight.org/ecosystem-solutions/for-solution-providers/powered-by-reg-form)
