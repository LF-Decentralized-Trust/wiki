Created by Sandy Aggarwal, last modified on Apr 18, 2022

### **1.  OVERVIEW**

#### **1.1 Introduction**

This study project aims to analyze and document the best practices, architectural framework and design patterns for applications of blockchain technology in the gaming space. Examples being, use of BaaS (Blockchain as a service), SSI (Self sovereign Identity) and blockchain agnostic frontends and backends. This project will be accomplished in three parts as below:

1\) Introduction to Blockchain Gaming

2\) Deep Dive into Use Cases of Blockchain Technology in Gaming

3\) Best Practices, Architectural Frameworks, Design Patterns and Tokenomics for Blockchain Gaming

#### **1.2 Scope**

The scope of this research paper is limited to researching the use cases, design principles and architectural standards of use blockchain technology in gaming space. This paper does NOT delve into details of so called "metaverse", which is still an undefined target state. Also, this paper is not intended to provide the standards or frameworks for games in general. 

#### **1.3 Timeline**

This research paper was started around Jan 23rd, 2022 and is planned to be completed in 3 parts as below:
