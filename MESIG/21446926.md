# Media and Entertainment SIG : MESIG-Gaming: Develop a Prototype Game

Created by Sandy Aggarwal, last modified on Apr 08, 2023

### **1.  OVERVIEW**

#### **1.1 Introduction**

This project aims to create prototype/MVP gaming apps which implement the best practices and standards documented as part of the research project.  As part of the Hyperledger mentorship project, a [project proposal](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=21954915) for design &amp; development of a mini-game was approved by the TOC. This page provides further details about this project. 

#### **1.2 Scope**

The scope of this project is limited to following two objectives:

1\) Creation of a mini game project that can be used by interested parties to study and extend design patterns for implementation of decentralized identity and payments in gaming space. 

2\) A three-part research paper with following parts:

a) Introduction to Identity &amp; Payments in Gaming (current landscape &amp; players, major platforms, limitations if any)

b) Deep Dive into Use Cases of Blockchain/Decentralized Technology in Gaming (for identity &amp; Payments)

c) Best Practices, Architectural Frameworks, Design Patterns and Governance for implementing decentralized identity &amp; payments in Gaming

#### **1.3 Timeline**

This project is estimated to run from June '23 to Nov '23. 

### **2. PROJECT DETAILS**

#### **2.1 Overview / Game Design**

This project will start with a basic game design which can be used to demonstrate concepts of identity, game moves and game assets (stored in different wallet types). This project will be divided into following phases:

1\) Game design ideation - on paper and using mockups 

2\) Explore options for integrate identity and payments (digital assets)

3\) Integrate other SDKs to incorporate features such as SSI, multi wallet support, multi and cross chain support

4\) Explore 3D games using game engines such as Unity and Unreal and integrate with game SDKs

#### **2.2 Game Development:**

The game development will consist of following aspects: 

1\) Create a simple game such as a basic marketplace experience or a casino gameplay to demonstrate concepts of identity, game moves and game assets (stored in different wallet types)

2\) Create one or more 3D games using game engines such as Unity and Unreal

3\) Integrate with game SDKs that provide utility &amp; payment functions

4\) Incorporate features such as SSI, multi wallet support, multi and cross chain support

#### **2.3 Research Paper**

The phase will consist of two parts: 

1\) Document current landscape for how identity and payments are incorporated in gaming space

2\) Document results and recommendations from the research game
