# Media and Entertainment SIG : 2023 HY1 Media and Entertainment

Created by Randy Givens, last modified on Dec 11, 2023

January - June 2023

**Bi-Annual Report**

Q1 &amp; Q2 Summary  

# **Overview**

### **MESIG is focused on applying Hyperledger (DLTs) to media and entertainment-specific scenarios. The topics covered include decentralized metadata, digital distribution, copyright protection, royalty payments, value chains, NFTs (non-fungible tokens), tokenized content, counterfeit reduction, registered digital ownership, metaverse, Web 3.0, and Artificial Intelligence (Ai) that will lead to real-world solutions for motion picture &amp; television directors, authors, audiovisual influencers, photographic publishers, gamers, music creators, and artists.**

## **MESIG progress Summary**

**MESIG RESTRUCTURE:** To increase participation in the MESIG monthly group, the subgroup structure was eliminated, and all events and activities of the subgroups were brought together under the Hyperledger Media &amp; Entertainment Special Interest Group. The Gaming Subgroup will retain the current project activities and previous documentation so users can follow the progress of game projects and events. 

Brett and Sandy will take on the role of Co-Chairs, each specializing in their respective fields of expertise. MESIG greatly benefits from Brett's extensive experience and knowledge in Hyperledger and blockchain entertainment. The Hyperledger Media &amp; Entertainment Special Interest Group is delighted to have Sandy Aggarwal as co-chair. As the MESIG Gaming subgroup leader and an active member of other Hyperledger Special Interest Groups, Sandy's experience will significantly benefit the entire MESIG membership. 

I will serve as the Assistant Chair for the Hyperledger Media &amp; Entertainment Special Interest Group. As Assistant Chair of the MESIG, I will assist Brett and Sandy with maintenance-related tasks, such as updating the wiki/discord pages and Hyperledger biannual reports.

**Hyperledger Project Mentorship Program**

MESIG is pleased to welcome Kyle Liu (aka @Flamebom) as a Hyperledger Project Mentorship Program mentee. Kyle is an incoming freshman at Georgia Tech, the 4th ranked university in the U.S. for computer science. He is a programmer and gamer with experience with Minecraft and other games. Kyle has the exact skills needed for this project. He will be working on this mini-game project under Sandy's guidance and conducting research for its design and structure. His passion for programming and gaming led him to participate in open-source development. Having Kyle working alongside Sandy on the Design/Development of a mini-game for exploring decentralized identity &amp; payments in gaming &amp; metaverse is a massive honor. A big congratulations to Sandy and Kyle!

**MESIG Projects:**  

**GAMING**

[**Design/Development of a mini-game for exploring decentralized identity &amp; payments in gaming &amp; metaverse**](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=21954915) 

This project aims to function as a proof-of-concept (POC) showcasing the use of decentralized identity and payment rails within the gaming sector and, eventually, the broader metaverse ecosystem. The specific objectives include:

Development of a mini-game POC demonstrating decentralized identity and payment systems with Hyperledger chains. Indy and Aries would be used for Identity, while Firefly would be utilized for digital assets. 

Research the current methods for identity and payments, exploring how Hyperledger blockchains can offer utility functions within these frameworks.

Investigation and development on how to incorporate digital wallets into the game project. These wallets would store credentials and digital assets following design principles and recommendations from the Open Wallet Foundation.

**MESIG Gaming Co-Chairman:** Sandy Aggarwal

In the monthly MESIG meetings, there will be a section dedicated to the discussion of gaming events and developments as part of the gaming meetings. This will allow everyone across subgroups to attend the central SIG meeting. We can have a one-off meeting if anyone wants a gaming group discussion on a particular topic.
