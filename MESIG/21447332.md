# Media and Entertainment SIG : MESIG - Film TV: KNODELEDGE

Created by Brett Russell, last modified on Jan 09, 2023

### **1.  OVERVIEW**

#### **1.1 Introduction to the KNODELEDGE Project**

K**NODE**LEDGE is a purpose built, private, permissioned, plug-n-play, enterprise business blockchain-in-a-box application for the **Film &amp; Television** industry.

The effects **blockchain,** **Web3, NFT's, DAO's,** and the **metaverse** have on the **media &amp; entertainment** industry cannot be overstated. K**NODE**LEDGE will leverage the ever expanding opportunities these nascent technologies offer entertainment industry participants and their fan base.

In particular, this project will (pardon this overused expression) *democratize* film &amp; television development and production allowing content creators of all sizes the ability to develop, fund, and distribute projects more efficiently, more equitably, and more profitably.

The innumerable and varied interactions between media &amp; entertainment industry project founders, their development and production teams, including agents, advisors, accountants, attorneys, funders, distributors, government agencies, et al, are perfectly suited to adapt to ledger technology. This allows blockchain, chaincode/smart contracts, and a host of on-chain and off-chain tools to disintermediate and more efficiently manage many of the pain points within the industry ecosystem automating workflow of key industry business processes.

Blockchain, Web3, NFT's, and DAO's hold great promise for participants in the media &amp; entertainment industry by lowering the barrier to entry and providing efficiencies through disintermediation, but the real success stories will be about "coopetition" a strategy K**NODE**LEDGE believes will be the great *disruptor*. The notion that emerging technologies will flip legacy Hollywood are unfounded, but it's no secret these new technologies are creating a more diverse and inclusive environment and opportunities abound like never before.

From the content creators to the producers, from the gaffers and grips to the cameramen, and from make-up artists to writers, building on K**NODE**LEDGE will unlock the potential for all participants to reap the rewards of a successful venture.

K**NODE**LEDGE will be built on Hyperledger Fabric with a view to interoperate with other **Hyperledger** projects, **WEB3**, **IPFS**, and current and future popular and secure blockchains. 

#### **1.2 Project Scope**

#### **The scope of this project encompasses the entire Film &amp; Television development, production, distribution, and consumer value-chain.**

The project will create opportunities that would otherwise be beyond reach of creators and their support teams.

**Friction Points:** At the start, and along the way, creators and industry participants are challenged. 

Barriers to Entry: 

Funding

Distribution

Technology

**Key Objectives:**

The aim of this project is to create a redeployable, plug n' play *blockchain-in-a-box* that film &amp; television production companies can use to quickly assemble a network of industry organizations who wish to privately and securely transact with each other.

With each member organization having already vetted and onboarded key and recurring organization participants (executives, accountants, attorneys, funders, directors, writers, cast, crew, other orgs, etc), the ability to spin up a new blockchain production entity using this established "circle of trust" becomes effortless.

The final objective of this project is to develop a PoC building an entire film/television production on the blockchain using K**NODE**LEDGE

**Planned Objectives:**

Identity Database, Verified Credentials (Industry Specific)

Alternate Funding Tools

Monetizable Asset Creation

Monetization of Intellectual Property Rights

NFT, Crypto Integration, Royalties/Residuals, Remuneration

Web3 Brand Development, Metaverse, Merchandise

Tokenization

Intellectual Property Licensing

Intellectual Property Transfer Agreements

Stakeholder Accessibility &amp; Transparency

New Media Distribution Channels 

Off-Chain Storage

Immutable Chain-of-Title

Legal smart-contracts (Boilerplate)

Fanbase - Immersive Web

    

**Deliverables:** 

Alternate funding methods

Monetizable assets

On-Chain IP Transfers

Payments - Residuals / Royalties

**Milestones:**

Alternate funding methods

Asset creation

IP Transfer

Licensing 

**Constraints and Exclusions:** 

Government Regulatory

Legal 

Entertainment Industry Guilds, Unions, Associations

#### **1.3 Project Timeline**

A timeline and roadmap will be announced after the Startup Team has convened.
