The purpose of this **New Member Center** is to provide a quick introduction for those interested in joining and contributing to the Hyperledger Media &amp; Entertainment Special Interest Group (MESIG) and subgroups. As a MESIG member, your participation and contribution add to the growing list of resources serving the membership.

**What does the Hyperledger MESIG do?**

Blockchain and distributed ledger technologies (DLT) offer significant potential to deliver benefits to those in the Media &amp; Entertainment industry.  These benefits include uniting disparate processes, increasing transparency, securing data provenance, etc. Blockchain/DLT promises to reduce costs and promote efficiencies that will benefit industry participants.

Our mission is to continually identify the individuals and organizations that currently develop, or wish to develop, blockchain/DLT technologies that integrate with, compliment, or completely replace industry processes, and introduce them to our membership with a goal to developing new fruitful relationships as well as opportunities.

**What do I need to do to be a Hyperledger MESIG member?**

It's as simple as registering for a free [Linux Foundation ID (LFID)](https://identity.linuxfoundation.org/). 

Hyperledger MESIG is an open and collaborative forum for like-minded individuals to work together to realize the full potential of blockchain/DLT technologies in Media &amp; Entertainment. The MESIG will document and foster technical and business-level conversations about emerging and untested applications for the industry.

**How can I get involved in the Hyperledger MESIG community?**
