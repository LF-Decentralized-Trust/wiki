**About the Event:** See [here](https://medium.com/cardstack/the-cardstack-ecosystem-73dc89aae2c8) for an overview of the Cardstack Ecosystem. 

[Cardstack](https://cardstack.com/) is an open source framework that [enables Web 3.0](https://medium.com/cardstack/rethinking-the-web-3-0-experience-9b5fe508aa77). “Cards” form the building blocks that allow for bringing in data from disparate sources, beautiful UI animations, encapsulated and flexible data schemas, and a quick ramp-up experience. Both JavaScript developers and end-users are empowered to add common application features (CMS, notifications, authentication) using the Card SDK.

Cardstack provides a full-stack development environment, meaning that it spans everything from the front-end browser experience, to API layers, to the database and caching. Under the hood, it makes use of other libraries such as [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/), [Ember.js](https://emberjs.com/), and [postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/), but someone does not need to know those tools in order to build something of their own using Cardstack.

At this event, Chris Tse offers an insight into the company's newest developments.
