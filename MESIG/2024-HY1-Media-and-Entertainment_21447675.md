**Discussion:**  
The second Blockchain AI Roundtable featured a dynamic panel of experts, including Brett Russell, Karen Kilroy, Ethan Kuehl, and Orson Weems. Our distinguished panelists discussed the following issues:   
What standards groups and agencies should participate in policymaking regarding the use of AI in the entertainment industry?  
Should the entertainment industry create a category for any film, TV, music, or streaming production that uses AI during development? Industry benefit or detriment?  
Blockchain; permissioned and public ledgers -&gt; Time Stamping, storing datasets, rights metadata, training data, content identifiers, digital fingerprinting, monetization - smart contracts.  
Training data used to produce new music, film &amp; TV videos, script writing, etc. Should it be protected? Regulated? Licensed?

On February 14, 2024, a press release announced the launch of File Baby, cofounded by Karen Kilroy (CEO), Orson Weems (President), Scott Harris (Share Holder), and Ethan Kueh (The Distinguished Architect). This groundbreaking platform tackles concerns about the authenticity and trackability of digital content in the fast-paced digital world. To address these issues, File Baby empowers professionals, including writers, artists, lawyers, inventors, filmmakers, students, and professors, to protect their digital intellectual property.

Leveraging standards established by the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA) and the Content Authenticity Initiative (CAI), File Baby is a turnkey platform that enables users to assert ownership, limit AI content consumption, and take control of their work. Notable organizations like Adobe, Microsoft, Google, and OpenAI are also members of C2PA and CAI, indicating the platform's credibility and recognition in the industry. Karen Kilroy, Orson Weems, and Ethan Kueh are also among the shareholders.

During the Blockchain Roundtable 2, Orson Weems highlighted the "Content Credentials" concept and its significance. As outlined in the discussion (listed below), Content Credentials are a form of metadata associated with various media formats, including images, audio, and video. They provide contextual information and enable transparent storytelling, facilitating attribution for creators and companies. Furthermore, Content Credentials empower consumers to make informed decisions based on trust and serve as a tool for organizations to safeguard their brand identity. The Content Authenticity Initiative concisely defines Content Credentials—special appreciation and gratitude to Orson Weems for providing the following outline in our chat.

   
According to the Content Authenticity Initiative, What Are Content Credentials?

A new kind of metadata for images, audio, and video (including streaming and live). This serves as a platform for genuine storytelling through transparency and gives creators and companies proper attribution for their content. It also enables consumers to make well-informed trust decisions and helps organizations safeguard their brands.
