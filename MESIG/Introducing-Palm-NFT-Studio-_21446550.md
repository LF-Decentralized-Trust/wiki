**About the Event:**

- Palm NFT Studio collaborates with creatives, artists, marketplaces, and rights holders to bring projects and platforms into the Palm ecosystem.
- The Palm ecosystem will ultimately be driven by a native token, $PALM, and is expected to be up to 99% more energy efficient than Proof of Work-based blockchain networks, providing artists a more sustainable solution today while Ethereum upgrades to Proof of Stake.
- Creators using the Palm ecosystem will benefit from super low gas fees, and the Palm ecosystem will reward both creators and participants.
- The Palm ecosystem was designed from the ground up to be as flexible as artists are creative. Today, we are making NFTs easier and more efficient to use with an Ethereum sidechain, and have a roadmap to decentralize over time.
