We welcome Kyle Smith as our MESIG Music Subgroup lead.

Kyle is a certified legal engineer by LexDAO. He is the Director of LexDAO clinic, a guild of over 100 crypto lawyers.  Having worked in corporate music publishing, Kyle's legal engineering interests are based on the challenges of informational due diligence in the area of supply chain provenance. His research conducted in that field led to a patent for his "hierarchical script database.". He knows that full-stack enterprise-grade solutions for the entire Web3 music industry are on their way, with both private and public layers. With that in mind, Kyle sees Hyperledger as having a bright future in Web3 music.  Kyle is looking forward to leading the Music subgroup of the Hyperledger Media &amp; Entertainment special interest group in creating a cross-pollination between private and public blockchains, furthering his passion for technology/blockchain-based musical rights management.

Working with Kyle as our MESIG Music Subgroup lead will be a pleasure.
