Main topics raised at first meeting (all are contained with the video [capture](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/MESIG/2021-02-09+MESIG+Call) of prior meeting. 

        1. Introduction to the ISCC: [https://iscc.codes](https://iscc.codes), ISCC Foundation: [https://iscc.foundation/](https://www.iscc.foundation). 

“The ISCC Foundation is an independent international nonprofit organization that promotes information technologies for the purpose of the common good. In particular the foundation supports and promotes the development and adoption of open standards and open source technologies as well as tools and services that enable individuals and organizations to better create, manage, discover, access, share, and monetize digital content, knowledge and ideas.”

2\. The application of ISCC technology to the DISTRI initiative: [https://www.academia.edu/44646056/DisTRi\_a\_Distributed\_Trusted\_Rights\_Framework\_for\_Digital\_Content](https://www.academia.edu/44646056/DisTRi_a_Distributed_Trusted_Rights_Framework_for_Digital_Content) 

“The authors assemble new, breakthrough technologies that focus on the fundamentals of rights management, namely content identifiers, stakeholder identifiers, metadata associations, authoritative assertions, and the use of trusted, multi-party, distributed, dynamic data management systems to create and share Rights Management Information. By providing trustworthy Rights Information, the provenance, authenticity, and compliance with agreements enable the automated distribution of content and associated rights compensation. The approach is minimally prescriptive but maximally supportive and inclusive. It allows many solutions to be used while enabling numerous ways in which individuals and organisations can cooperate in originating, enriching, governing, and distributing trusted Information, helping streamline current processes and trigger innovative businesses”

3\. Validity of music and NFTs

4\. Portability of any work done by the ME-SIG *away* from Hyperledger, should such transfer(s) ever be necessary.

**INTRODUCTION**  
—To the NFT landscape today   
[https://www.one37pm.com/grind/money/guide-to-nfts](https://www.one37pm.com/grind/money/guide-to-nfts)  
\- Includes this list

- [SuperRare](https://superrare.co/) — Highly-curated 1-of-1 edition NFTs. The “gold standard” in the current NFT space.
- [NiftyGateway](https://niftygateway.com/) — Fast-growing NFT market leading the pack in sales volume. Highly-sought after daily NFT drops, with popular visual artists and now celebrities getting involved. One of the few NFT platforms that accepts USD / credit card as payment.
- [Zora](https://zora.co/) — Feed-style NFT platform in which the market of each piece is baked into the NFT itself and not run by the platform. Zora therefore doesn’t take a transaction fee on each sale like the other platforms. Creating NFTs is currently invite-only. The Zora protocol is also open for anyone to build on.
- [Foundation](https://foundation.app/) — Beautifully designed and curated NFT marketplace with reserved bidding that, once met, unlocks 24-hour auctions. Creating NFTs is currently invite-only.
- [Rarible](https://rarible.com/) — The most open and permissionless NFT marketplace. Anyone can create an NFT right away without needing an invite, and a roadmap is in place to make the platform community-run.
- [Makersplace](https://makersplace.com/) — An invite-only creator NFT platform that accepts both Ethereum and fiat currency. Recently partnered with Christie’s auction house to sell the first fully digital piece at Christie’s, by artist Beeple.
- [KnownOrigin](https://knownorigin.io/) — Quality NFT art platform with multiple weekly drops. Offers accepted in ETH.
