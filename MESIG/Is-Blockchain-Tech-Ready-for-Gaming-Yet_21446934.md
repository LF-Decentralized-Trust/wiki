- Who: **Rafael Brown, CEO &amp; Co-Founder at Symbol Zero // Microsoft Regional Director**
- When:  **Thursday Feb 10, 2022 at 1PM Eastern (UTC -5)**
- What:  **Is blockchain technology ready for the gaming industry?**

Here's what you can you expect from this presentation by **Rafael Brown**.

*We've all heard of Metaverse's imminent arrival and various game platforms such as The Sandbox, Decentraland and Axie Infinity have been running in alpha/beta versions with the hope that the final product will be a truly immersive virtual environment, However, there are a multitude of issues such as high transactional cost (gas price), high energy usage, transactional latency, lack of interoperability between games, and  inability to transfer true ownership of assets (with context) that prevent blockchain technology to be fully ready for the prime time with MMO gameplay. Our guest speaker, Rafael Brown, takes us through a critique of these gaps and shines a bright light on core/architectural improvements needed to enable use of DLT in the gaming space.*
