# Media and Entertainment SIG : 2023 HY2 Media and Entertainment

Created by Randy Givens, last modified on Dec 11, 2023

July - December 2023

**Bi-Annual Report**

Q2 Summary 

 

# **Overview**

### MESIG is focused on applying Hyperledger (DLTs) to media and entertainment-specific scenarios. The topics covered include decentralized metadata, digital distribution, copyright protection, royalty payments, value chains, NFTs (non-fungible tokens), tokenized content, counterfeit reduction, registered digital ownership, metaverse, Web 3.0, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) that will lead to real-world solutions for motion picture &amp; television directors, authors, audiovisual influencers, photographic publishers, gamers, music creators, and artists.

# **MESIG progress Summary**

## **Hyperledger Project Mentorship Program:**

##### **This project plan outlines the development of a mini-game that will serve as a proof-of-concept for implementing decentralized identity and payment rails in the gaming ecosystem. The project will be completed in four phases, with deliverables at each phase. The final product will be a playable mini-game that demonstrates the use of decentralized identity and payment systems. A research paper will also be produced that documents current practices for identity and payments in gaming and recommends implementing digital wallets for storing credentials and digital assets.**

## **Blockchain/AI Roundtable:**

##### The entertainment industry faces several challenges in adopting artificial intelligence, and the roundtable aims to bring together a group of experts to identify and discuss these challenges. The participants will represent various industry sectors, including film production, entertainment law, copyright, intellectual property, accounting, blockchain development, gaming, content creators, writers, authors, agents, hair stylists, makeup artists, union reps, distribution, payments, payroll, streaming, marketing, and AI project managers. The roundtable aims to develop technological solutions to benefit those affected by these challenges.

**MESIG Projects:**  

**Gaming**

[**Design/Development of a mini game for exploring decentralized identity &amp; payments in gaming &amp; metaverse**](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=21954915) 

This project aims to function as a proof-of-concept (POC) showcasing decentralized identity and payment rails within the gaming sector and, eventually, the broader metaverse ecosystem. The specific objectives include the development of a mini-game POC demonstrating the use of decentralized identity and payment systems with Hyperledger chains. Indy and Aries would be used for Identity, while Firefly would be utilized for digital assets. 

Research on the current methods for identity and payments, exploring how Hyperledger blockchains can offer utility functions within these frameworks.

Investigation and development on how to incorporate digital wallets into the game project. These wallets would store credentials and digital assets following design principles and recommendations from the Open Wallet Foundation.

**MESIG Gaming Co-Chairman:** Sandy Aggarwal

In the monthly MESIG meetings, there will be a section dedicated to the discussion of gaming events and developments as part of the gaming meetings. This will allow everyone across subgroups to attend the central SIG meeting. We can have a one-off meeting if anyone wants a gaming group discussion on a particular topic.

**Issues and Challenges** 

While our monthly meetings are engaging, we need help to increase member attendance.  We hope that the MESIG restructure will positively impact member attendance.

**Participant Diversity**

Members were encouraged to add topic discussions to the monthly meeting agenda.  New attendees are always welcome. MESIG offers a safe environment for all members. The following Antitrust Policy and the Hyperledger Code of Conduct cover all Hyperledger meetings.
