Attendees:

Good discussion around different aspects of the definition of Semantic Interoperability.  The idea of a Policy of Interoperability was presented and what needs it would need to address including medical fraud as well as calculating interoperability.

During discussion Bob Coli referred to how CCD-A records provided an exchange format currently used to export/import patient medical information and offered to demonstrate his person CCD-A and how he felt it qualified as a format for storing data.  This presentation will be 10 minutes at the next meeting 2019.12.23.
