<!--THE END-->

- - Discussions in the group and Clinical Trials Process (CTP) definition underlined the multiple patient consent process
  - There is big interest in patient consent from different aspects, clinical trial, monitoring, EHR data integration and integration,
  - And Consent process is most appropriate to implement in Enterprise Blockchain due to accept and deny privacy, traceability and transparency reasons

<!--THE END-->

- Fabian and Paty had already discussion in the earlier meetings especially for Monitoring Projects, using medical data, for homecare solutions, telemedicine and similar functionalities. Both see many similarities and synergies between monitoring and CTP, with important difference, regulations in CTP.
- General discussion: Integration with a CTP Workflow is a great value, however End2End workflow is not really available.
- Fabian have been using the data and machine learning algorithms and the future of healthcare will be heavily influenced with the AI and Data Analysis.
- In Monitoring Fabian talked about the standard protocols, FHIR HL7. Deniz talked about the difficulties in FHIR implementation and simplified version of FHIR Argonaut. And Paty talked about her their version Smart on FHIR
