## Action items

- We explored how the net emissions tokens network could be used to trade carbon offsets and health data. We tried to add environmental health data tokens or carbon-backed NFTs as tokens to an offset dealer account in the Network shown in the video at https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/CASIG/Emissions+Tokens+Network and followed closely how the demo started with hardhat on a localhost. However, none of us had a wallet with Goerli test net tokens. And, the faucet requires signup or login with Alchemy to request any. So, we have to read the Terms of service and privacy policy before getting an alchemy account. And then we can get the goerli test tokens. And then we can try it at the next meeting.
