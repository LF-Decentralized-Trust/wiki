**![](attachments/20552275/20562963.jpg?height=400)**

- [Walter Montes](https://www.linkedin.com/in/waltermontes/), CEO of [WorldSibu](https://worldsibu.tech/), will be presenting on the work that he and his team are doing in the enterprise and open-source space with blockchain technologies tools development. Of particular interest to many Hyperledger Fabric developers, with the future of the [Hyperledger Composer project](https://github.com/hyperledger/composer) in question, what tools and workflows are available for quick solutions development? [WorldSibu's Convector product](https://worldsibu.tech/convector/) has taken up much of that slack, and Walter will speak to membership on this and other great products that can be used to make your blockchain technologies project a success.
