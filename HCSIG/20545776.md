## Healthcare-SIG Overall Health

The HC-SIG meetings are held every two weeks and we have an average of 3 attendees in each meeting in the second half of 2022. The attendance has dropped slightly since the first half of 2022. However, after adding the meeting videos to our [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0MZ85B_96CHQN9cscCdW-LZwp5GAoPrH), the Helathcare SIG playlist is averaging about 100 views per video. The General Meetings continue to focus on Industry Research and News in a Journal Club format.  

## Issues and Challenges

Meeting attendees are typically interested in the perspectives of other members and their opinions on industry news. However, there is a lack of unified purpose in the group, other than sharing research, articles, and discussion. Our three subgroups of Patient, Provider, and Interoperability have stopped meeting and are no longer active. There is still some interest in creating new ways to build community around these and other subgroups. 

## Overall Activity in the last 6 months

- Hosted 10 Healthcare SIG meetings and published to YouTube
- Discussed the impact of AI and OpenAI's Chat-GPT3 on healthcare
- Discussed the impact of Data breaches at hospitals and how DLT is poised to offer solutions

## Planned Work Products

- Review available healthcare/blockchain courses
- Identify interesting topics for guest presentations and set up events

## Participant Diversity

Participants in meetings come from a similar range of background in healthcare, mostly health technology veterans and people relatively new to the space trying to learn more about the Healthcare SIG as a resource for blockchain technology in health. There is generally an even number of females and males who have been attending meetings and mainly from the United States.
