## Healthcare-SIG Overall Health

The HC-SIG meetings were held every two weeks at the start of the year with less participants. Then the meetings were moved to every 3rd Wednesday of month at 3 pm GMT | 8.30 pm IST with guest presentations, and the participants count tremendously increased. June meeting count was 23. All meetings are recorded on our [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0MZ85B_96CHQN9cscCdW-LZwp5GAoPrH), and the Healthcare SIG playlist is averaging about 100+ views per video. [LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/company/hyperledger-healthcare-special-interest-group/about/?viewAsMember=true) too created and obtained 140 followers till now. The General Meetings continue to focus on collaborative Industry cum Academic Research for the betterment of the humankind.  

## Issues and Challenges

The Healthcare SIG which was completely inactive has started to slowly gain its momentum; keeping it up continuously is a challenge. Meeting attendees are typically interested in guest presentations on industry and research outcomes. Our three subgroups of Patient, Provider, and Interoperability have stopped meeting and are no longer active. There is still some interest in creating new ways to build community as the new members are mostly students and are interested in learning new things.
