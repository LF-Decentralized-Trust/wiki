  - Introduce yourself
  - Tell us where you're geographically located
  - Share with us your interests in healthcare in general, and blockchain technologies in specific

## **Community Announcements**

- **Feel free to share your community announcements as they relate to the Hyperledger community**

<!--THE END-->

> - Raveesh Dewan shared that Joget has produced a blog that provides instructions for drag and drop blockchain development so you can visually create an application—even if you don’t know how to code. He will send details to the HC-SIG by RocketChat.

## **HC-SIG Subgroup Updates**

- Patient/Member Subgroup (Benjamin Djidi, Lead)

<!--THE END-->

> - Rich provided an update on the donor milk project. The subgroup is still looking for a new subject matter expert.
> 
> <!--THE END-->

- Payer Subgroup (Raveesh Dewan, Lead)

<!--THE END-->

> - Raveesh provided an overview of the subgroup’s efforts. They are still working on a paper about payer opportunities. The paper will outline a decision framework, in general. It will provide decision points and a payer perspective.
> 
> <!--THE END-->

- Healthcare Interoperability Subgroup (Steven Elliott, Lead)

<!--THE END-->

> - The subgroup is still putting together a charter with a mission statement that will help to identify and define goals and directions. They want to place clinical artifacts on the blockchain in an interoperable way. The goal is to finish this weekend. First use case considered: vaccinations and credentialing.
> 
> <!--THE END-->
> 
> - Jonathan Holt added that IEEE Working Group is producing a great working framework that that will aid with vaccinations and credentialing. The framework is blockchain agnostic but will provide standards.
> - Jim Mason added that there is an MIT Blockchain White Paper that may add to Jonathan’s efforts: [https://hardjono.mit.edu/sites/default/files/documents/hardjono-lipton-pentland-p2pfisy-2018.pdf](https://hardjono.mit.edu/sites/default/files/documents/hardjono-lipton-pentland-p2pfisy-2018.pdf) and an EU GDPR paper [https://www.eublockchainforum.eu/sites/default/files/reports/report\_scalaibility\_06\_03\_2019.pdf](https://www.eublockchainforum.eu/sites/default/files/reports/report_scalaibility_06_03_2019.pdf)

## **HC-SIG Ad Hoc Team Updates**

- Wiki Redesign Team (Brian Ahier and Raveesh Dewan, Lead)
  
  - Work continues on our SIG site design

<!--THE END-->

> - Rich explained that documents are on Confluence and still transitioning. The goal is to synchronize with other working groups so that any member of a SIG can participate in more than one group without learning a new system.
> 
> <!--THE END-->

- Academic Research Team (Logan Wilding and Adrian Berg, Lead)
  
  - Logan plans to generate a one-page summary of next steps
  - Currently in works, [draft located here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1q-d8rGcRK2k_sq4xMUGinwhqwRYg-HOPK0vggaq7XkU)

<!--THE END-->

> - Rich explained they put together a paper several months ago that addresses peer reviewed resources. The process for vetting new technologies typically involves peer review. This team is trying to message a way forward to engage companies. Goal is to put forth a platform agnostic paper. The current draft is [located here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1q-d8rGcRK2k_sq4xMUGinwhqwRYg-HOPK0vggaq7XkU).

**Old Business**

- Getting Published? (Rich)
  
  - We have some extraordinary talent in our membership… let's put that to good use
  - Wiki page added [here](Article-and-Whitepaper-Research-Collaborations_20550639.html)

<!--THE END-->

> - There are over 1000 talented individuals that could contribute to papers. If anyone is interested in participating or collaborating in paper writing, they should sign up. Rich added that that health care organizations are academically-wedded and slow to accept new information. They seek objective, peer-reviewed information.
> 
> <!--THE END-->
> 
> - Wendy Charles shared her observations of current academic publications about blockchain.
> - Jim Mason described a project focused on Puerto Rico: a new university focused on certifying individuals with current version of Hyperledger Fabric. He added that it is focused on unique Hyperledger Fabric enterprise features.
> - Wiki page added [here](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/HCSIG/Article+and+Whitepaper+Collaborations).
> 
> <!--THE END-->

- Healthcare technologies challenges (Rich)
- - [KidneyX Redesign Dialysis Prize Competition](http://www.kidneyx.org/ "http://www.kidneyx.org/")
    
    - Aetna/CVSHealth submitted their proposal (Alan Bachmann)

<!--THE END-->

> - Congratulations to Alan and his team for submitting their Aetna/CVSHealth proposal to the KidneyX organization
> - Alan shared he is trying to determine patterns that can be scaled for enterprise use. He described the current manual—and often paper-based—processes that inhibit the process. He described efforts to use blockchain to share or access information. The overall goal is to improve kidney care. Rich added that chronic kidney disease affects 13% of population and is managed by CMS in a formal way that must be thoroughly documented. He described current treatments and efforts to improve efficiency using blockchain and integrate using digital identity methods.

## **New Business**

- Hyperledger Quarterly SIG Report due 04/15
  
  - Subgroup and team leads need to generate a summary of their work over this past quarter (Q12019)

<!--THE END-->

- > - A report is due to Hyperledger leadership by 04/15. Anyone who is a subgroup or team lead should contribute a one paragraph summary of work and status. Normally this report would focus on the past quarter, but Rich requested an update over the past six months.
