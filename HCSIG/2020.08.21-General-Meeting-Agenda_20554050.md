**![](attachments/20554050/20563434.jpg?height=400)**

- RESCHEDULED for 8/21: Sajith S.R., and the [Saintgits College of Engineering Team](https://saintgits.org/engineering-college/about-us/profile/), will discuss Medicalchain, a solution that uses blockchain technology to create a user-focused electronic health records whilst maintaining a single true version of the user’s data. Medicalchain enables the user to give healthcare professionals access to their personal health data. Medicalchain then records interactions with this data in an auditable, transparent, and secure way on Medicalchain’s distributed ledger.

## **General Meeting Notes**

**New Joiners:**

Rimo Binoy: Based in India, learning about blockchain tech

Jim Mason: From automotive space (supply chain) with some of the same issues overlapping with healthcare that can be applied to blockchain.

Prashant Khambekar: Philadelphia, PA, USA based. Works at Harbinger Solutions—one of his clients uses Hyperledger; product is patient ownership of healthcare records.

David Elmets: Works in financial services, trying to transition to Health Tech

Oliver Will: Works in healthcare; trying to learn about Blockchain

Indira Mysore: Global IT space. Worked for Roche, been in blockchain space for the past 2 years, part of NPO, working towards COVID credentials solution, ConsenSys health advisor.

**Presentation:**

SaintGits: MedChain, Medical Record Securance using Blockchain

**Questions/Zoom Comments:**

Indira Mysore:

Is there a. consortium backing this solution ? who are the sponsors in the healthcare industry ? (None)_ Are you targeting this solution for India ? **(Targeting many economic models)** what are the local regulatory impact from this model ? How do you manage medical images - storage , access , retrieval , security &amp; processing ?

Indira also wants to help with the project.

Jim Mason:

How is the project funded ??

How is data shared across the channel system ?? why ?? vs private data

**Data is hashed not stored on chain. Data is encrypted and stored off-chain using IPFS.**

How many hosting nodes?

Question - how will you support SSI with the Fabric solution?

**Is Fabric really the right platform? Discussion of Hyperledger Indy/Aries**

Jim Mason- Healthcare requires strong identity management control and credentialing for access etc. How does This solution address that identity management and credentialing to minimize PII risks etc?

Jonathan Holt:

Question: regarding the use of IPFS - aka “the permanent distributed web” and its role in storing healthcare data. How do you handle the control of the hashes? Encryption is not forever.

**Did an example with IPFS with his own hash. Does not really know technically how IPFS works.**

Mehul Shah:

I can help the Medchain team with technology

Prashant:

What is the size of a typical health record? What is the maximum size of one record that you have used? As Jim indicated, the channels is a very important consideration for sharing versus privacy.  If an MRI scan is part of the record, then the size of one record becomes huge!!

**Tested with dummy data—records needed to appended so data was becoming huge. Switched to IPFS—not sure how much data we can have.**

Kent Lau:

I recommend the free study resources provided by the Hyperledger Study Circle for learning more about Fabric and Sawtooth:

[https://www.meetup.com/Hyperledger-Sweden/events/trnrvrybclbdc/](https://www.meetup.com/Hyperledger-Sweden/events/trnrvrybclbdc/)

I also recommend looking at the payer subgroup repo:

[https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/modern-pharmacy-management/tree/master/MPM-fabric](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/modern-pharmacy-management/tree/master/MPM-fabric)

Oliver Will:

India might not have the need for such stringent credentialing as the US and Europe.

Brian B:

Not a question, just an observation, wanted to write to craft my response carefully) India's approach to national digital identity, Aadhaar, presents both a solution to a lot of the traditional identity &amp; patient matching issues that other health data sharing systems face, but also its own new set of concerns around privacy and consent. It's a different context they're coming from. However, it's worth asking how much more privacy-preserving and privacy-by-design can enter into these systems.

Johnathan Holt: Aadhaar: Federated Identity plus SSI—Verification process. Can anchor SSI into Aadhaar system?

Kent Lau: Been making platforms on Sawtooth and Fabric with HC-SIG patient and payor subgroups similar to presentation today. Regarding SSI—Instead of hardcoding ID onto the chaincode (Fabric smart contract) we give random number to match credentials on chain without sacrificing privacy.

Johnathan: That is more random. I have a physician number—most states require fingerprints and background check. To claim my number in an SSI or Aadhaar system—who is the issuer? Is there a cryptographic way to own this as a physician?

Raveesh: You don’t claim (credential), it is provided to you (issued). Provide documents to prove who you are. Similar risks exist.

Jonathan: Identity is a process of using identifiers to correlate metrics, including biometrics. Aadhaar system uses this as well. It is a process, not a given.

Raveesh: You claim by answering a bunch of questions—transactions that are recorded. Not that straightforward to “go and claim it”.

Raveesh: Pharmacy workflow management project. Would like to do a demo on this at the next meeting.

Mike: Canceling next meeting (Labor Day weekend) and will send more detailed surveys for what time we should meet. Coordinate with David Boswell on getting the meeting link out.
