# Healthcare SIG : HC-SIG - Payer Subgroup

Created by Raveesh Dewan, last modified by Elisabeth Green on Aug 18, 2023

# **Mission**

The mission of this group is to develop software related to payment for healthcare. Possibilities include a reliable way to identify the parties responsible for injury or illness and a safe way for them to transfer payment to the provider as the patient transfers a license to the provider to view her health data and the provider transfers to the patient a voucher for healthcare services or items including food on a prescribed diet.

# **Scope**

- The sharing of stories within and across membership boundaries: successes, failures, lessons learned, opportunities and challenges
- The education of both membership and the community on blockchain technologies, policies, and protocols as they relate to the healthcare industry
- The identification, development, and promotion of use cases, pilots, proofs of concept (POCs), proofs of value (POVs), and in certain cases, minimum viable products (MVPs) to educate and demonstrate the value of applicable blockchain technologies solutions in healthcare. Some examples of in-scope capability areas include, but are not limited to:
  
  - Streamlining the Payment Supply Chain in Payer Industry
  - Inter-operability solutions using distributed ledger technologies (DLT) to interconnect with datasets longitudinally across disparate healthcare systems
- The identification, documentation, and promotion of blockchain technologies solutions best practices, as applied in a healthcare payer industry
- The identification and promotion of conferences or related social networking opportunities (e.g., speaking engagements) to gain experiences outside of this Special Interest Group
