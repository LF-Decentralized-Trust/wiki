## **Unfinished Business**

- Since early March of this year, HC-SIG membership has focused on collaboratively identifying and sharing solutions as they relate to the COVID-19 virus pandemic. Special thanks to the many guest speakers who shared their solutions with HC-SIG members around the world. As this pandemic continues to present challenges to communities, states, provinces, and countries globally, we will provide ongoing support updates as they become available.
- *Again, to all who have helped... thank you!*

> Another excellent conversation that engaged Jonathan, Jim, Brian, and others around a number of topics including:
> 
> - ConsensysHealth's recent hackathon
>   
>   - ~500 teams participated
>   - Some excellent winning solutions
>     
>     - We hope to have these winning teams speak to HC-SIG membership
> - Contact tracing
>   
>   - Quite a bit of ongoing work around this topic
>   - Some questions/issues around end user trust in sharing data, and how best to do so such that people are engaged and participatory
>   - Future initiatives forthcoming
