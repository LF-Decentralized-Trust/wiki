## **HC-SIG Subgroup Updates**

- Patient/Member Subgroup (Deniz Coskun, Lead)

> We met in the last two weeks outside of the subgroup meetings, and continued with the use case definition.   
   
Decision to fix the scope :
> 
> - The use case will be on "Clinical Trials for a Diabetes Treatment with Wearables"
> - Patient Consent Process is the focus, for Site Selection, Patient Recruitment and Study Monitoring Processes
> - BRIDG Model reference for the Clinical Trials Data Model [https://bridgmodel.nci.nih.gov/about-bridg](https://bridgmodel.nci.nih.gov/about-bridg)
> - Smart on FHIR  [https://docs.smarthealthit.org/](https://docs.smarthealthit.org/)  as Data Standard for the Data Transfer between EHR2EDC
> - Separate Data Consolidation and Process Execution on Blockchain
> 
> Robert Learney and Alex Zhovnuvaty joined to team. Welcome!
> 
> I contacted to company [https://www.clinicalpipe.com/](https://www.clinicalpipe.com/)  
> 
> Open points:
> 
> - Patient Data GitHub for the Project is requested
> - Health Monitoring Process has many similarities Clinical Trials.
> - When is consent required more than once? For example: When a new PaaS AI supplier accesses the data? When during monitoring something new/different is monitored in the patient such as moods using a mood-tracking App? ( See [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5676196/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5676196/) )
> - How can we design the Hyperledger Consent API to be universally used in all cases? Standardization? 
>   
>   - API Structure is to be defined
> - Clinical trials use AI monitoring engine linked to a drug treatment plan?
> - What is the particular Treatment in Diabetes?
> - Which Framework is the best in Hyperledger? Fabric or Sawtooth? Criteria for the selection?
> - The data flow between Data and Process Layer
>
