Review Previous NotesSatarupa Bose

  Did not cover this due to low attendance

25min (Actual 15 mins)Discuss survey resultsAll

- Takeaway from survey results ([https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1-7RJLkIXE63AIIHo6l7edgX7-phd1zOzIe64yQkIzFs/viewanalytics](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1-7RJLkIXE63AIIHo6l7edgX7-phd1zOzIe64yQkIzFs/viewanalytics))
  
  Responses indicate more or less consensus on a comprehensive effort to delve into use cases that cover payor-provider-patient and generate detailed work products. Next logical step appears to be to get more detail on the work products elaborating on the last two questions in the survey. Vaibhav and Satarupa will collaborate on a enquiry style survey to get narrative responses.

- [**Link to the initial paper**](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1k8LDb5XuMoTDktQkB2PV0lXowjGws0ltco6QFpOvIAc)
- **Need clarifications on the following**
  
  1. What is the process for approval and publication of whitepaper by Hyperledger
  2. What are the constraints on contributing expertise (for those employed by payors) as well as usage of resulting IP (by all participants)
  3. Is there a plan to create a version of the whitepaper for the payor industry
