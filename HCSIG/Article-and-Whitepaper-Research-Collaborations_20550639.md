### Propose and Collaborate on Healthcare Technology Papers with Other HC-SIG Members

As our HC-SIG is fundamentally comprised of professionals in the healthcare and technology domains, and by definition, this SIG seeks to have an impact on those domains through the implementation of blockchain technologies, it's not too unusual to want to document and communicate your ideas within and across our respective communities.

This page should serve as a mechanism that permits someone with an idea--a thesis--for an article or whitepaper, and to promote it to other members who may be interested in collaborating. Put differently, this page is a crowd-sourcing effort to engage authors with similar, topical interests.

This is a purely voluntary effort, but if you're interested in posting your article/paper thesis, or adding your contact information to an existing thesis, here's what you need to do:

1. Log into the [HC-SIG Rocket.Chat channel](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/healthcare-sig "https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/healthcare-sig") (you'll need to create a Linux Foundation account)
2. Send a direct message to *richbl*, providing the following information:

**If you are proposing a new article/paper:**

- - An article/paper working title (required, a short temporary title to help gain interest from collaborators, e.g., "Blockchain Terminology")
  - An article/paper thesis (required, a short sentence stating your thesis, e.g., "In order for professionals to develop successful blockchain solutions, our technology terminologies must be consistent" )
  - Your name (required)
  - A social media URL to your name, but please don't publish your email address (required, e.g., Linkedin)

**If you are interested in becoming a collaborator on an existing article/paper:**

- - Your name (required)
  - A social media URL to your name, but please don't publish your email address (required, e.g., Linkedin)
  - The existing article/paper working title that you're interested in working on (required)

You'll receive an email confirming the addition of your name to the membership directory (usually within 24 hours). Please be sure to double-check your entry for accuracy.

**OR... feel free to edit this wiki page directly (please review the information above as it relates to table section definitions).** To do so, you'll need to log into this site using your Linux Foundation account.
