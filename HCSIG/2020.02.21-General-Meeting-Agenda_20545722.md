## **Community Announcements**

- **[2020 HC-SIG Membership Survey... extended until EOD today!](https://forms.gle/LVTAbrm2aadomwS19)**
  
  - While 2019 has been a very productive year within Hyperledger and our own HC-SIG, we're hoping to make 2020 a more engaging and educational year for everyone. With a very large and diverse international membership of healthcare professionals interested in identifying and using blockchain technologies in general, and the Hyperledger greenhouse of frameworks and tools in specific, I believe we have yet to tap the true potential of what we can do collectively to shape our global healthcare community.
    
    **To make full use of such great potential, we need your insight and guidance. [Please take some time now to participate in our 2020 HC-SIG Membership Survey](https://forms.gle/LVTAbrm2aadomwS19)**
  - Your input will set the direction for our 2020 membership year, so please consider this as critical to the ongoing growth and success of the HC-SIG.
  - **The survey will remain open until 2020.02.21 (EOD TODAY)**

## **Guest Presentation**

**![](attachments/20545722/20562927.jpg?height=400)**

- [Ben Parkison](https://www.linkedin.com/in/benparkison/), Director of Product Management at [Lumedic, Inc.,](https://lumedic.io/) a healthcare startup focused on revenue cycle management (RCM) solutions, and recently acquired by [Providence Health,](https://www.providence.org/en) will present to HC-SIG membership a self-sovereign identity (SSI) management solution live demonstration using [Hyperledger Indy](https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/hyperledger-indy) to permit patients to electronically update providers and payers with member details through secure digital wallet transactions. From Ben and his team:

> The development of decentralized identifiers (DIDs), a core component of digital self-sovereign identity (SSI) management, has created new opportunities for the efficient and secure exchange of information between entities in a number of different industries.
> 
> In healthcare specifically, DIDs and the concept of digital, verifiable credentials allow for a fundamentally new way of thinking about the patient financial experience. By allowing patients, providers, and payers to use digital credentialing to establish trust, patients can take control of their financial experience while allowing healthcare systems and insurance companies to eliminate processing overheads. Lumedic, a healthcare company focused on streamlining revenue cycle management (RCM), is using DIDs and digital credentials to create new technologies that allow payers and providers to focus on patients, not administration. Our Lumedic DID demo, using Hyperledger Indy, will illustrate the core concepts of DIDs and digital credentials as they relate to healthcare, and demonstrate how a common patient registration experience is transformed using these technologies.
