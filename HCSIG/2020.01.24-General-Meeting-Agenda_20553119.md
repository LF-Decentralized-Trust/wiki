## **New Business**

- **2020 HC-SIG Membership Survey is Live!**
  
  - While 2019 has been a very productive year within Hyperledger and our own HC-SIG, we're hoping to make 2020 a more engaging and educational year for everyone. With a very large and diverse international membership of healthcare professionals interested in identifying and using blockchain technologies in general, and the Hyperledger greenhouse of frameworks and tools in specific, I believe we have yet to tap the true potential of what we can do collectively to shape our global healthcare community.
    
    **To make full use of such great potential, we need your insight and guidance. [Please take some time now to participate in our 2020 HC-SIG Membership Survey](https://forms.gle/LVTAbrm2aadomwS19)**
  - Your input will set the direction for our 2020 membership year, so please consider this as critical to the ongoing growth and success of the HC-SIG.
  - **The survey will remain open until 2020.02.14**

<!--THE END-->
