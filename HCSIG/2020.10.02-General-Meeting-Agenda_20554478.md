  - Jonathan: pain points- authenticity and provenance of information sharing. using SHA/hash algos, sign data so other members can authorize information. decentralized public key infrastructure. key management systems (Octopus.sh?), key rotation, key recovery, how to distribute keys to verify information across semi-trusted partners
  - Indira: Jose Arrieta present on his HHS project
  - Jonathan: data retention laws within healthcare... what law can be maintained forever? required under these laws to maintain these technical infrastructures and architectures
