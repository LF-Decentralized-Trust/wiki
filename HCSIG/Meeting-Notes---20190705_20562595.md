**Notes - Clinical Trial Use Case discussion**

 

- Deniz presented slides for possible data and process architecture for the clinical trial execution
- First level of access is to find a site or hospital to carry out trial
- Hospital searches database for patients. Patient ID is blinded
- Then CRO (Contract Research Organization) negotiates with hospital to unblind patient’s data.
- Data Providers will need to know the system is protecting their value through a permission layer between CRO and Data Provider
- Data Providers are an agency or department working within a hospital, like John Hopkins.
- Interests/Needs of participants in a clinical trial

o  Hospital looking for researchers

o  Patient for treatments

o  Researchers look for data
