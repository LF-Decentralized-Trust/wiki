## **Abstract**

Medical Record Management System is an important information management system in healthcare centers and hospitals. Information kept in such  
systems need to be clean , correct and tamper-proof. In this paper, we take advantage of blockchains’ tamper-proof and decentralization properties to  
develop a robust and secure electronic medical record management system. In particular we choose HyperLedger Fabric as our underlying technical  
architecture. HyperLedger Fabric yields higher throughput and lower latency compared with other blockchains, which is a perfect candidate for  
enterprise software development. Our system is a novel innovation that can serve as an ideal replacement for conventional Medical Record  
Management System.
