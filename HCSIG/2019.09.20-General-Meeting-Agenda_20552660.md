- Assuring medical device safety and quality has become a huge global issues due to exploding volumes and complexity, the number of players involved in ensuring devices are safe and in good order, rising regulatory obligations, and poor transparency across supply chains and a specific asset's operating life, which may run as long as 10 years.
