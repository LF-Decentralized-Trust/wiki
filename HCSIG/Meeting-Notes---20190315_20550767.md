**Action Items:** 

1\. The format of the Intake form has been validated. Since the results of the form will be publicly accessible, we'll monitor reactions to the 'email' field and potentially remove it if members are not comfortable sharing their addresses in the public domain.

2\. The Request for Information expires today. We'll check with the broader Healthcare SIG whether anyone intends to Comment and, if timing allows we'll Comment else we'll reach out directly to the National Science Foundation to scope whether there is potential to work together.

3\. The lead list is now available online. This is a collaborative document where we can review individual projects and mark links as qualified or not: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AWhCfxynCqzYmtrm48Q5iiJqPq4Yq3l-4YPlxZ39l0g/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AWhCfxynCqzYmtrm48Q5iiJqPq4Yq3l-4YPlxZ39l0g/edit?usp=sharing)
