# Healthcare SIG : Meeting Notes - 20190802

Created by P B, last modified by Deniz Coskun on Aug 22, 2019

## **Recordings [Hyperledger HC Patient 20190802.m3u](#)**

## **Clinical Trial Use Case**

**In attendance:**

- Deniz Coskun (Moderator)
- Anil Srikantiah
- Kent Lau
- Paty Buendia
- Michael Dillhyon

 **Notes**

- Deniz presents slides and patient recruitment process flow table.
- Kent presented his graph with view of user interactions with UI, blockchain, analytics, and IoT data (sensors/wearables).

 

**Should hashing happen in the smartphone?**

Michael Dillhyon: Sensors should be separate from where processing is happening. Sensor attached to wearables, they have storage and processing capabilities. There is a gateway involved, any non-invasive device has a gateway. Here is where the hashing could occur.

Kent Lau: A lot of Ethereum factors in the graph, because it is based on work that hashes in the sensor and works with Ethereum.

**How can we all benefit from this project?**

Deniz: How we can define a scope with the mutual benefits of the team members and push the standardization with the Hyperledger Frameworks and tools? This will be great motivation to sustain the participation and deliver for the group.

Paty: Patient consent is important for biomedical research and to study data from IoT. Briefly discussed a 2017 paper titled “Blockchain protocols in clinical trials: Transparency and traceability of consent”

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5676196/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5676196/)

 There are many situations in which patient re-consent must be sought or patients should be notified of trial minor issues, such as new risks, significant changes in the research procedures, and worsening of the medical condition. Documents that are to be sent to patients can be consent-form addendums, an information letter or a fully revised consent form

**Should consent be the focus?**

Kent Lau: The consent question is at the heart of the Clinical Case use case.

Michael Dillhyon: The consent piece is key...to offer as a service layer

Kent Lau: Private datasets supported by Fabric. Write and standardized the smart contracts for consent. Anytime someone access the data, patient needs to get consent. If something new is proposed, patient needs to consent.

Deniz: Blockchain Architecture is ideal for Patient Consent and Multiple-Consent as use case in Clinical Trials. 

## **Project Scope and Requirements**

**Can consent be implemented with Indy?**

Anil Srikantiah: Credential can be given or revoked. 

Paty: See Indy section in [Evaluation of Privacy and Confidentiality in Hyperledger Platforms](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14paUx8CC_lWV01TMHNmeu3NGxtxb5rgtipyMr3vrR8w/edit#heading=h.8iu7mpmqfjq)

**For next meeting:**

Deniz: If we take patient consent as the focus of the use case, what are the next steps?

Anil will present in 2 weeks visual display of the BRIDG model Hyperledger solution he is building

We will meet outside of the usual Hyperledger meetings
