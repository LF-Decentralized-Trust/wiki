## Online Discussion (from RocketChat this week)

## This Week's Discussion:

- Update from the implementation team
  
  - Implementation Plan: [https://hackmd.io/@dbluhm/did-indy-impl](https://hackmd.io/@dbluhm/did-indy-impl)
    
    - Is there a better place for this document?
    - DID Doc support is well defined
    - Investigation into required changes for resolving AnonCreds objects is ongoing
- [GitHub PRs](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-did-method/pulls) for review
- [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-did-method/issues) for review
- Leftover from the last meeting (a long time ago...)
  
  - **DECISION NEEDED**: Schema on NetworkB, Claim\_Def on NetworkB; NetworkA goes away. Can a holder proof/verify from a credential?
    
    - For implementers to determine:
      
      - What would it mean to not have the schema on the same ledger?  Is that easy to do?
      - Possible solution: Have endorsers require that they verify the schema on another ledger exists.
      - [Daniel Bluhm](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/712020:c322d585-d6d2-4479-a990-b91fac45db1c?ref=confluence)and team to review and come back with a decision.
    - Previous discussion:
      
      - Possible: Put a reference on NetworkB to schema on NetworkA
      - Idea: I[nter Blockchain Communication Protocol](https://ibcprotocol.org/) (IBC Protocol) - genesis transaction from NetA on NetB, when write reference to Schema from A to B, can include state proof
        
        - NetworkB becomes a client of NetworkA
        - CLAIM\_DEF MUST reference the local instance of the SCHEMA
        - Extend definition of SCHEMA to include an optional reference to the original schema (DID URL and state proof from other ledgers)
      - Idea: Put this as future work?  Put this in as a consideration for issuers.
        
        - Don't allow for now – future work to enable cross-ledger references
        - Allow but do no extra checking – future work to constrain
      - Idea: Don't allow Claim\_Def to reference object on another ledger – schema MUST be on the same ledger.
    - Options:
      
      - Do nothing, allow this and ignore the "network can go away" issue.
      - Do nothing, don't allow this.
      - Don't allow, but allow some way to have a local copy of the schema.
- To Do:
  
  - How far to take a DID Resolver in indy-vdr
  - Create an Indy HIPE that points to the spec.
  - Define the backlog of tasks:
    
    - indy-node
    - indy-plenum
    - indy-vdr
    - universal resolver image
