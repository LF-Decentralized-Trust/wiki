# Hyperledger Indy : Indy SDK Wishlist

Created by Richard Esplin on Feb 25, 2019

## Indy Agent Connect-a-thon 2019-02-22

N-wise relationship support

- APIs should support N parties as peers even if N=2 for now
- Need cryptography to avoid correlation

DID Doc support

- Fully qualified DIDs needed first
- All functions that take a DID as an argument should tolerate taking a DID with a predefined prefix.
- Down the road: pluggable DID resolvers.
- Multiple key support
- Review the Sovrin DID spec to ensure it has the right language around limitations relative to other DID methods (biometrics discouraged from DID documents).

Non-Sovrin Verifiable Credentials

- At least provide placeholders for Envoy contributors
- Alternate representations of a credential (Web AuthN)

Message Trust Context

- Messages should contain indicators to signal how much trust should be given to the message
- - Did it arrive encrypted?
  - User configuration for a default trust level that will trigger warnings or rejection.

Wallet deletion

- Keys (and other items) that are no longer needed
- Storing thread-state or protocol state in a generalized way in the wallet

Key to DID lookup

- Current approaches are not efficient: tags, reverse lookups

Loading the in-memory wallet:

- for unit test
- development

Encryption:

- Pluggable cypher suites with the wallet
- HSM / TPM support

CI / CD wishlist:

- WASM build as an official output with CI / CD
- - Blocked by LibZMQ dependency
- CI tests run on Arm
- Currently tests to reduce the time needed
- IOS dependencies outside LibIndy should be built into it, similar to Android builds

Platform updates:

- Newest version of LibSodium
- - Or document why we can’t change it.
- Improvements for Python 3.7

<!--THE END-->

- Can use features today that are backwards compatible to Python 3.5

Wrapper wishlist:

- Simple wrappers for integration tests (easy to maintain across languages)
- “Phat Rappers” Fat wrappers for easy developer usage (language idiomatic language libraries) differentiated from thin language wrappers

Agents in the SDK

- Wallet for a static agent (read-only storage for the wallet layer)
- CLI Agent (Spencer’s cookie jar demo)

Schema 2.0 / W3C VC

- DIF Credential Manifest
- Encoding improvements
- - More encoding types in the SDK
  - Encoding extension mechanism

Integrating Ursa

- Increased predicate support
- Credential aggregation
- Credential chaining
- M of N issued credentials

Delegatable credentials

- Data custody (GDPR)
- Rental agreements (delegates authorization)

Credential verification improvements

- Partial proving (date of revocation)
- Proving to a group of people
- Generate both repudiable and non-repudiable proofs

Agent Authorization Policy
