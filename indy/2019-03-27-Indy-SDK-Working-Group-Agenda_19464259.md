# Hyperledger Indy : 2019-03-27 Indy SDK Working Group Agenda

Created by Richard Esplin, last modified on Apr 25, 2019

Attendees:

- Richard Esplin
- Matt Raffel
- Stephen Curran
- Douglas Wightman
- Sam Curren

Release Status:

- 1.8.2 bug fix release in March
- 2.0 architecture proposal is underway, but no timeline for the release yet
- - Need to share proposal for 2.0 with Hyperledger TSC when it is ready.

Open PRs:

- No concerns

Business:

- Progress on a Python "fat" idiomatic wrapper (repository, maintainership, governance, relationship to the thin wrapper, etc.)
  
  - Repository name: indy-sdk-python, (indy-sdk-dotnet, indy-sdk-nodejs).
  - Link to the "idiomatic library" in the Indy SDK as the default wrapper, and provide a secondary link to the "low-level wrapper".
  - Allow idiomatic libraries to create SDK "future" features that can later move into LibIndy.
    
    - People that don't know Rust can contribute an idea in the wrapper, and we can move it to the low level.
  - Testing in the idiomatic library is of the library/wrapper, not of the underlying SDK. (LibVCX has a test mode that mocks the external responses.)
    
    - The low-level wrappers is for testing the underlying SDK.
    - We want to just test the library/wrapper layer without repeating the tests in the lower layers.
  - Autogenerate "low-level wrappers"?
    
    - Evernym likes the idea, but it isn't an immediate priority. We would appreciate a volunteer doing the work.
    - The current wrappers are not much work to maintain.
    - Concerns with updating the test code.
    - Previous thinking: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wvFG35-27\_glUZ19CLQ7SrRwKQwE2Fbg4ocaH7-vaw4/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wvFG35-27_glUZ19CLQ7SrRwKQwE2Fbg4ocaH7-vaw4/edit)
- Document of IndySDK 2.0 arch: [https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/pull/1546](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/pull/1546)
- Anoncreds 1.0 HIPE: [https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-hipe/pull/109](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-hipe/pull/109)
- Credential exchange HIPE: [https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-hipe/pull/89](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-hipe/pull/89)
  
  - 0.1.0 proposal for minimal credential exchange for short-term demos: [https://hackmd.io/s/HkklVzww4](https://hackmd.io/s/HkklVzww4)
    
    - Won't be a HIPE. Only useful for people targeting a demo at IIW.

Future Topics:

- Standards for payments as part of credential exchange and direct transfers in an Indy ecosystem
- Changes to CI / CD
