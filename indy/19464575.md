## Online Discussion (from Discord this week)

## This Week's Discussion:

- Update from the implementation team
  
  - Implementation Plan: [https://hackmd.io/@dbluhm/did-indy-impl](https://hackmd.io/@dbluhm/did-indy-impl)
  - feature/self-cert merged into main feature branch
    
    - Investigation into TXN\_PAYLOAD\_VERSION: [https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-did-method/issues/63](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-did-method/issues/63)
  - Draft PR opened: [https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/pull/1740](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/pull/1740)
    
    - Tests passing ![(smile)](images/icons/emoticons/smile.png)
  - Working on HIPE and Doc updates
  - This week:
    
    - ATTRIB txn resolve state by seqNo or timestamp
    - Finish off HIPE, doc updates
    - Polishing up
- Indy VDR updates
  
  - Indy VDR Proxy server with multi-ledger and DID Resolution support: PR [https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-vdr/pull/86](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-vdr/pull/86)
    
    - Static network configuration by did indy networks repo or local folder structure
  - Indy VDR Python Wrapper with general DID Resolver. PR: [https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-vdr/pull/87](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-vdr/pull/87)
    
    - Example of static and dynamic network configuration. Dynamic tries to fetch genesis txn from did indy networks repo when new DID namespace is encountered.
    - Resolver used in wrappers can't fetch ATTRIB txn if no diddocContent is present. Wrapper code has to take care of that.
  - DID:Indy Universal Resolver Driver based on new Indy VDR: [https://github.com/IDunion/indy-did-resolver/tree/did-indy-vdr](https://github.com/IDunion/indy-did-resolver/tree/did-indy-vdr)
  - DID generation in indy vdr tests via indy-utils (part of indy-shared-rs). PR to enable generation of did:indy self-certified DIDs: [https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-shared-rs/pull/13](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-shared-rs/pull/13)
- PR review and finalization.
- **Question**: Will we be able to put \`did:indy\` references into objects shared amongst participants and they "just work"
  
  - For example, in a proof request, can I put into the restricts \`"cred\_def\_id" : "did:indy:123...345:...."\` and it will work with Indy VDR?
  - Presumably not – what has to change to enable that?
- [GitHub PRs](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-did-method/pulls) for review
  
  - [Self-certification validation selection update](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-did-method/pull/60)
  - (Draft) [Resolvable JSON-LD DID Doc Examples](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-did-method/pull/55)  - Moved to Sam Curren for further review and research.
- [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-did-method/issues) for review
  
  - [Indy object naming conventions permit whitespace and other characters that impact formatting as a URL](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-did-method/issues/59)
- Next Week:
  
  - Governance of the Hyperledger \`did-indy-networks\` repo, and deployment
  - Changes needed to CredX, indy-sdk/anoncreds and ACA-Py (and other frameworks) to use DID:Indy identifiers.
