- Indy consists of multiple code repositories hosted at [Hyperledger's GitHub](https://github.com/hyperledger). Each repository has:
  
  - A README.md with important information for getting started.
  - A docs folder, which is published to [Indy.ReadTheDocs.io](https://indy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) as the official documentation.
  - A design folder, which contains additional architecture information.
- Project specific standards are proposed as [Hyperledger Indy Project Enhancements (HIPEs)](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-hipe/).
- You should also read [How to Contribute](How-to-Contribute_19464766.html)
