# Hyperledger Indy : Tips on How to Run Meetings

Created by Stephen Curran, last modified on Nov 10, 2022

# Before

- Line up topics and people to lead discussions about the topics
  
  - Keep an eye on Discord for potential topics
  - Keep an eye on the activities in the repos
  - What are the hot topics in the community
  - Are there any "Future Topics" from the past meetings
- Friday before the meeting – copy and edit the previous meeting agenda
  
  - Exclude attachments in copy
  - Update the date, remove the old recording, add in the Zoom link, remove past meeting attendees
  - Remove no longer relevant material
  - Update all of the content from the last meeting
    
    - If details were collected in the last meeting for an item to be discussed again, remove the details in anticipation of new details
  - If Action Items were defined in the last meeting, see if it is appropriate to include them in this meeting (contact assignee)
  - Add links were useful to the content to be discussed – e.g. to specific issues, pull requests, presentations, etc.
- Day before the meeting:
  
  - Post on the appropriate channel(s) in Discord a note about the meeting
  - Review the Meeting Agenda to make sure it is up to date and ready
- A good idea is to set calendar entries to remember to do the "Friday before" and "Day before" tasks

# During

- Open up the agenda in your browser, ready to share, plus any other pages needed.
- Join the meeting, greet people, claim host (click on participants, button bottom of the screen)
- Share your screen
- Start the recording
  
  - I usually record locally and upload the recording after the meeting, but others record to cloud
  - Ideal: Capture the recording start time, and times of key events so you can provide the recording timestamps of when discussions start
- Intro for the recording, go through the page (summary of agenda, anti-trust notice, code of conduct, welcome, intro)
- Topics - where possible, take notes on the meeting agenda page as you go – or on paper to update the meeting page after the meeting

# After

- If recording locally, rename recording the "YYYYMMDD - &lt;Name of Meeting&gt; Call Recording.mp4" or something similar
- Drop recording on page and change into a link
- Check the "chat" and see if there is anything there that should be added to the meeting agenda page
  
  - Perhaps as a list of chat message under the recording
  - Perhaps by the relevant agenda items
- Update the notes made of the meeting
- Document any to dos for others at the meeting
- Note any "Future Topics" that came up in the meeting
- As appropriate,
- Remember to click "Update" ![(smile)](images/icons/emoticons/smile.png) on the page
