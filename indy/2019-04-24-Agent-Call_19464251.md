# Hyperledger Indy : 2019-04-24 Agent Call

Created by Sam Curren, last modified by Richard Esplin on May 01, 2019

## Summary:

Covered updates to the credential exchange HIPE, including the format of attachments, credential format separation of concerns, etc. [Comment](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-hipe/pull/89#issuecomment-486850367) added to the Pull Request summarizing the conversation.

Went over a first cut at what a payments decorator might look like and explored some expectations about what payments are and how they might be handled at the messaging layer.

A proposal was presented for reaching concensus on an important component of the Peer DID Method Spec - whether the DID string should be a UUID derived from the initial verkey of the DID's associated key pair.

No meeting next week due to IIW.
