# Hyperledger Indy : 2019-04-24 Indy SDK Working Group Agenda

Created by Richard Esplin, last modified on Apr 25, 2019

## Summary:

Useful work updates. Lots of volunteers to push forward projects like the HIPE for payment decorators, migration to Ursa, PR reviews, GitLab migration, language specific libraries, and static code analysis.

## Remember:

- [Linux Foundation Anti-Trust Policy](2019-04-24-Indy-SDK-Working-Group-Agenda_19464267.html)
- [Code of Conduct](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/events/pages/21791172/Diversity+and+Code+of+Conduct)

## Attendees:

- Sergey Minaev, Evernym
- Stephen Curran, Cloud Compass/BC Gov
- Sam Curren, Sovrin
- Thomas Shelton, CU Ledger
- Steve McCowan
- Mike Lodder, Sovrin Foundation
- Richard Esplin, Evernym

## Release Status:

- April: Indy SDK 1.8.3
  
  - Bug fixes for auth\_rules
- May: Indy SDK 1.9.0
  
  - Transaction Author Agreement API
  - Wallet Entities Deletion

# Work Updates:

- Language specific libraries: some repos now exist, but we need more maintainers
- GitLab migration
  
  - Sergey shared a set of challenging use cases with Mike that we need help with.
    
    - Jenkins pipeline configures docker instance within the pipeline. GitLab would need to store the images which will take too much space.
    - How to do mobile builds and testing: hardware versus software emulators.
  - Will migrate indy-sdk after migrating LibSovToken.
  - We don't currently use any orchestration, so no need to migrate to K8s
    
    - Most complicated step is the Windows SDK where it tests against a slave pool
- SDK 2.0 architecture
- Credentials Exchange Hype
  
  - Updates to main PR: [https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-hipe/pull/89](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-hipe/pull/89)
    
    - Ready to push for acceptance in #indy-maintainers? (Instead of waiting for the next meeting.)
    - Before acceptance, need to process the feedback from the Indy Agent call.
  - Sergey's draft of payments as part of credential exchange: [https://github.com/KitHat/indy-hipe/pull/1](https://github.com/KitHat/indy-hipe/pull/1)
    
    - Sam's draft:  [https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-hipe/pull/129](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-hipe/pull/129)
    - Should be a separate HIPE because the payment decorator could apply to any message family (though it can be a required part of the protocol)
    - Payment section of VCX HIPE should refer to "decorators as documented in a different HIPE", and clarify which messages use the decorator.

# Other Open PRs:

- PR 1578: Ursa PR has been reviewed 3 people now. Our goal is to get this merged in May.
- [PR 1581](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/pull/1581): Ian reviewed, and changes are needed. Should be marked WIP.
- [PR 1587](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/pull/1587): Verify proof request restrictions
- [PR 1454](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/pull/1454): Ready to merge design for cached credentials for offline proofs. Interested people should review it and add final comments.
- Plans for older pull requests: either need to finish them or reject them.

# Other Business:

- Language specific libraries:
  
  - indy-sdk-python: Sam Curren
  - indy-sdk-ruby: John Callahan
  - indy-sdk-go: someone needs to invite the person who submitted the PRs (Stephen Ephraim or someone from SecureKey?)
  - indy-sdk-ios: Norm is willing, but someone else will understand IOS development better (especially with Swift).
    
    - Need to resolve how indy-sdk-ios relates to libvcx
    - rejected the approach of separate repos for indy-sdk-swift + indy-sdk-objectivec
  - indy-sdk-java: Thomas Shelton
    
    - Need to resolve how Java wrapper relates to libvx
    - Need a separate repo and maintainer for indy-sdk-android
  - indy-sdk-dotnet: Tomislav?
    
    - Can also produce Android and IOS
- Dealing with warnings from rust cargo clippy
  
  - Mike will do the initial review, then escalate concerns to this group.
  - Ignore a line? #!\[deny(clippy::all)]
    
    - Ursa found that it prevented compilation in some cases
  - What data analysis do we want to do with the output?
  - Should we recommend pylint on Node / Plenum?
