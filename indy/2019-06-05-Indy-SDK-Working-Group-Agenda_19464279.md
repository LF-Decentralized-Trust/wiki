  - Wallet Entities Deletion (BC.gov)
    
    [https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/pull/1588](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/pull/1588)
    
    - Need to be added to the language wrappers
  - Cached credentials / offline proofs (Evernym)
- June: Indy SDK 1.10.0
  
  - Flexible Credential Attribute Tagging ([BC.gov](http://BC.gov))
  - Bugfixes
  - GitLab migration alongside Jenkins (Foundation)?
    
    - Linux should be ready, maybe Windows.
    - Need a plan for mobile devices.
    - Could run it right after the release.
- July / August:
  
  - Platform Updates (Evernym?)
  - Aries / Indy split (Evernym will help with architecture)
  - Anoncreds 2.0 (Sovrin Foundation, BC.gov?)
  - Other:
    
    - DID Doc / Fully Qualified DIDs / DID Resolution (Evernym?)
    - W3C Verifiable Credentials (Evernym)

# Work Updates:

- Aries language specific libraries and #aries-sdk chat channel (Nathan)
  
  - Repos are created, but still need to create chat channel
- GitLab migration (Mike and Steve G)
- SDK 2.0 architecture (Sergey)
- HIPEs (Sergey)
  
  - Credentials Exchange HIPE
    
    - Stephen moved to Aries-RFC
  - Payment decorator

  - IS-1270 through IS-1274
  - Will look at again in July
- Rust support for iOS bitcode (Steve M)
  
  - Error rendering macro 'jira' : null
  - Recompiling Rust didn't help. IOS raised the size limit, so we can wait a bit. Mozilla is pushing for a solution.
  - Update with findings, and close as deferred?
- New design for revocation / Anoncreds 2.0 (Mike)
  
  - Would be useful to have a comparison in performance between Anoncreds 1.0 and Anoncreds 2.0
