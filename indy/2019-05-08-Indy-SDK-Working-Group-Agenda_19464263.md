# Work Updates:

- Language specific libraries:
  
  - indy-sdk-python: Sam Curren (telegramsam)
  - indy-sdk-ruby: John Callahan (johncallahan)
  - indy-sdk-go: Arjen Van Eersel (arjanvaneersel)
  - indy-sdk-ios: Norm (nsivraj) is willing, but someone else will understand IOS development better (especially with Swift).
  - indy-sdk-java: Thomas Shelton (twshelton)
  - indy-sdk-android: Mike Lodder (mikelodder7) is willing, but someone else with more interest could take it over
  - indy-sdk-dotnet: Tomislav Markovski (tmarkovski)
  - indy-sdk-javascript: Joe Genereux (thedolie)
- GitLab migration
  
  - Will migrate indy-sdk after migrating LibSovToken.
  - 1\) publish the proposal to community, discuss it
    
    2) implement CI and run it in parallel with current version as optional
    
    3) implement CD and target file publishing to the temporary location
    
    4) swap GL CI and Jenkins: make GL required, Jenkins optional
    
    5) disable Jenkins CD, target GL to actual artifacts location
    
    6) disable Jenkins CI
- SDK 2.0 architecture (Sergey)
  
  - Need to resolve how libvcx relates to language specific libraries
  - [https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/pull/1546](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/pull/1546)
  - Will re-visit the proposed design in June
- HIPEs (Sergey)
  
  - Credentials Exchange HIPE
  - Payment decorator
- Warnings from rust cargo clippy (Mike)
  
  - Initial evaluation completed
  - Started fixing common errors
    
    - Using types instead of passing lots of parameters
  - Some of the suggestions break compilation
- New design for revocation: (Mike)
  
  - Working on the paper
  - Actively building prototypes
  - Ledger changes will be required, so it will take months to have a usable implementation on the Sovrin network

# Other Open PRs:

- Plans for older pull requests: either need to finish them or reject them.

# Other Business:

- The future of Daniel Bluhm / Joe G’s Indy Typescript Lib for pack / unpack
  
  [https://github.com/thedolie/indy-pack-unpack](https://github.com/thedolie/indy-pack-unpack)
  
  - Samples folder of the SDK
- indy-sdk-javascript
  
  - Supports JavaScript on both the server-side and in the browser
  - Same repo publishes a NodeJS artifact to NPM
  - Also includes TypeScript pack / unpack
  - How does it relate to WASM efforts? 
    
    - WASM is 3-5x faster than TypeScript
    - Should have both.
    - WASM components should be built from the language idiomatic library for the source language
  - Also needs to host browser plugins for wallets?
    
    - There appears to be a consistent need for browser wallet plugins
    - No wallet is needed for "light agents" that communicate with a separate full agent
- Issue with 'bitcode' being disabled in the IOS wrapper for Indy SDK. This makes the library incompatible with our commercial app that needs bitcode enabled. Does anyone know how to enable it or who to talk to about iOS issues? Bitcode needs to be enabled to submit to the App Store.
