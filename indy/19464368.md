## Main Business

**Rich Schemas Roadmap for Rich Schema MVP:**

- HIPE / RFCs (50% done)
  
  - Mapping and CredDefs use a single Schema only
  - Update Schema, Context and Encoding HIPEs/RFCs to match the Common format of rich schema objects
  
  <!--THE END-->
  
  - Mapping (Alex)
  - Cred Def (Alex)
  - Presentation Def 0.5 version (Ken and Brent)
  - Presentation (Ken and Brent)
  - Verifiable Credential (Alex)
  
  <!--THE END-->
- - Update existing HIPEs (Alex)
  - HIPEs for new objects:
- Indy Node implementation (95% done) (Alex)
- - Make sure that @id == id (Alex)
  - json\_ld validation for objects that must be json\_lds
- Indy-vdr (Andrew N)
  
  - need estimates
  
  <!--THE END-->
- - Prerequisite: CI / CD for indy-vdr, and integration into Indy SDK
  - Requests for every Rich Schema request
- aries-credx / indy-credx (Andrew N. and Echo)
- - create\_w3c\_cred
  - sign\_w3c\_cred
  - verify\_presentation
  - create\_presentation
  - Need estimates for all items

**Milestones:**

1. Issuance of W3C credentials
2. Presentation and verification

**Technical items:**

1. State/search
   
   - Discussed the current logic of storing objects in ledger State (two entries: id and type:name:version)
   - type:name:version can be used for discovery functionality
   - We may consider supporting of discovery by schema attribute names (either on Ledger, on Observers or off-chain)
2. HIPEs / RFCs
   
   - Agreed to reference just a single schema by a Mapping object (and hence a CredDef). This will simplify processing and will always have an explicit schema for every credentials.
     
     - If a CredDef or Mapping needs to use attributes from multiple Schema, it needs to create a new Schema first combining all sub-schemas
   - Agreed to have a shared common format for Schemas, Mappings and credentials:
     
     - Schema defines a set of attribute (as a graph object potentially)
     - Mapping uses a subset of the same attributes (as a graph potentially) following the same structure.
     - Every value in the Mapping object is a list of encoding and rank pairs.
     - Credentials has the same attributes as in Mapping
   - Agreed to implement Presentation Definition by phases:
     
     - Version 0.5: the same workflow as the current proof request
     - Version 0.6: more advanced one with groupings and selections
     - Version 1.0: final Presentation Definition interoperable with the community
   - There will be a Delta in protocols for Issuance and Presentation.
     
     - The workflow is supposed to be the same
     - The only difference is in the format of objects (to not be linked to old schema approach)
3. JSON-LD
   
   - What objects supposed to be in json-ld format:
     
     - Context - Json / json\_ld
     - Schema - json\_ld
     - Encoding - json
     - Mapping - json\_ld
     - CredDef - json
     - PresentationDef - json\_ld
   - Every JSON-LD is supposed to have
     
     - @id
     - @type
   - @id must be equal to the Rich Schema's ID (DID).
   - The only thing that we currently expect from json-ld processing is substitution of attributes by a fully-qualified ones
   - Due to the proposed format of Schemas, Mappings and Credentials, it looks like we don't need to do any JSON-LD processing/substitution during issuance
   - We may need to do JSON-LD processing/substitution during presentation
   - If we do JSON-LD processing/substitution, then for MVP we may assume that we resolve the contexts (substitute the fields belonging to a context) belonging to the current ledger only. We are not going to resolve other Indy ledger's context, other blockchain's contexts, and Internet contexts.
4. DID as ID
   
   - We considered 6 options on how ID may look like:
     
     - UUID
     - did:sov:const\_idstring?name=...;version=....
     - did:sov:issuer\_idstr?name=...;version=....
     - did:sov:context-hash-based-idstring
     - sch:sov:idstring
     - dri:sov:idstring
   - We think that we should go with did:sov:context-hash-based-idstring and the proposed Draft for canonicalization
   - We agree to postpone DID\_DOC resolving of Rich Schema object (we may decide not to do it at all)
   - The question whether it's OK to use a DID for Rich Schema objects identification is raised in Community
5. Old VS new credentials

Anoncreds 1.0Anoncreds 2.0Old Schema == old credentials0 (already done)2? (second priority if there is a need from product point)Rich Schema == W3C credentials1 (first prioarity)2 (second priority)

So, schema/credentials and Anoncreds version are two separate independent dimensions.
