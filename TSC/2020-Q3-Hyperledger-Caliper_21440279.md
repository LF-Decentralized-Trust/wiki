# Technical Oversight Committee : 2020 Q3 Hyperledger Caliper

Project Health

- The core code-base has been reworked to make it cleaner and more modular. All components now behave like plugins, following a general schema. Because of this, contributors can easily add new features in a well-defined, localized manner, without being familiar with the entire code-base.
- The documentation pages have been improved to provide hands-on tutorials about setting up Caliper with well-known examples of different DLTs. These are to be expanded.
- Community relations mainly happen on Rocket.Chat, and the questions are answered in detail, and on time. Furthermore, there is an increasing contributor/user interest related to the supported DLTs (Besu, Ethereum, Fabric v2).

# Questions/Issues for the TSC

There are no issues at this time.

# Releases

Working on releasing 0.4.0, within which the core code has been significantly refactored. Expect to release end of September 2020

# Overall Activity in the Past Quarter

**Project stats (since the last report)**

- Issues closed: 62
- PRs merged:53

**Development-related** 

- Keeping up with Fabric 2.x releases
- Core code refactor for clarity and modularisation
- Terminology changes/consolidations (adapter→connector, master→manager, callback→workload module, using "contract" everywhere)
- Simplification of the SUT connector API, with accompanying documentation to make the implementation of new connectors and maintenance of current connectors easier.

# Current Plans

v0.5 will include enhancements, including but not limited to

- Replacement of fabric connector
- Splitting out of configuration files to enable better use of shared configuration options

We intend to increase unit test code coverage, to augment the existing integration test suite

We would like to increase the maintainer list for target connectors, having at least one point of contact per Hyperledger SUT to assist in the development and maintenance of SUT connectors.

# Maintainer Diversity

The list of maintainers remained unchanged since the last report.

# Contributor Diversity

There are 40 contributors, 20 with noteworthy contributions. To the best of our knowledge, contributors are from various companies/organizations, such as Huawei, IBM, Intel, Soramitsu, Budapest University of Technology and Economics, Monax, and the University of Oregon.

# Additional Information

Following from the refactor to be included within the 0.4 release, and the intended additions within the 0.5 release, the maintainers would like to work towards a 1.0 release
