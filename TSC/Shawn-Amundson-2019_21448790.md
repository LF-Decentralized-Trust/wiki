# Nominated By

# Short personal bio

I am a maintainer and architect on several Hyperledger projects including Transact, Sawtooth, and Grid and hope to contribute to a few other projects during the next year as we increase cross-project collaboration. As CTO of Bitwise IO, I lead a team of engineers (including several maintainers) who are devoted to improving and building solutions on top of Hyperledger.

# Short personal pitch

We are stronger together. Over the past year, I've strongly advocated for cross-project collaboration. A major achievement in this area during the past year was the formation of the Hyperledger Transact project, which has the potential to become the foundational library for smart contract execution within Hyperledger.

As we look forward to the next year, I'll be a strong advocate for continued technical leadership within Hyperledger with an ever-increasing focus on cross-project collaboration. I'll continue to advocate for building a base of reusable library projects with which we can build increasingly interesting software solutions.
