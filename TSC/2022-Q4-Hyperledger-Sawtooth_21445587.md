# Questions/Issues for the TSC

No new issues.

# Releases

No recent releases

# Overall Activity in the Past Quarter

Contributors submitted a complex PR to the Go SDK to add consensus engine support, which was one of the largest non-maintainer PRs to have been submitted to Sawtooth. A re-implementation of dev mode consensus was included as an example.

The community continues to discuss Sawtooth-related issues on Discord, with more activity than in recent quarters.

# Current Plans

The following work is currently in progress:

- Go SDK enhancements
- Merge transaction execution components from Transact into the Sawtooth library

# Maintainer Diversity

Maintainers are distributed across [Bitwise](http://bitwise.io/) IO, Cargill, Intel, and Walmart Labs.
