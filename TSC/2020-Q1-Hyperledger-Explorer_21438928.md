# Technical Oversight Committee : 2020 Q1 Hyperledger Explorer

Created by Atsushi Neki, last modified by Arnaud J LE HORS on Jul 14, 2020

# Project

[Hyperledger Explorer](https://github.com/hyperledger/blockchain-explorer)

# Project Health

Project health is green. We released Tag  v1.0.0-rc2 on December 11. We use all of the following to help keep project health green: JIRA, RocketChat, email, Github, Azure Pipeline, Zoom and Skype. Questions asked via rocketchat are being answered in a timely manner. For greater efficiency in this regard the FAQs page is updated with every release. We are in need of more community involvement to maintain a green status for the project.

# Issues

Maintaining contributor numbers and diversity.

# Releases

v1.0.0-rc2: Released on December 11, 2019 to support HLFabric 1.4.4

## alpha-release

Iroha-integration: Released on Febrary 19, 2020 to support Iroha. It has been handled on a feature branch yet.

# Overall Activity in the Past Quarter

In this quarter the focus was on doing collaboration with iroha community members for iroha integration and fixing bugs. In support of that we worked on improving end-to-end test environment (catching up to the latest fabric-test) and adding some new features (support of multiple profiles and fabric v2.0, WIP).

# Current Plans

Unifying 2 platforms (fabric/iroha) support into master branch

Major release v1.0.0, submitted proposal [Hyperledger Explorer major release v1.0.0](Hyperledger-Explorer-major-release-v1.0.0_21437853.html)

Proposal to "Move HL Explorer out of the incubation", [Move Hyperledger Explorer from incubation to active status](Move-Hyperledger-Explorer-from-incubation-to-active-status_21430602.html)

Continue on bug fixes, help community in configuring HLExplorer , and troubleshooting.  

# Maintainer Diversity

We've had a few spot contributors added. No new maintainer were added. We really need community to come forward and contribute.

# Contributor Diversity

Current contributors are from DTCC and Fujitsu, There is some interest shown by members wishing to join the effort but no active contributions yet.
