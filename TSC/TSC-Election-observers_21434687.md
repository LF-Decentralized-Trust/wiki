# Technical Oversight Committee : TSC Election observers

Created by Arnaud J LE HORS, last modified on Mar 16, 2020

**Status**

RESOLVED

**Blocking**[TSC Election 2020](TSC-Election-2020_21434260.html)**Outcome**Rejected**Minutes Link**[2020 03 12 TSC Minutes](2020-03-12-TSC-Minutes_21438888.html)

[Per Brian's suggestion](https://lists.hyperledger.org/g/tsc/message/2680)

Proposed: The HL staff shall be helped by **two volunteer election observers** who are not running for the TSC, with whom the staff can CC on every election-related conversation they have or action they take, who can help them with the voter list, and with whom results can be shared. Just like HL staff, observers will not have access to the raw votes, though.
