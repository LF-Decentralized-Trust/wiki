# Technical Oversight Committee : TSC Membership Diversity

Created by Todd Little, last modified by Tracy Kuhrt on Oct 30, 2019

  **Status**

RESOLVED 

**Outcome** The TSC affirms that there should be no limits or quotas on TSC membership diversity**Minutes Link** [2019 10 10 TSC Minutes](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/TSC/2019+10+10+TSC+Minutes)

During the Hyperledger startup period there was a constraint on the number of TSC members from a single organization or its affiliates to no more than 3 members.  I'd like to propose that the TSC Membership always be constrained such that no more than 25% of the members can be from one organization or its affiliates.  Hyperledger is a project to promote decentralized networks, why wouldn't we want to ensure the technical leadership is also decentralized?  Conway's law states: "organizations which design systems ... are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations."
