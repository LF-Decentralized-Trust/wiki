# Maintainer Diversity

We've had a few spot contributors added. No new maintainers were added. We really need the community to come forward and contribute.

Please find here the maintainers list. [https://github.com/hyperledger/blockchain-explorer/blob/master/MAINTAINERS.md](https://github.com/hyperledger/blockchain-explorer/blob/master/MAINTAINERS.md)

# Contributor Diversity

Current main contributors are from DTCC and Fujitsu. We have 4 unique contributors on Github and 6 unique reporters on JIRA in this quarter.

We have started conversation about [Contribute-a-thon](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=21791436) for Hyperledger Explorer project with [David Boswell](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/70121:0a14f738-3039-421f-a6a9-a83d19f23227?ref=confluence) and [Ry Jones](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/557058:078cecfc-fb17-4d9a-8759-b5b74efa6850?ref=confluence)

And we had some proposals for Hyperledger Explorer as below:

- [minifab](https://github.com/litong01/minifabric) project is offering Hyperledger Explorer support as one of their features and we think it will be a good mutual reference.
- [hyperledger-explorer-made-easy](https://github.com/saanvijay/hyperledger-explorer-made-easy) project is a kind of utility tool for easy setup of Hyperledger Explorer. After evaluating this tool and having consensus for merging it into Explorer repo within the team, we might get it included into Explorer as one of the official features.
