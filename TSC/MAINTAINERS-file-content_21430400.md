While every project has a MAINTAINERS file there are large variations as to how it is structured and what it actually contains. It would be good to create a standard structure with guidelines as to what it should contain.

In particular, the staff wants to have contact info for the maintainers which is not easy to get. LF IDs and Github IDs for instance are not sufficient.
