# Short personal bio

Tracy Kuhrt is a Technology Architect within Accentureâ€™s Emerging Technology with 20+ years of experience covering the entire software development lifecycle. Tracy has been involved in the blockchain space since 2015, with a primary focus on Hyperledger.

# Short personal pitch

I would like to nominate myself - Tracy Kuhrt - to serve on the Hyperledger Technical Steering Committee. I am a Technology Architect at Accenture, where I focus on architecting and implementing blockchain solutions. I am also working with our teams to contribute some of our internal assets to Hyperledger Labs, with the goal of incubating them as Hyperledger projects.

Prior to joining Accenture, I spent not quite 2 years as a Hyperledger Community Architect evangelizing the organization and all of its projects at both meetups and conferences around the world, supporting the community, and improving the collaboration tools. This experience allowed me to build relationships with many in the community and gain a deep understanding of the challenges that the technical community faces on a daily basis.

In addition to my role as a Hyperledger Community Architect, I was one of the co-proposers of Hyperledger Labs and serve as a Hyperledger Labs Steward. I have contributed to many of the Hyperledger projects and labs. I am an active member of the Diversity, Civility, and Inclusion working group, and previously made contributions to the output of the Architecture working group and Whitepaper working group. I am part of the Hyperledger Speakers Bureau.

I would be honored to serve on the Hyperledger Technical Steering Committee and will strive to make the community even stronger. Thank you for your consideration.

Communities are stronger when

- everyone is welcome and people feel like they belong.
- there is a diverse set of opinions.
- we push each other out of our comfort zones.
- we listen and learn from others (be those others in the community or outside of the community).
- we have shared goals.
