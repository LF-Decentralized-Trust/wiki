Project health is largely the same as in previous update. We are making a very large architectural design change (support consortium governing), and there are many (10+) participants in the weekly meeting and actively discuss new issues.

# Issues

There are no major issues at this time. But definitely it would be nice to have more diversity.

# Overall Activity in the Past Quarter
