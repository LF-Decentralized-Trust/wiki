Created by Mark Ford, last modified by Swetha Repakula on Dec 11, 2019

## Project

Hyperledger Grid[https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/grid](https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/grid)

## Project Health

Health is good. Sponsors and contributors continue collaborative design work involving RFCs to define Catalog for Grid using industry standards for supply-chain.

Work is being managed utilizing the community tools provided by Hyperledger. Community interactions are typically done via rocketchat discussions.

## Issues

New issues

- There are no specific issues at the moment.

## Releases

- No prior releases.

## Overall Activity in the Past Quarter

Weekly design sessions are underway involving sponsors and contributors collaborating on Grid design.

The project is active. Some highlights:

- Completed design RFC for Grid Primitives
- Completed design RFC for defining Product using GS1 standards
- RFC for Grid Catalog is up for reviews
- Defining Grid documentation contents as a guide for future development

## Current Plans

Specific plans include:

- Finish implement GS1 Product framework as defined by design RFCs
- Implement GS1 Catalog framework as defined by design RFCs

## Maintainer Diversity

The list of active maintainers for Hyperledger Grid currently remains unchanged.

We anticipate adding additional maintainers, as contributions increase in areas currently in development.

## Contributor Diversity

Sponsoring organizations that are actively contributing to Grid include Cargill, Target, GS1, and Bitwise IO. In total, there are 18 active contributors to Grid across five active organizations
