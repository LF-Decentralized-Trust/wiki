Subject: LF Decentralized Trust TAC Election candidates and how to vote

I'd like to announce the candidates for the 2025 LF Decentralized Trust Technical Advisory Council (TAC) election. There are 10 people running this year.  As a reminder, with the recent changes to the Charter there will be 6 people selected for the TAC based on the votes of maintainers and then the Governing Board will select 5 more people.

This election is a chance for you to influence the direction and character of the LF Decentralized Trust community.  I encourage you to take the time to read the following candidate statements linked from this email and consider your vote carefully.  The nominees are:

- [Arun S M](https://github.com/LF-Decentralized-Trust/governance/issues/54)
- [Enrique Lacal](https://github.com/LF-Decentralized-Trust/governance/issues/63)
- [Hendrik Ebbers](https://github.com/LF-Decentralized-Trust/governance/issues/55)
- [Kamlesh Nagware](https://github.com/LF-Decentralized-Trust/governance/issues/53)

You will be using the [Helios election tool](https://vote.heliosvoting.org/helios/e/2025-LF-Decentralized-Trust-TAC-election). It is a voting system that is integrated with Github.

Details about how to vote have been sent through Github to all eligible voters on Monday, November 1 and voting will remain open until 23:59 UTC November 14.

If you [are eligible to vote](https://lf-decentralized-trust.github.io/tac-eligibility-check/) please visit [this link](https://vote.heliosvoting.org/helios/e/2025-LF-Decentralized-Trust-TAC-election) while logged in to GitHub and vote. Voting ends [14 Nov 2024](https://lf-decentralized-trust.github.io/governance/member-info/election-timeline.html). The top six will be on the TAC; the board will then choose five people to fill the remaining seats.

Thank you,

Ry
