**Hyperledger Explorer Community Response**

1Project has reached active status (the processes and community are mature)HL Explorer needs a promoted release before graduating to active status2The release features substantially fulfil the project's charterYes3The release satisfies criteria defined by the project itself. All projects should meet some internally defined non-functional release criteria (bug counts, performance, etc.)

   a. Test coverage (unit and functional/integration) is sufficient to have confidence that the release supports the non-functional criteria

Test coverage meets criteria

   b. Maintainers have reviewed all remaining open bugs and agree on severity/priority

No high priority bugs

  c. Zero high or highest priority bugs remain open

zero high priority bugs

  d. The preceding release candidate has been published for a minimum period of time of 2 weeks

v1.0.0 published on Apr 26th 2020

  e. The release should not require users/operators to compile code to operate the base project on supported platforms

Minor configuration required, build scripts provided and available repo [Hyperledger Explorer docker repository](https://hub.docker.com/r/hyperledger/explorer/).

  f. The documentation is sufficient to ensure that users/operators have clear guidance on how to get started and how to configure and operate.

Instruction provided in [Run Hyperledger Explorer Using Docker](https://github.com/hyperledger/blockchain-explorer/blob/master/README.md#Run-Hyperledger-Explorer-using-Docker)4The project has met all technical criteria for the release.

  a. The project has met all the criteria for [CII Best Practices Badge](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/) Best Practices Badge

[HLExplorer CII Best Practices](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/en/projects/2710)  
  b. A security audit provided by Hyperledger was completed

      i. no bugs that affect security of the system remain open unless they have mitigating workarounds published in release notesdone, [by automatic scan](https://lgtm.com/projects/g/hyperledger/blockchain-explorer?mode=tree)  
      ii. crypto code included in the release has been audited for crypto export complianceN/A
