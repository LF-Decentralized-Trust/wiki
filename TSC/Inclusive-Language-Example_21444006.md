# Technical Oversight Committee : Inclusive Language Example

Created by Tracy Kuhrt on Feb 17, 2022

*Inclusive Language:* 

- *Consider that users who will read the docs are from different background and cultures and that they have different preferences.*
- *Avoid potential offensive terms and, for instance, prefer "allow list and deny list" to "white list and black list".*
- *We believe that we all have a role to play to improve our world, and even if writing inclusive doc might not look like a huge improvement, it's a first step in the right direction.*
- *We suggest to refer to [Microsoft bias free writing guidelines](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/bias-free-communication) and [Google inclusive doc writing guide](https://developers.google.com/style/inclusive-documentation) as starting points.*
