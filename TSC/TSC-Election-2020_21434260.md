## Eligibility

The [Hyperledger Charter](https://www.hyperledger.org/about/charter) §4.a.ii defines the technical steering committee.

- **Steady State:** After the Startup Period, there shall be a nomination and election period for electing Contributors or Maintainers to the TSC. The TSC voting members shall consist of fifteen (15) elected Contributors or Maintainers chosen by the Active Contributors. An Active Contributor is defined as any Contributor who has had a contribution accepted into the code base during the prior twelve (12) months. The TSC shall approve the process and timing for nominations and elections held on an annual basis.
- **Maintainers:** Contributors who have the ability to commit code and contributions to a project’s main branch on an HLP project. A Contributor may become a Maintainer by a majority approval of the existing Maintainers.
- **Contributors:** Anyone in the technical community that contributes code, documentation or other technical artifacts to the HLP codebase.

## FAQ

**Q:** How does one qualify to be able to vote or be nominated?

**A:** The Charter states "Anyone in the technical community that contributes code, documentation or other technical artifacts to the HLP codebase."

The Community Architecture team gathers this information together first by running [This tool](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/hyperledger-community-management-tools/tree/master/get_contributors) is [run against "all" and "labs"](https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/tools/Get+Contributor+List+for+TSC+Election) to harvest from github everyone that has contributed to the code bases in the past year.   The CA's also email all of the work groups' Chairs to determine who has contributed other Documentation or technical artifacts.  There is also a form where people can petition about other technical contributions that have been made.

**Q:** How do I nominate myself or another person to run for a TSC seat?

**A:** First determine if you or the other person is eligible, see above.  If you are nominated somebody other than yourself, please contact them first and ask if they would like to be nominated. Then send an email to the [election mailing list](mailto:election@lists.hyperledger.org)  with the subject "**TSC Election Nomination**" with the following message:

Dear Election Committee,  
I nominate myself/&lt;nominee's name&gt; for the TSC election. My/their email address is &lt;email&gt;.

Thanks,  
&lt;your name&gt;

**Q:** Somebody nominated me for the TSC and I do not want to do it, what can I do?

**A:** All nominees will be asked confirm whether they want to be considered for the election. All you have to do is either respond to that email with "no" or email the [election@lists.hyperledger.org](mailto:election@lists.hyperledger.org) mailing list to say you do not want to be considered for the election.

**Q:** I think I should be eligible to vote in the Hyperledger TSC election. How do I appeal to be included?

**A:** Send an email to [election@lists.hyperledger.org](mailto:election@lists.hyperledger.org) with the subject "**Voter Eligibility**" and the following message:

My name: &lt;your name&gt;

My email: &lt;your email&gt;

I believe I should be able to vote in the TSC election because.... &lt;your reason for why you think you are eligible&gt;

**Q:** I didn't get an email.  How do I check? 

**A:** You can use our [online eligibility tool](https://hyperledger-labs.github.io/voters/) to check if your email is in the list of our eligible voters. You should check that email address you used at GitHub. We have had many complaints of them getting sent to spam. We are working on this but it is best if you whitelist [hyperledger.org](http://hyperledger.org). If your email address isn't in our list but you believe it should be you can appeal by following answer to the above question and send an email.
