Created by Tong Li, last modified on Aug 14, 2019

2019 Q2 Hyperledger Cello

# Project

- [Hyperledger Cello](https://github.com/hyperledger/cello)

# Project Health

Project health is largely the same as in previous update. The community is making  changes to make Cello more of a production ready tool. Features and capabilities are now more based on common use cases and behaviors of the Blockchain applications. Weekly meetings often see 10+ participates and often run over the allocated 30 minutes due to discussions and questions. In some cases, very well run pass 1 hour mark.

# Issues

There are no major issues at this time.

# Releases

- v0.9.0: Support v1.1/v1.2 fabric in k8s agent, Add v1.3 capabilities to ansible agent.
- v1.0.0: Most of the changes to the project are towards this release. We like to be very cautious and prudent on this release and will not rush it out.

# Overall Activity in the Past Quarter

- Ansible agent continued with many features additions:
  
  - Continue working on Interop artifacts generation, join request, orderering system endpoints and certificates integration
- Talk with Justitia proposal submmitter to bring the proposed functions/idea into cello and/or basically merge its work into Cello
- Added agent creation function on user dashboard
- Adding Fabric K8S operators with the Intership
- Continue improving user experience for user dashboard.
- Based new and future cello work on fabric 1.4.2 (community decision)
- Design the new architecture to support blockchain governing.
- Bug fixes and documentation improvement.

# Current Plans

Use new framework to unify all the user interface panelsHigh

Organize and manage fabric network dynamically

HighAdopt the Interop working group channel expansion methodLowSupport fabric 1.4 and later version (if using ansible agent, this is done already)Medium

# Maintainer Diversity

# Contributor Diversity
