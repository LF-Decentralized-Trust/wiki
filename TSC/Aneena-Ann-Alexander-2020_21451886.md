# Short personal bio

A Blockchain Evangelist who educates and inspires a growing community thereby reflecting the full breadth of the global blockchain ecosystem. I have been in academia for the past 5 years, and have mentored Undergraduate and Post Graduate students where we are focusing on leveraging Distributed Ledger Technology for a greater social impact. We're working together to identify use cases and opportunities to deliver profound and positive social impact by unlocking blockchain's transformative potential. I am taking a lead role in translating Hyperldger Fabric Documentation to Malayalam- a native language of the Indian State of Kerala, organized "Women in Blockchain" - a panel discussion, virtual meetups, Hyperledger Asia Pacific Online Certification Study Circle, targetting nontechnical, business-oriented audiences and students, so as to equip them with basics of Hyperledger technologies in association with Hyperldger India Chapter and Saintgits College of Engineering, Kerala India for the audience across the Asia Pacific this year.
