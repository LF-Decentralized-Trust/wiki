# Technical Oversight Committee : Common Repo structure

Created by Arnaud J LE HORS, last modified by Gari Singh on Oct 16, 2021

  **Status**

RESOLVED 

**Outcome**Unanimously approved**Minutes Link**[2020 02 13 TSC Minutes](2020-02-13-TSC-Minutes_21438615.html)

**Note**: This decision was amended by [End requirement to use Repolinter](End-requirement-to-use-Repolinter_21442196.html) and a textual definition of the common repository structure is now available: [https://tsc.hyperledger.org/repository-structure.html](https://tsc.hyperledger.org/repository-structure.html)

# Overview of Proposal

Hyperledger would benefit from a common repo structure which presents the same elements consistently. This includes:

- README
- SECURITY
- CODEOWNERS
- CODE\_OF\_CONDUCT
- CONTRIBUTING
- LICENSE
- MAINTAINERS
- NOTICES

# Formal Proposal(s)

Adopt [repolinter](https://github.com/todogroup/repolinter) with a policy as in [Fabric PR#630](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/pull/630). Each repo will add the same repolint.json file and the CA team (or preferably CI) will periodically run a check to ensure projects are in compliance. Additionally, we should establish a template repository that has LICENSE, NOTICE, CoC and Security default files.
