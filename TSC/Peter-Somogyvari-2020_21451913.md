# Technical Oversight Committee : Peter Somogyvari 2020

Created by Peter Somogyvari, last modified by Ry Jones on Aug 19, 2021

# Nominee Name

Peter Somogyvari

# Nominated By

Self

# Short personal bio

Peter is a technology architect at Accenture with a focus on databases, distributed ledger technologies and open source software development in general. 

He is maintainer of Hyperledger Cactus (formerly known as the Blockchain Integration Framework) 

As a polyglot programmer, he contributed to dozens of well-known projects over the years in several different technological areas/languages. 

Peter has years of experience in running the day to days of open source software projects and being a core contributor at the same time. 

# Short personal pitch

If elected to the TSC, I could bring my unique perspective about open source software communities, adoption curves and developer experience and developer evangelism and of course my deep technical expertise in general.  

My focus would be on 

- Lowering the barrier to entry for contributors across all Hyperledger projects and reducing the learning curve to minimize the number of potential community members dropping off at the beginning of the adoption funnel.
- Increase cohesiveness among the different projects within Hyperledger. To name an example of this, I’ve been spearheading an initiative to have Ursa compile to JavaScript both for NodeJS and the browser which would unlock/expose Ursa to a much larger community of software engineers who use JavaScript daily, but not Rust.
