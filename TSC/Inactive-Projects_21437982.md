# Overview of Proposal

See [Project Lifecycle Task Force Issue 1](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/TF/pages/20873418/Issue+1+When+do+we+know+that+a+project+is+done+What+are+the+end-of-life+criteria) Resolution 1.1

# Formal Proposal(s)

When a project, whether in Incubation or Active status, has not had any activities for over 6 months, it will be moved to "Deprecated" status and put on notice (via email to the project list) that it is on the path of being moved to "End of Life" (EOL) status. After an additional 6 months have passed, if no activity has taken place, pending TSC approval, the project will effectively be moved to EOL. Software releases and quarterly TSC reports, as well as significant code enhancements, will be considered as signs of "activities".
