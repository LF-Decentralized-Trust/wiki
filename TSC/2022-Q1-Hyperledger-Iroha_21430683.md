# Technical Oversight Committee : 2022 Q1 Hyperledger Iroha

Created by Sara Garifullina, last modified by Peter Somogyvari on May 24, 2022

Project Health

We are still continuing working as 2 teams – Iroha 1 and Iroha 2. Both teams develop features, fix issues, talk to the community. Still, once in 2 weeks we meet for our community meeting (where anyone could attend). Iroha 2 is planning to show their first working version soon, Iroha 1 constantly improving the production-ready versions and implemented a couple of very nice features to increase the performance and experience. We have questions from the community on various integrated projects which we might need to discuss soon (e.g using Burrow or Ursa). 

# Required Information

# Overall Activity in the Past Quarter

In terms of communications, chats were rather active, mailing lists - not so much. The questions are being answered, communication continues as well as the community calls – so if someone wants to connect, they certainly can. 

In terms of development: 

#### Iroha v1:

Made a release of 1.4 - rc1 (tag is ready for rc2 as well - just needs to be published as a release)

Added the feature of syncing node

Healthcheck

Fixes on the memory consumption and others

#### Iroha v2:

Improved performance

Added prometheus metrics for profiling

Integrated WASM to support more smart contracts

Integrating triggers

# Current Plans

Both Iroha 1 and Iroha 2 teams are active and have their own objectives:

#### Iroha v1:

Release 1.4 based on release candidate 2

Speed up internal communication within Iroha

Moving configuration into the blockstore

Minimise OS traffic

#### Iroha v2:

Refactor Sumeragi consensus

Memory consumption improvements, 

Final testing for preview release candidate 1

New procedure for SDK synchronisation

# Maintainer Diversity

1 C++ developer and 1 QA specialist joined Iroha 1 team. Iroha 2 was joined by a new project manager who will be leading the development and the project in general and a Rust developer as well as several specialists contributing into the libraries 

# Contributor Diversity

Soramitsu maintains Iroha still with help from [baziorek](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/70121:fcfd1447-e409-47ac-bf14-f78e6031899d?ref=confluence)'s team
