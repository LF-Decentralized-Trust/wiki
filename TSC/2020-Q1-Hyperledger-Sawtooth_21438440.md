# Technical Oversight Committee : 2020 Q1 Hyperledger Sawtooth

Created by Mark Ford, last modified by Dan Middleton on Jan 30, 2020

# Project

Hyperledger Sawtooth [https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/](https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/)

# Project Health

New features:

- Sawtooth 1.2 was released after an extended round of stability, performance and regression testing. The features contained in the 1.2 release were originally reported in previous 2019 Sawtooth quarterly updates.
- libsawtooth was released. This Rust library begins to move Sawtooth features into reusable code modules for other applications to construct block chain solutions.  Currently, it provides a module for transaction receipt storage. It is available via [crates.io](http://crates.io), the standard Rust library repository.

Bug fixes:

- Fixed timestamp check in block\_info for catchup
