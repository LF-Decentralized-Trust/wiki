- Chris Ferris to drive forward CII Security Badge [discussion](https://lists.hyperledger.org/pipermail/hyperledger-tsc/2016-December/000500.html)
- - Need a formal process (response and escalation for remediating vulnerabilities) once Security Maven is hired.
  - Also look at security scans, both from code and penetration, as well as other aspects.
  - Some discussion about incorporating code scanning into CI.  But, would need tools available for this (Hyperledger may need to purchase).
  - Discussion ensued regarding independent peer review of projects (advisory role, not a gating mechanism).
  - - Formalizing a function that WGs can provide peer review -- deferring to WG Charter discussions next week.
- Hackfests
- - San Francisco (February 1-2) [register](https://www.regonline.com/hyperledgerfebruary2017) / [agenda](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12GHlJlX0NntEtiVYwl1w0V6JRibD66LuAmKBGGRxxfo/edit)

- Monthly Project updates
- - Each project to send a monthly update for the 3rd TSC meeting of the month (Todd to send a reminder).  Paragraph or bullet points are both acceptable.
- Comms tools
- - Talked last year about various alternatives to Slack -- but, didn’t pan out effectively.  Cannot afford enterprise version of Slack.
  - ACTION:  Ry to check in with LF IT on cost associated with hosting Rocket.Chat
