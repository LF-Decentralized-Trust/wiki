## Discussion

- [TSC Election process approval](TSC-Election-process-approval_21434681.html)
  
  - Proposed: The process &amp; timeline shall be proposed by the HL staff to the TSC and affirmed by a vote on an annual basis.
- [TSC Election timing](TSC-Election-timing_21434701.html)
  
  - Proposed: TSC elections shall be conducted in October, leaving September to do the data collection to determine who's allowed to vote and take nominations.
- [TSC Election nominations](TSC-Election-nominations_21434695.html)
  
  - Proposed: Nominations shall be posted to the TSC list and limited to self-nominations.
- [TSC Election observers](TSC-Election-observers_21434687.html)
  
  - Proposed: The HL staff shall be helped by **two volunteer election observers** who are not running for the TSC, with whom the staff can CC on every election-related conversation they have or action they take, who can help them with the voter list, and with whom results can be shared. Just like HL staff, observers will not have access to the raw votes, though.
- [TSC Quorum](TSC-Quorum_21431698.html)
  
  - Proposed: Any TSC member who fails to attend two consecutive TSC meetings will not be counted for purposes of determining quorum requirements as of the third consecutive meeting and until they next attend a TSC meeting.
- [TSC Co-chair/Vice-chair](21431694.html)
  
  - Proposed: Add a vice-chair who can take over when the chair is not available. The first member to win the election is chair, the second is vice-chair.
- [TSC Size](TSC-Size_21430312.html)
  
  - Proposal: Extend the size of the TSC to 15 (pending Board approval). To get started, add the next 4 candidates from the last election results to the current term.
