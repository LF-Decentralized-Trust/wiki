**Hackfest Planning**

- US:  9/21 &amp; 9/22 in Chicago [register now](https://www.regonline.com/hyperledgerhackfestseptember2017) | [draft agenda](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gmSkA1Y0YkUAHfEfJNMuDf4uhwjpr32r2ykMvYKKnqo/edit)
- Europe:  preference between week of 10/23 vs. 10/30, weekend or weekday, and city?
- - No objections to Brian’s suggestion of Berlin
  - Consensus was for this to fall roughly in the middle of 10/23 to 11/3 to avoid other industry events on the shoulder dates
  - No major objections to holding this over a weekend
  - Hyperledger Staff to bring firm proposal back to TSC for next week

**TSC Annual Election**

**PSWG Charter**

- Revised [draft](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OtGmVvHa_LDhIm5t1HEI7XwCQt1Lpr4gRmWixoJWQzg/edit)
- Mark noted that changes have been reflected in bold and that the PSWG needs to review one final time before this comes back to TSC for vote.
- A question was raised as to whether WGs should be voting based or consensus based.
- - Consensus is the best approach -- Arnaud and Ram will share some best practices from W3C on building consensus
  - That said, WG Chairs are left to decide if a formal vote or a consensus is most suitable.

**Whitepaper WG Update**

- Approaching the completion of a draft of whitepaper that will be shared with TSC and others to solicit final edits or approval
- WG thought it might be better to rename it to “Hyperledger Position Paper”
- - No objections.
- Have relatively good infrastructure where whitepaper is a tech document that lives in GitHub, however, it lives in Mic’s GitHub account, would prefer to move this over the LF account.
- - Hart to email [helpdesk@rt.linuxfoundation.org](mailto:helpdesk@rt.linuxfoundation.org) to get it moved.

**Architecture WG Update**

- Hyperledger Architecture, Volume 1 has been [published](https://www.hyperledger.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/HyperLedger_Arch_WG_Paper_1_Consensus.pdf).
