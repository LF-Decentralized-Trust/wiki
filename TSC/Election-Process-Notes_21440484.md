# Technical Oversight Committee : Election Process Notes

Created by Ry Jones, last modified by David Huseby on Oct 12, 2020

- You can enable a short-term inbound email alias for election@lists. You do it this way:
  
  - Set the \`reply-to\` for outbound email to [election@hyperledger.org](mailto:election@hyperledger.org)
  - Under [integrations](https://lists.hyperledger.org/g/election/integrations), create an unmoderated alias
  - Using ITX, forward [election@hyperledger.org](mailto:election@hyperledger.org) to the new, temporary alias
- After nominations have been gathered, be sure to confirm with the nominees how they want their name to appear on the ballot.
- Announce the winners on the Monday following the end of the election so that we can coordinate with press.
