### Announcements

DCI:

- The DCI survey has incorporated edits from the fall review. HL marketing suggests it launch ahead of the Davos marketing campaign so we can make use of visibility from those hyperledger activities. This window also lets us assemble results in time to share at HLGF.
- HL is requesting mentors for HLGF for a speed mentoring session. Details of the session can be found at [https://hgf20.sched.com/event/ZFSk/mentor-session](https://hgf20.sched.com/event/ZFSk/mentor-session). Be sure to sign up soon as spots are limited! Based on your interest, please complete the [MENTOR](https://forms.gle/QkkEdJdVZ4nYWGu1A) or [MENTEE](https://forms.gle/ngpBvHV1Jhhp6mFTA) form.

### Items of discussion

- Do we still want to have quarterly reports from working groups?
  
  - If there is a WG that produces things, we should still have reporting.
  - If it is just a discussion forum, then probably not.
  - Not deciding now.
- Proposal: Approve [Replace "Major Releases" with "Promoted Releases"](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=24779174)
  
  - Decision is to amend the proposal language for consideration in the next TSC meeting.
- Proposal: Abandon [Forgo Active state requirement for First Major Release](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/display/TSC/Forgo+Active+state+requirement+for+First+Major+Release)
  
  - Forego active requirement for first major release?
  - Vote: 1 yes, 1 abstain, 8 no. REJECTED.
