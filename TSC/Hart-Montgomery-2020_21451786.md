# Short personal bio

Hi everyone! A little bit about me: I’m a research scientist in cryptography at Fujitsu Labs. I work on a number of different aspects of cryptography (and applications of crypto) including blockchain, crypto for the blockchain, post-quantum cryptography, and cryptographic complexity. Prior to Fujitsu, I did a Ph.D. at Stanford in crypto under Dan Boneh.

I’ve had the good luck to have been involved in Hyperledger since almost the very beginning. Among other things, I’ve been on the TSC since the startup phase of Hyperledger, and I have attended, spoken at, or helped to organize almost every global Hyperledger event. I helped to start Ursa (where I’m a maintainer on the theory side), and I’m planning to continue working on the crypto/security aspects of Hyperledger through whatever venues seem appropriate in the future.  I'm also interested in blockchain integration and think this will be a very important topic in the future of blockchain.  In this direction, this past year I helped to found Cactus, and I am a contributor there as well.

# Short personal pitch

Due to the fact that security, privacy, and confidentiality are absolutely paramount for many Hyperledger applications, I think it is vital that there is a strong cryptography/security presence in the Hyperledger community, including the TSC. Even if your preferred slate does not include me, please consider voting for at least some people with strong security and cryptography backgrounds.  I am also interested in interoperability and modularity in Hyperledger, as evidenced by work on both Ursa and Cactus, and aim to encourage work in this direction in Hyperledger.  Thanks for your time.
