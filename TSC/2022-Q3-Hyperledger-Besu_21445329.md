# Technical Oversight Committee : 2022 Q3 Hyperledger Besu

Created by Matt Nelson, last modified by Jim Zhang on Nov 02, 2022

Project Health

The Merge brought many new users, community members, and new challenges in Q3. The project remains healthy, but needs to return to more and/or new standard and best practices following the Merge crunch. 

# Required Information

1. [Have you switched from master to main in all your repos](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/TSC/Projects+have+two+quarters+to+comply+with+common+repo+structure?focusedCommentId=21452776)? Yes
2. [Have you implemented the Common Repository Structure in all your repos](https://tsc.hyperledger.org/repository-structure.html)? Yes
3. Has your project implemented these inclusive language changes listed below to your repo? You can optionally [use the DCI Lint tool](https://github.com/petermetz/gh-action-dci-lint#usage) to make this a recurring action on your repo.
   
   1. master → main
   2. slave → replicas
   3. blacklist → denylist
   4. whitelist → allowlist
4. Have you added an [Inclusive Language Statement](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/TSC/Inclusive+Language+Example) to your project's documentation and/or Wiki pages? Yes

# Overall Activity in the Past Quarter

The Besu project has finally gone through the Merge. This has caused a few changes to project health, not all positive. Code quality and release cadence have been affected by the Merge, but are likely to resume normal process or work on a community proposal around new standard best practices. The community and project have seen growth from Ethereum Mainnet users, but contributors remains mostly the same. The Discord channels have exploded with activity around staking set-ups and questions for Public networks. Some new user PRs have entered, some relating to Merge code and vulnerabilities. The project remains growing in usage and development, and hopes to return process and code quality to normal following Merge crunch to best serve use-cases outside of Ethereum Mainnet.

Below some notable improvements and features: 

Bonsai gained a number of robustness improvements. Performance has been tweaked and improved in many areas, especially peering.  

# Current Plans

This quarter brings a focus on post-Merge cleanup and transition code removal and a heavy emphasis on resolving Merge tech debt and cleaning up outstanding bugs and performance issues. No major feature development is planned for the immediate quarter.  

# Maintainer Diversity

No new maintainers were added.

Corporate distribution is unchanged from the last quarters report (ConsenSys, Splunk, Hedera, ETC Co-operative).

# Contributor Diversity

Many new users came to the Besu community to add feature requests, provide bug logs and to open issues, and to work with the team in Discord. The overall contributor diversity has improved from these efforts, though we will have to work hard to keep and convert these contributors into maintainers.
