Created by David Huseby, last modified on Jan 08, 2019

**NOTE:**Â This is a rough draft and work in progress, feel free to add/modify the contnt.

- Use Soramitsu projects to get client developers to contribute to Iroha.
  
  - Upstream the code created under contract so that the "community edition" is the version clients use in production.
- Partner with universities to get Iroha used as a teaching tool.
  
  - Internships for students.
  - Create free educational materials and lesson plans.
  - Run hack-fests at universities.
- Do an aggressive speaking schedule where Iroha is demonstrated solving real world problems.
- Enter hack-a-thon competitions to try to win with Iroha solutions.
- Start a code bounty program to incentivize outside developers to learn the code and contribute.
- Partner with non-profits/NGOs to offer Iroha as a technical solution where appropriate.
- Gain approval for use in government applications.
