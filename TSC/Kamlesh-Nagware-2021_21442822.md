# Short personal pitch

I would like to nominate myself to serve on the Technical Steering Committee.  My role as CTO in a Blockchain startup and 6 years of Blockchain experience(Total 12 yrs experience of software design &amp; development) would be helpful for the Hyperledger Technical steering committee. In the last 6 years, I have worked with diverse sets of use cases at different stages Proof of Concept to large-scale production deployment. Working with so many use cases and the different sizes of project implementation experience is helpful for making a decision and roadmap for Hyperledger technologies. Recently  I have done a presentation on the Hyperledger fabric performance improvement plan in the Hyperledger contributor meeting, actually this improvement plan I have created for one of my enterprise customer who needs fabric performance up to 50 K TPS for large-scale deployment. As Hyperledger India chapter lead I have organized "blockchain success stories 2020 &amp; 2021 and Hyperhack 2020 &amp; 2021, student society chapter and currently working with community &amp; hyperledger staff to set up Industry wing in the Hyperledger India chapter. Also, responded to " India Blockchain Policy" to consider Hyperledger technologies for India blockchain infrastructure.
