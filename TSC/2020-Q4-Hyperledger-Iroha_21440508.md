# Technical Oversight Committee : 2020 Q4 Hyperledger Iroha

Created by Sara Garifullina, last modified by María Teresa nieto on Oct 27, 2020

# Project

Hyperledger Iroha

Project Health

The development during the period has been a little slow, but community activities seem to be in order — people communicate in chats, receive their answers, everyone is acting appropriately and respectfully. Also, we have finished several Internship projects for the improvement of Hyperledger Iroha. 

# Questions/Issues for the TSC

No issues at the moment. 

# Releases

[Hyperledger Iroha v1.2 Release Candidate 2](https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/releases/tag/1.2.0-rc.2)

# Overall Activity in the Past Quarter

Development was a little slowed down but at the same time, we managed to finish all the internship projects. Unfortunately, not all of them was finished successfully — 2 were terminated because of the lack of commitment from the students.

Chats are active even if the mailing list is not so much.

After the security audit and feedback from the community, we made several security fixes for the release.

# Current Plans

Currently, we want to make a release with "1.2.0rc3" tag which will be thoroughly tested towards finding regression problems. After testing we will release version "1.2.0" with all the fixes, which could be a very stable and reliable milestone of the Hyperledger Iroha development.

After that we will start active development of the "2.0" version which will solve most of the current challenges — it is our longer-term plan. 

# Maintainer Diversity

[https://github.com/orgs/hyperledger/teams/iroha-maintainers/members](https://github.com/orgs/hyperledger/teams/iroha-maintainers/members) represents people who help maintain Iroha.

# Contributor Diversity

A company that uses Iroha contributed Turkish translation of the Iroha documentation on which we started basing our l10n repo - currently in development of simpler scripts. 

Iroha Blockchain Explorer - a useful #nodejs and #docker solutions were contributed by diva.exchange
