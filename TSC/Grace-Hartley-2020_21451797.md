Created by Grace Hartley (Deactivated), last modified by Ry Jones on Aug 19, 2021

# Nominee Name

Grace Hartley

# Nominated By

Danno Ferrin

# Short personal bio

I am a Strategy &amp; Operations Associate at ConsenSys on the ConsenSys Quorum team (fka PegaSys team). I joined ConsenSys two years ago. A few of my focus areas at ConsenSys include, community management activities for Hyperledger Besu, managing the ConsenSys partner program, and supporting product launch activities and initiatives. I led the initiative to gain approval and onboard Hyperledger Besu, the Java-based Enterprise Ethereum client, into the Hyperledger community and I managed the project's activities to help it gain active status. Prior to joining the blockchain world, I was a consultant in the financial services industry.

# Short personal pitch

Over the past year since ConsenSys and Hyperledger Besu joined Hyperledger, I have witnessed exciting community collaboration and have been inspired by the breadth of activities Hyperledger fosters. Hyperledger has also proven its willingness to continuously improve and challenge its assumptions. I have personally enjoyed being a member of the Global Forum Planning Committee, joining several working groups, contributing content to the Hyperledger blog, and participating in various community activities. I believe I can provide a fresh perspective to the Technical Steering Committee by acting as a community-centric voice as well as provide lessons learned and best practices from the Enterprise Ethereum ecosystem. As a TSC member, I would look to promote diversity and inclusion efforts as well as amplify voices from the community.
