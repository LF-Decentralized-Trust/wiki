# Technical Oversight Committee : 2019 Q4 Hyperledger Sawtooth

New features:

- Focus has been on stability, performance and regression testing for the upcoming 1.2 release. The features contained in the 1.2 release were originally reported in previous 2019 Sawtooth quarterly updates.

Bug fixes:

- The ongoing transition of the codebase from Python to Rust changed the dynamics of calls across the FFI boundary. This led to some complex performance regressions which showed up during long-running-network testing with PoET consensus. Detailed instrumentation of the FFI calls suggested targeted optimizations to reduce or eliminate expensive boundary crossings. Final long-running-network tests with these changes are wrapping up, which should culminate in a 1.2 release shortly.
