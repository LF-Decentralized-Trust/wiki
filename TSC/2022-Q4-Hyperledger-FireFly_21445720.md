# Technical Oversight Committee : 2022 Q4 Hyperledger FireFly

Created by Ray Chen, last modified by Jim Zhang on Jan 09, 2023

Project Health

Following the release of FireFly 1.1 last quarter, work on FireFly has mainly centered around maintenance, debugging, and enhancements in the 1.1.1 and 1.1.2 releases. Additionally, we've updated the docs to include more tutorials and introductions to FireFly.

The Discord community continues to be very active with 66 members participating in discussions this quarter. Additionally, we’ve seen an increase in non-maintainer engagement, with community members conversing and answering each other’s questions.

Contributors are very active in the project and since September, excluding merges, we’ve had 21 authors push 254 commits to main.

There are currently 587k lines of code for Hyperledger FireFly across 19 repositories, with a total of 6.6k commits to date.
