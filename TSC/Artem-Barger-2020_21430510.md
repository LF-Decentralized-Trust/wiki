### Short personal pitch

I would like to nominate myself - Artem Barger - to serve on the Hyperledger Technical Steering Committee. Since 2016 I'm focused on blockchain-related research areas, starting my journey by participating in the design and development of Hyperledger Fabric v1.0, where the primary area of interest was scalable middleware for blocks replication and dissemination. Eventually have been promoted and honored to become part of Hyperledger Fabric maintainers family, since then actively participating in technical meetings and reviewing code.

During the last 3.5 years, I'm actively contributing and supporting the community in many ways, from meetups participation in providing lectures in universities. Providing answers and helping developers to overcome the steepest learning curve and answer on [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/104014/artem-barger), where I'm still leading the top 10 list of most active users to provide answers: [hyperledger-fabric](https://stackoverflow.com/tags/hyperledger-fabric/topusers) and [hyperledger](https://stackoverflow.com/tags/hyperledger/topusers), helping users to establish a decent knowledge base in Hyperledger projects.

I'm  promoting Hyperledger projects withing Russian speaking community, organizing conference, and recording video tutorials:

1. [PG Day'17 Russia. Hyperledger — the architecture of the permissioned ledger. Artem Barger (IBM)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hy8QvfAnn0)
2. [PG Day'17 Russia. Hyperledger: hands-on session. Artem Barger (IBM)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyNffhRII48)
3. [TokenConf'18 - Hyperledger - the architecture of the permissioned ledger / Artem Barger (IBM)]()

due to my contribution to the Russian Blockchain and Hyperledger community was nominated to a very prestigious Highload Award two years in row 2018 and 2019. In 2019 assisted in the organization of Moscow Hyperledger Bootcamp, where provided a series of lectures and tutorials. Providing support and mentorship in Hyperledger related Russian telegram channels: [Hyperledger Russia](https://t.me/hyperledger_russia) and [Hypereldger Fabric Russia](https://t.me/hlbootcamp). Moreover, during recent years I have mentored and provided help for [Fabric Explorer](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/fabex) project to get accepted into Hyperledger Labs and become part of a larger eco-system.

Organized and presented in a series of Community Meetups:

1. [Meetup Sberbank and IBM on HyperLedger Fabric](https://sudonull.com/post/14340-Mitap-Sberbank-and-IBM-on-HyperLedger-Fabric)
2. [Blockchain: hack the hype](https://www.meetup.com/Blockchain-evolution-or-revolution/events/244627576/)
3. [Blockchain: hack the hype II](https://www.meetup.com/Blockchain-evolution-or-revolution/events/246859640/)

Looking to:

1. Expand my contribution to Hyperledger eco-system by serving Technical Steering Committee
2. Bringing my experience and skills to continue to build powerful technology embracing blockchain technology
3. Communicate and bring  contribution from the Russian community, communicating ideas, thoughts, and opinions

I'm really passioned and thrilled by Blockchain technology and truly believe together we can make Hyperledger even stronger, looking forward.

Thanks for the consideration,

                                              Artem Barger.
