# Technical Oversight Committee : 2020 Q2 Hyperledger Cello

Created by Tong Li, last modified by Gari Singh on Jun 11, 2020

# Project

- [Hyperledger Cello](https://github.com/hyperledger/cello)

# Project Health

Due to the continued covid-19,Â  most of the meetings were cancelled. Regular meetings started early this quarter.

Now we are re-designing the architecture and finishing the features for v1.0.

Reviewed summer internship applications (there were more than 20 applications for the project) and provided 3 candidates to Linux Foundation.

# Issues

The implementation of the new governing model is not as quick as planed. We are lacking of front end developers, will recruit some candidates.

# Releases

v1.0.0 (In plan)

- New governing model;
- Support fabric v1.4 LTS and 2.0 experimentally;
- K8S operator agent.

# Overall Activity in the Past Quarter

- Design the new governing model.
- Completed the new design for the dashboard and initial implementation is also complete.
- Updated the document for the new architecture.
- Moved cello build and test onto Azure and optimized the build so that only changed components get build and tested to save resources.

# Current Plans

Finish the new dashboard implementation (complete end of this year)High

Add k8s load balancer as a way to expose k8s operator agent created fabric node
