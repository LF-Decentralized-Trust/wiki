# Technical Oversight Committee : 2022 Q1 Hyperledger FireFly

Created by Nicko Guyer, last modified by Peter Somogyvari on May 03, 2022

Project Health

FireFly is doing great, and is expected to release v1.0.0 at the beginning of Q2. New community members are participating in discussions in Discord. The move to Discord has been a huge positive change for the FireFly community, and it is much more active than Rocket Chat ever was. New contributors also continue to make contributions to the project.

# Required Information

1. [Have you switched from master to main in all your repos](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/TSC/Projects+have+two+quarters+to+comply+with+common+repo+structure?focusedCommentId=21452776)? **Yes.**
2. [Have you implemented the Common Repository Structure in all your repos](https://tsc.hyperledger.org/repository-structure.html)? **Yes.**
3. Has your project implemented these inclusive language changes listed below to your repo? You can optionally [use the DCI Lint tool](https://github.com/petermetz/gh-action-dci-lint#usage) to make this a recurring action on your repo. **Yes.**

# Questions/Issues for the TSC

There are no issues at this time.

# Releases

The full list of releases can be found at: [https://github.com/hyperledger/firefly/releases](https://github.com/hyperledger/firefly/releases)

# Overall Activity in the Past Quarter

Discord is very active, and project maintainers are usually fairly prompt in answering questions there. Community calls are still happening every other week, though attendance has definitely declined, starting at the beginning of the year. Code activity is very high, as the team progresses toward the v1.0.0 release.

# Current Plans

The v1.0.0 release is the next major release, though there may be several patch releases before then. For detailed progress on v1.0.0, please see the GitHub project board: [https://github.com/orgs/hyperledger/projects/4/views/3](https://github.com/orgs/hyperledger/projects/4/views/3)

Beyond v1.0.0, there are several other major features, for which development will begin immediately following v1.0.0:

- Multiple ledger/blockchain support
- Active-active High Availability for FireFly Core

# Maintainer Diversity

New maintainers (since last report):

- David Echelberger [https://github.com/eberger727](https://github.com/eberger727)
- Hayden Fuss [https://github.com/hfuss](https://github.com/hfuss)

# Contributor Diversity

Contributions in Q1 including code, documentation, or other contributions:

Active contributors from Kaleido: 10

Active contributors from other organizations: 3 

# Additional Information

FireFly continues to make great progress, especially in technical enhancements. The community however, still needs to grow. We would love to see more users, contributors, and maintainers join the community. A very slow stream of new contributors wanting to get involved in the project continues to be a challenge. Those contributors gaining enough technical familiarity with the project, and being willing to take on the responsibilities of a maintainer poses an even larger challenge. These are obstacles to moving to a Graduated Project status. Any assistance that the Hyperledger Foundation can provide in overcoming these challenges would be appreciated.
