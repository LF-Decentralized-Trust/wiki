# Technical Oversight Committee : 2019 Q4 Hyperledger Quilt

Created by David Fuelling, last modified by Nathan George on Mar 31, 2020

# Project

[Hyperledger Quilt](https://github.com/hyperledger/quilt)

Project Health

Project health over Q4 has been very good. We had three releases this quarter (see below) and added two new contributors (see below).

# Issues

No blocking issues. Currently in-scope are Github issues labelled as [v1.0.3](https://github.com/hyperledger/quilt/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Av1.0.3).

# Releases

Quilt had three releases in Q4:

- Quilt [v1.0.0](https://github.com/hyperledger/quilt/releases/tag/v1.0.0): Our first production-ready release. Blog announcement [here](https://www.hyperledger.org/blog/2019/11/01/announcing-hyperledger-quilt-v1-0-interledger-for-the-java-platform).
- Quilt [v1.0.1](https://github.com/hyperledger/quilt/releases/tag/v1.0.1): Fixed minor bugs and enhanced developer experience (e.g., BOM dependency support)
- Quilt [v1.0.2](https://github.com/hyperledger/quilt/releases/tag/v1.0.2): Minor enhancements to more efficiently support ILP addresses and authentication.

# Overall Activity in the Past Quarter

Activity over the past quarter was strong. We released a production-ready 1.0 version of the library that has had two backwards-compatible patch-releases. We are in the process of deploying the library in a production system and will feedback any enhancements, bugs or issues into the project.

# Current Plans

We are currently planning another patch release near the end of January ([v1.0.3](https://github.com/hyperledger/quilt/issues?q=is%3Aopen%20is%3Aissue%20label%3Av1.0.3)). We are also tracking lower-priority features for a v1.1, but no targeted release date has been set. In Q1 2020, we anticipate one or two more patch releases, including v1.0.3.

# Maintainer Diversity

Maintainer diversity is unchanged with three people full-time maintaining the project. While our technical diversity is strong, we are all funded by the same company, so from this perspective diversity is low.

# Contributor Diversity

Contributor diversity is essentially unchanged. One additional contributor from [Ripple/Xpring](https://xpring.io/) was added to the project in December, 2019, which was offset by a new contributor from an unaffiliated entity. Otherwise, contributions are also coming from a developer at the University of Washington as well as the maintainers. 

# Additional Information

Not at this time.
