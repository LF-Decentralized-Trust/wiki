# Technical Oversight Committee : 2020 Q4 Hyperledger Quilt

Created by David Fuelling, last modified by Gari Singh on Feb 05, 2021

# Project

Hyperledger [Quilt](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/quilt/Hyperledger+Quilt)

Project Health

Project health over Q4 is unchanged, but good. We had no formal dot-releases, but are working on a new utility called "ILP Pay", which will make it easier to make payments using Quilt. No new contributors or maintainers joined the project during this quarter but we maintained the same core group of contributors.

# Questions/Issues for the TSC

There are no issues at this time.

# Releases

No new releases in Q4, but anticipate a new release in Q1 once "ILP Pay" is complete.

# Overall Activity in the Past Quarter

Activity was low this past quarter because the core dev team was focused on non-Interledger activity due to shifting priorities in their day-jobs. However, the primary maintainer has spent a lot of time over Q4 building "ILP Pay."

# Current Plans

The completion of "ILP Pay" utility is forcing various refactors in the [Java Connector](https://connector.interledger4j.dev/), allowing duplicate logic between Quilt and the Connector to be centralized into Quilt. These changes are expected be released formally in Q1 2021, and will make both the Quilt library and Connector more stable.

# Maintainer Diversity

Maintainer diversity is unchanged.

# Contributor Diversity

Contributor diversity is unchanged.

# Additional Information

Not at this time.
