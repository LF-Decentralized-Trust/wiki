# Overview of Proposal

Several questions have been raised against the way voters are selected for the TSC election. Typical questions include: what counts as a technical artifact? How can we collect valid email addresses so that people can be sent ballots?

From [TSC Election 2019](TSC-Election-2019_21434240.html), this is who was included in the list of eligible voters:

> The Community Architecture team gathers this information together first by running  [This tool](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/hyperledger-community-management-tools/tree/master/get_contributors)  is  [run against "all" and "labs"](https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/tools/Get+Contributor+List+for+TSC+Election)  to harvest from github everyone that has contributed to the codebases in the past year. The CA's also email all of the workgroups' Chairs to determine who has contributed other Documentation or technical artifacts.  There is also a form where people can petition about other technical contributions that have been made.

It is proposed to build on that status quo with a couple of additions.

# Formal Proposal(s)

Adopt the selection process used in 2019, using [the Hyperledger get\_contributors tool](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/hyperledger-community-management-tools/tree/master/get_contributors) [run against "all" and "labs"](https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/tools/Get+Contributor+List+for+TSC+Election) repositories to harvest from github everyone that has contributed to the codebases in the past year. The CAs also email all of the workgroups' and Task Force Chairs to determine who has contributed other Documentation or technical artifacts. In addition, a form is available for people to petition about other technical contributions that have been made.

CAs are entitled to clean the list from what they believe are fraudulent entries with notification to the TSC members.

Excluding changes such as bug fixes, improvements, and changes made to reflect the evolution of the list of Hyperledger repositories modifications to the [get\_contributors tool](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/hyperledger-community-management-tools/tree/master/get_contributors) that impact the produced list must be endorsed by the TSC.
