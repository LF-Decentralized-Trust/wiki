# Technical Oversight Committee : 2020 Q2 Hyperledger Grid

Created by Andi Gunderson, last modified by Gari Singh on Jun 11, 2020

# Project

Hyperledger Grid:[https://www.hyperledger.org/use/grid](https://www.hyperledger.org/use/grid)

Project Health

Health is good.Â  The Splinter backend has been updated to use Splinter 0.4 which was recently released, so both Sawtooth and Splinter backends use stable platforms. A Grid UI is now available for Products.

# Questions/Issues for the TSC

There are no specific issues at the moment.

# Release

No prior releases.

# Overall Activity in the Past Quarter

Much of the activity has centered around Product UI development. The approach taken is modular so that the UI can be consumed as a component in an application which uses Grid as its underlying platform.

The remaining activity was keeping pace with Splinter development and eventual switch to Splinter 0.4.

The main source of engagement is still the Hyperledger Chat [#grid channel](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/grid).

# Current Plans

With the completion of the Product feature, future initiatives are currently being planned.

A likely avenue of development is to make Grid more consumable for applications using it, based on feedback being received.

There is work happening in Transact around smart contract APIs which we would like to adopt in Grid as it becomes available.

# Maintainer Diversity

The list of active maintainers for Hyperledger Grid currently remains unchanged.

We anticipate adding additional maintainers as contributions increase for areas currently in development.

# Contributor Diversity

Sponsoring organizations that are actively contributing to Grid include Cargill, Target, GS1, and Bitwise IO.
