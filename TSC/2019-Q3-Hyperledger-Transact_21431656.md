# Technical Oversight Committee : 2019 Q3 Hyperledger Transact

Created by Mark Ford, last modified by Arnaud J LE HORS on Aug 29, 2019

## Project

Hyperledger Transact - [https://github.com/hyperledger/transact](https://github.com/hyperledger/transact)

## Project Health

Health is good. There is a surprising level of interest in the project; we expected less interest as a library project, but are glad to the interest is high, which is encouraging for library projects in general. There are ongoing planning discussions about the path to support Transact by the various projects, including Fabric, Sawtooth, and Grid.

## Issues

No issues currently.

## Releases

Since project creation, the project has had 6 releases. The current release is 0.1.5. The releases are available on [crates.io](http://crates.io):Â

## Overall Activity in the Past Quarter

Much of the activity in the past quarter has focused on project setup and incremental improvements to the initial code base. The primary method of discussion is RocketChat.

## Current Plans

Next steps include:

- Add network transport support for smart contract engines (with transaction processor compatibility)
- Add Go SDK support (for smart contract engines and client batch/transaction creation)
- Expand Fabric integration details and support

## Maintainer Diversity

The maintainer diversity currently matches that of the initial project sponsor companies.

There has been additional interest in contributing to the Go SDK, which may lead to additional maintainers.

## Contributor Diversity

Similar to maintainer diversity, since active contributors are likely to become maintainers at this early stage.

## Additional Information

None.
