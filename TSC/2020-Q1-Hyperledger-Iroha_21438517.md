# Technical Oversight Committee : 2020 Q1 Hyperledger Iroha

Created by Sara Garifullina, last modified by Christopher Ferris on Feb 13, 2020

# Project

HL Iroha

Project Health

The last quarter was not a very active one from the code perspective although the chats are very much alive, we receive questions (and reply to them), and although there are not so many new contributors but there are new users who, we hope, might join as contributors someday. The atmosphere in the community is great. Burrow integration is almost completed. Talked to Explorer maintainers and working closely with them to add Iroha support into their master branch. 

We also started collecting ideas for new versions of Iroha – to make it better. 

A book was published in Japan about HL Iroha ![(smile)](images/icons/emoticons/smile.png)

# Questions/Issues for the TSC

We do not seem to have many questions at this point. 

# Releases

We did not have releases in this period (since we've been preparing the 1.2 with tricky integrations). 

Last release was [Release 1.1.1](https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/releases/tag/1.1.1) on 20th of September

# Overall Activity in the Past Quarter

Code-wise, we've been concentrating mostly on ITF, testing and finishing integrations with Ursa (as it is only possible now to build the project with it – we want it to be also applied in the runtime) and Burrow (lots of testing required as it is a difficult project to add). Chats are active, we might get more attention as a big project on Iroha was announced publicly. 

Another thing that happened is that we changed the schedule of calls - now they are bi-weekly and start earlier.  

# Current Plans

We are planning 1.2 release (maybe with 1.1.2 first) – it will include the final version of Burrow integration and an audit is planned for it. Also, we are collecting requirements and ideas for new releases (if you have any, let us know!). Also, we are preparing our maintainer, [Andrei Lebedev](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/557058:c02f1b3d-42e6-4519-ba84-2d0476dccbc9?ref=confluence) for HGF, so he could talk about Iroha there. 

# Maintainer Diversity

Alexander Lednev joined us (iceseer on GitHub)

# Contributor Diversity

We've got a contribution from claudiocandio as a new contributor.

Still looking for more contributors. 

# Additional Information

No additional information, it seems. 

UPDATE from 13th of February: we also fixed Iroha SDK for Caliper and waiting for a review: [https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper/pull/726](https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper/pull/726)
