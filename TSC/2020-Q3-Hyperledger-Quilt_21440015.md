# Technical Oversight Committee : 2020 Q3 Hyperledger Quilt

Created by David Fuelling, last modified by Gari Singh on Sep 17, 2020

# Project

Hyperledger [Quilt](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/quilt/Hyperledger+Quilt)

Project Health

Project health over Q3 has been OK. We had one dot-release of the library ([v1.3.1](https://github.com/hyperledger/quilt/releases/tag/v1.3.1)) that added some minor debugging output and fixed some issues with our CI. No new contributors or maintainers joined the project during this quarter but we maintained the same core group of contributors.

# Questions/Issues for the TSC

There are no issues at this time.

# Releases

Quilt had one release in Q3:

- Quilt [v1.3.1](https://github.com/hyperledger/quilt/releases/tag/v1.3.1): Debugging improvements and CI improvements.

# Overall Activity in the Past Quarter

Activity was low this past quarter because the core dev team was focused on non-Interledger activity due to shifting priorities in their day-jobs. We hope to spend more ILP-focused time in Q4, including enhancements to Quilt.

# Current Plans

The team is currently working to productionalize the [Java Connector](https://connector.interledger4j.dev/), which the Hyperledger Quilt library powers. We plan to introduce improvements to the STREAM protocol support in the library, as well as minor bug-fixes and improvements.

We also plan to gather feedback at the HL Maintainers summit and see how this might affect the roadmap for this library.

# Maintainer Diversity

Maintainer diversity is unchanged.

# Contributor Diversity

Contributor diversity is unchanged.

# Additional Information

Not at this time.
