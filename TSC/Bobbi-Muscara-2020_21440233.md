### Short Personal Pitch

The Hyperledger community is the most innovative and creative group of people in the industry. By working together, we can bring Hyperledger's cutting edge technology to maturity so that enterprises, governments, and educational communities can benefit. As a community builder I understand the importance of educating the members to make it easier for developers and decision makers to feel comfortable contributing. As a member of the Technical Steering Committee I will make it my mission to encourage projects to explore new avenues with cross collaboration, organization and effective communication.

I believe in the Hyperledger message, where different ideas are encouraged to sprout up in an all-inclusive greenhouse model. I would be humbled and honored to be considered for this new role in the Hyperledger Community. If elected to the TSC I would be a committed to developing a strong technical community that leads in the adoption of Hyperledger umbrella projects and building an amazing global community.
