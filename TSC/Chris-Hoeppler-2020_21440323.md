# Short personal bio

Since joiningÂ [Bosch Research](https://www.bosch.com/research/) seven years ago I have been working on a wide range of open source topics from compliance to strategy. Currently, I focus on working with internal teams to help with their open source contributions both within Bosch Research as its Open Source Officer and beyond as part of Bosch's corporate open source expert team. Additionally, I am a member of the strategic research project "[Economy of Things](https://www.bosch.com/research/updates/economy-of-things/)", which is working towards well-governed decentralized systems for a digital economy.

# Short personal pitch

In the last view months we've turned from passive member to active contributor by starting two Hyperledger Labs projects:

- [Perun](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/hyperledger-labs.github.io/blob/master/labs/perun.md), a blockchain-agnostic state channels framework, and
- Business Partner Agent ([https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/business-partner-agent](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/business-partner-agent)), an application of Aries to manage organization identities.

Both are extending current technology within the Hyperledger Greenhouse, and show how it could evolve in the future:

- adding further basis technological building blocks which fit to or extend current Hyperledger technology (e.g. a second-layer protocol such as Perun state channels)
- adding lighthouse projects to support enterprise integration (such as Business Partner Agent)

If elected to the TSC I would bring this view to the discussion on how to further evolve Hyperledger. Also, the on-boarding experience to Hyperledger labs was a very positive one (thanks to the Hyperledger Labs Stewards and our sponsors!). With the fresh experience of a new contributor I'd be honored to work with the other members of the TSC on keeping Hyperledger as welcoming a community as I experienced it and make it even stronger.

Thank you.
