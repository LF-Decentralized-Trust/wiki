# Technical Oversight Committee : Rollover of projects tied to a single other project

# Overview of Proposal

According to the resolution of [Subprojects and project proposals](Subprojects-and-project-proposals_21437620.html), "A new project proposal that is a feature unique to an existing project will be guided to that existing community to see about joining it." This resolution lets proposals that aim at supporting or being used by several other projects to stand on their own. However, sometimes, for various reasons and possibly despite all the goodwill of the community involved, the project never meets that goal and ends up being tied to a single other project, within Hypeledger and beyond.

There are several costs associated with "top level projects": they are prominently featured on the Hyperledger website, they benefit from communication services, security audits, etc, and the large number of Hyperledger projects and their unobvious dependencies is confusing.

The proposal is therefore to have projects that had the ambition to serve or support several other projects but are effectively only used in conjunction with a single other project be rolled into that related project after 18 months. It should be noted that this is similar to what was done for several Fabric related projects per the resolution of [Subprojects house keeping](Subprojects-house-keeping_21437592.html).

# Formal Proposal(s)

Projects that have been in Incubation for over 18 months and are effectively tied to a single other project, with no immediate prospect of this situation changing, will be considered by the TSC for a rollover into that other project. The final decision will be made by the TSC after due consideration of the specific case at hand and communication with the maintainers of both projects involved.
