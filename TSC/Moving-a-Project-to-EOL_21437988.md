# Overview of Proposal

See [Project Lifecycle Task Force Issue 1](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/TF/pages/20873418/Issue+1+When+do+we+know+that+a+project+is+done+What+are+the+end-of-life+criteria) Resolution 1.2

# Formal Proposal(s)

Project Maintainers may submit to the TSC a request for moving their project to EOL. Pending TSC approval, a notification will be sent out to the project mailing list that the project is being moved to "Deprecated" status and effectively placed on the path to EOL. After 6 months have passed, if no one has objected, pending TSC approval, the project will effectively be moved to EOL.
