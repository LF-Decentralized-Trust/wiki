# Technical Oversight Committee : Gari Singh 2020

Created by Gari Singh, last modified by Ry Jones on Aug 19, 2021

### Nominated By

Self

### Short personal bio

I am an IBM Distinguished Engineer and the CTO for Blockchain.  I run the offering management and development teams for IBM Blockchain as well as our contributions to Hyperledger Fabric.  I am also a maintainer for and contributor to Hyperledger Fabric and a current member of the TSC.

### Short personal pitch

I've been part of Hyperledger since it was founded back in late 2015 / early 2016.  I started out as a contributor and reviewer for Hyperledger Fabric and eventually became a maintainer.  I've participated in multiple community events over the years and have attended and spoken at almost every member summit.  I'm very active on the mailing list and Stack Overflow and enjoy helping people use and learn Hyperledger technologies.  As the CTO for Blockchain at IBM, I get to work directly with many customers and prospects on their blockchain journeys, learning new requirements along the way.

In 2019, I decided to run for the TSC in order to help provide technical guidance across the entire community rather than focusing solely on Fabric.  I've really enjoyed working with the other TSC members and hope to make the TSC even more technical in the coming year!
