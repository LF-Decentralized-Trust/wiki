# Short personal pitch

As an industry practitioner, I want to help craft "lighter" Hyperledger DLT technologies - designed for high Throughput systems -  like Burrow or Iroha  - to be more production-ready.

Having had a bad experience with an Iroha roll-out for tayara.tn, I was quite frustrated as the initial value proposition was promising: a DLT with decent response time, geared towards mortal developers ![(smile)](images/icons/emoticons/smile.png)

So I want to bring to the table my expertise in software architecture, data engineering, and the privileged insights that I have as a major eCommerce / marketplace operator, so we can make this dream of light DLTs for the masses happen ![(smile)](images/icons/emoticons/smile.png)

Thanks,

Rafik Naccache
