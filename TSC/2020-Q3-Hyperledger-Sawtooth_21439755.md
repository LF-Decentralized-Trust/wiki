# Technical Oversight Committee : 2020 Q3 Hyperledger Sawtooth

Created by Andi Gunderson, last modified by Gari Singh on Sep 17, 2020

# Project

Hyperledger Sawtooth [https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/](https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/)

Project Health

The primary focus of the last quarter was starting to work in earnest on the next generation of Sawtooth. This marks a return to active development on the core platform.

The Sawtooth community is actively engaging in live, public working sessions to decide Sawtooth's future. Some community members have expressed interest in contributing to new Sawtooth features, and others have promised to contribute enhancements and features that are not yet open source.

# Questions/Issues for the TSC

No new issues.

# Releases

- Sawtooth Core v1.2.5 - 7/1/2020
- Sawtooth Rust SDK v0.4.4 - 5/5/2020

# Overall Activity in the Past Quarter

The community continues to discuss Sawtooth-related issues on Rocketchat and the mailing list. Live working sessions have also been used on a semi-regular basis to discuss the future of Sawtooth, with strong participation from the community.

Development on the core platform has substantially picked up with a number of code contributions. The following key work has been completed in the Sawtooth codebase:

- The majority of the Rust code has been moved from the validator in the sawtooth-core repository to the sawtooth library in the new sawtooth-lib repository. This is the first big step toward the next major version of Sawtooth.
- The Transact compatibility feature (\`transact-compat\`) was stabilized and made available for the Sawtooth Rust SDK v0.4.4 release. This moves Sawtooth another step closer to fully adopting Hyperledger Transact.
- A major bug in the validator that was affecting the decoding of state values in some edge cases was fixed and released with Sawtooth v1.2.5.
- Building and linting has been enhanced by the addition of a justfile to the sawtooth-core and sawtooth-sdk-rust repositories.

# Current Plans

Plans will continue to be developed as part of the working sessions.

The following work is currently planned:

- Replace the direct use and export of protobufs in the Sawtooth library with protocol structs written in Rust
- Replace the Transaction Execution Platform (TEP) implementation in the Sawtooth validator with Hyperledger Transact
- Initialize a Sawtooth service for Splinter
- Move portions of Sawtooth Sabre to Hyperledger Transact

Maintainers are investigating options for defining some easy-to-get-started work to attract a wider set of low-volume contributors.

# Maintainer Diversity

Maintainers are distributed across [Bitwise](http://bitwise.io/) IO, Cargill, Intel, and Walmart Labs.
