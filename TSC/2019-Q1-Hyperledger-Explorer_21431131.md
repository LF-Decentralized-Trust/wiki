Project Health

Project health is green. We released Tags v0.3.8 in support of Fabric 1.3 and 0.3.9 in support of Fabric 1.4. We use all of the following to help keep project health green: JIRA, RocketChat, email, Gerrit, Jenkins, Github, Zoom andÂ Skype. Questions asked via rocketchat are being answered in a timely manner. For greater efficiency in this regard the FAQs page is updated with every release. Good mix of background of contributors from front-end to back-end however more community involvement is strongly encouraged and welcomed!
