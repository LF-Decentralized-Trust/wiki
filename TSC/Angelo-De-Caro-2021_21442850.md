# Short personal pitch

Being a member of the Hyperledger TSC in the past two years gave me the great opportunity to contribute from a very privileged position. I want to thanks the community and the TSC members for the great work done in these years, despite the difficult moments we have all experienced. I learned a lot from all of you.  
It is with this spirit of gratitude, respect, and compassion that I ask the votes of the community to be confirmed as TSC member.  
Together, we can run the extra miles that:

- Will keep Hyperledger the point of reference for enterprise blockchain;
- Will see maturing Interoperability technologies;
- Will push to the limits our knowledge and our desire to make the difference.

Thanks,  
Angelo De Caro
