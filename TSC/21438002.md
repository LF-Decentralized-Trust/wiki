# Overview of Proposal

# Formal Proposal(s)

All major releases must fulfill the same requirements as those for the First Major Release, in accordance with [SemVer](https://semver.org/).

All releases (both major and minor) should document how an upgrade can be deployed.

For major releases where there is a breaking change or minor releases that add new functionality, documentation to migrate from the previous minor version of the previous major version should be provided.
