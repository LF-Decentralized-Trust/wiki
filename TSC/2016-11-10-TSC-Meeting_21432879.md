**Agenda**

- Action Item Review
- Sawtooth Lake: Marketplace Navigator has been added to the sawtooth-core [repository](https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-core/tree/master/extensions/mktplace/navigator). (Dan Middleton)
- HIP:  Cello (Baohua Yang)

**Action Item Review**

- Cancel 11/24 TSC meeting due to US Thanksgiving)
- - No objections.
- 11/17 TSC meeting -- Chris and Brian are both out.  Does another TSC member want to run the meeting?
- - Please let us know via email.
- December Hackfest - still searching for a host/venue for December 5th &amp; 6th
- - Getting clarity on 2 final venue options by Tuesday EOD, otherwise we will need to cancel the December Hackfest -- unless folks here have options to provide.  Please get in touch ASAP if so.
- TSC and technical community to review [Project Incubation Exit Criteria](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.netcommunity/project-incubation-exit-criteria) and make any pertinent updates to be able to come to consensus on November 10th TSC meeting.
- - Questions raised that code review is probably not best way to asses security, need some other way to state a security/crypto analysis.  Need a framework in place to be able to analyze security.
  - Don’t want excessive requirements before something exits incubation, find some level of middle ground.
  - Brian noted that Hyperledger is looking to hire a Security Maven to help with this process.
  - Comment was made that there is a struggle with notion of “project” maturity level as opposed to “product” maturity level.  Exit criteria is really a way to determine that it is a functioning community, not that code is bulletproof and getting into product maturity.
  - Suggestion made to drop “additional requirements” portion of document.
  - Projects \_should_ be thinking about that section, but not have it set up as a barrier.  Maybe rename it as “additional considerations”
  - Move additional discussion on this topic to TSC list, look to take a vote next week.
- China Technical WG update
- - No update -- coming soon.
  - A suggestion was made to have a mechanism to prevent any fracturing of the global Community.
- Internship Program
- - Potential interest to sponsor and pay for 6 Hyperledger interns, similar to [https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/Interns](https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/Interns).
  - TSC and technical community responded to this with positive support.
  - - Potential mentors:  Dan to find someone from STL, Mark Wagner to find mentors at Red Hat, Leonard Edwin to help, as well.
    - If you are interested in being a mentor, please let us know.

**Sawtooth Lake: Marketplace Navigator has been added to the sawtooth-core** [**repository**](https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-core/tree/master/extensions/mktplace/navigator)**. (Dan Middleton)**

- MarketPlace Navigator is a hosted UI for the MarketPlace Transaction Family. It consists of three major pieces: a single page app, a server backend, and a syncing tool for synchronizing block state with the navigator's database.
- The single page app is a ClojureScript app (with some plain JavaScript dependencies), which provides client-side transaction signing capabilities. A user of the system generates a WIF key in the browser, which they can save locally. A user can create most MarketPlace objects via the UI, including participants, assets, holdings and sell offers.
- The server is a Node.js application, which uses RethinkDB for its storage needs. It provides API's to create richer representation of the marketplace objects, in order to improve the user experience. It also acts as a pass-through for transactions being submitted to a validator. Any transaction successfully submitted will be recorded, giving history of any failures that may occur during block construction.
- The synchronization tool is a python script that bridges the gap between block store contents and a RethinkDB database instance. It reads block deltas from a validator, and creates block store snapshots, essentially providing an immutable history of the block state.

**HIP:  Cello (Baohua Yang)**

- [proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1E2i5GRqWsIag7KTxjQ_jQdDiWcuikv3KqXeuw7NaceM) &amp; [existing code](https://github.com/yeasy/cello)
- Discussion [recording](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B42vMkapQi1MNVhlak1BbnNJcnc)
- Additional Q&amp;A to be moved to TSC mailing list, plan to revisit at 11/17 TSC meeting.

**Actions/On-going**

- December Hackfest / go or no-go by EOD Tuesday (November 15th)
- Both Brian and Chris will be out on 11/17 -- can another TSC member facilitate?  Will there be enough TSC members for quorum?
- [Project Incubation Exit Criteria](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.netcommunity/project-incubation-exit-criteria) -- please move additional discussion/questions to TSC list, looking to take a vote at the next TSC meeting
- Internship Program -- if you are interested in being a mentor for an intern, please let us know (this will launch sometime next year)
- China Technical WG planning
- HIP:  Cello (Baohua Yang) -- please move additional discussion/questions to TSC list, looking to take a vote at the next TSC meeting (if TSC is ready)
