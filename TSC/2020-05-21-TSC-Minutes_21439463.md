### Announcements

None

### Items of discussion

- [Common Maintainers management policy](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/display/TSC/Common+Maintainers+management+policy)
  
  - [https://github.com/hyperledger/tsc/pull/1](https://github.com/hyperledger/tsc/pull/1)
  - [https://github.com/hyperledger/tsc/pull/1/files#r421520801](https://github.com/hyperledger/tsc/pull/1/files#r421520801)
    
    - Should the policy be included in the MAINTAINER's file?
    - Important to be able to find the policy governing the file.
    - A link is also fine.
    - Merged.
- Port of governing docs from wiki
  
  - [https://github.com/hyperledger/tsc/pull/3](https://github.com/hyperledger/tsc/pull/3)
  - Can we pull this into our wiki from Github? Just want to make sure it is included in our search.
  - It was a direct port.
  - The point of this exercise is to consolidate the documentation and to update it.
- House cleaning
  
  - [Project Proposals](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/display/TSC/Project+Proposals)
  - Found some proposals that were not properly tagged and without the TSC review list.
    
    - Multi-language documentation is now over on github: close.
    - No-code development platform: continue discussion on wiki page.
    - Solang Solidity compiler: on hold for now.
- Proposed 2020 TSC Election Plan
  
  - August 16 - August 31: Run the eligibility scripts daily to gather the email addresses of contributors.
  - August 31:
    
    - Launch web service to check emails and link email addresses.
    - Publish email template for submitting nominations to the TSC.
  - October 1:
    
    - Formally announce the slate of candidates.
  - October 4 - 10:
    
    - Voting via Condorcet
  - October 11:
    
    - Publish results
  - Questions:
    
    - What is the cutoff date for eligibility for running/voting for 2020 election? August 31?
    - Should we split up the voting over a two week period to maximize the opportunity for people to vote? It would still be seven days total just three days one week and four days the next?
    - Does this plan outline the process by which the chair and vice chair are selected and when?
    - What is the official term for the incoming TSC? When do they start?
      
      - There needs to be a transition period after the election results are published but before the new TSC term so that incoming members can elect the new chair/vice and get on the mailing list and in general figure out which way is up.
      - This plan is to publish results on October 10th.
        
        - One possible plan:
          
          - Give TSC members until the 15th to decide if they want to run for chair/vice.
          - Have joint old-new TSC meeting on the 15th.
          - Chair/vice election from the 15th - 22nd.
          - New TSC takes over on October 22nd.
        - Another:
          
          - Chair/vice decision and admin transition time from 10th - 22nd.
          - Joint old-new TSC meeting on the 22nd.
          - Chair/vice election from 22nd - 28th.
          - New TSC takes over on November 1st.
