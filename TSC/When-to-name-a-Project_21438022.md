See [Project Lifecycle Task Force Issue 7](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/TF/pages/20873533/Issue+7+How+when+does+a+project+get+officially+named)

# Formal Proposal(s)

To start, a proposal should come with a temporary "code name" (e.g. a geographical location) that can be used for the repository with low risk of trademark violation. On approval, the marketing committee will work with the proposers to create a long term name and will do all the necessary checks. The repository name can be changed.propo
