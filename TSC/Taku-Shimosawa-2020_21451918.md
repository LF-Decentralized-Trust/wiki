# Short personal bio

I am a researcher in blockchain at Hitachi and Hitachi America since 2017. I received a Ph.D. in Computer Science at the University of Tokyo in Japan.

I have been working primarily on Hyperledger Fabric; I am a contributor to Hyperledger Fabric, a proposer and committer of Blockchain Verifier (a Hyperledger Labs project), and a maintainer of Japanese Documentation Translation Group for Hyperledger Fabric. I also presented several times in Hyperledger Hackfests and also introduced the projects in the meetups in Tokyo.

Prior to working on Hyperledger Fabric, I was working on systems software including Linux and other operating systems, and joined Linux-related projects such as AGL and SIL2LinuxMP.

# Short personal pitch

As an active contributor to Hyperledger projects, and with my expertise as an industrial researcher, I think I am eligible to serve the Hyperledger community as a member of TSC.

When I am elected as a TSC member, I would like to help Hyperledger to be more user-friendly and widely adopted, and also to extend the community further so that it gains more diversity, such as the Fabric international documentation project being widely expanded by many international users and translators.
