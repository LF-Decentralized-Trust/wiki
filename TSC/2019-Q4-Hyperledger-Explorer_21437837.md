Project Health

Project health is green. We released Tag  v1.0.0-rc1 on November 18 . We use all of the following to help keep project health green: JIRA, RocketChat, email, Gerrit, Jenkins, Github, Zoom and Skype. Questions asked via rocketchat are being answered in a timely manner. For greater efficiency in this regard the FAQs page is updated with every release. We are in need of more community involvement to maintain a green status for the project.

# Issues

# Overall Activity in the Past Quarter

In this quarter the focus was on earning [CII Badge](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/en/projects/2710)**,** transitioning to [Azure Pipeline](https://dev.azure.com/Hyperledger/blockchain-explorer/_build), and [GitHub code review](https://github.com/hyperledger/blockchain-explorer) (Gerrit available in read only mode), fixing bugs, enhancing UI, creating as a step toward getting out of incubation. In support of that we worked on increasing code coverage and putting in place an E2E Test Suite and added documentation for HL Explorer [here](https://blockchain-explorer.readthedocs.io/en/master).

Automated deployment of HL Explorer is available [Running in Docker](https://github.com/hyperledger/blockchain-explorer#Run-Hyperledger-Explorer-using-Docker).
