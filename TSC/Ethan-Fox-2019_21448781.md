# Short personal bio

I graduated from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in 2017 with a degree in Computer Science, and I have been a software developer in the Blockchain Innovation Unit within IBM Global Business Services (GBS) since February 2018. As a member of IBM Blockchain I have had the opportunity to coordinate with clients to drive technical discussions around applications of blockchain for enterprise, and develop numerous applications that integrate chaincode and the Fabric SDK. In May of this year I joined our Golden State Foods engagement, which we are leveraging with IBM Food Trust to develop an Inventory and Waste Management platform for more visibility into their supply chain.

# Short personal pitch

As a member of IBM Blockchain for the last 18 months, I have built applications on Hyperledger Fabric for a wide array of use cases. I have participated in numerous consortium exploratory workshops as an advocate for Fabric, so I am well-versed in how Fabric can help our clients &amp; end users succeed in their goals. As a member of the Technical Steering committee, I feel that my input would be valuable as an everyday user of the Fabric ecosystem and my experiences would provide valuable insight as to how best to allocate resources towards improving our blockchain offering.
