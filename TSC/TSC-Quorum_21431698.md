RESOLVEDÂ 

**Outcome**Any TSC member who fails to attend two consecutive TSC meetings will not be counted for purposes of determining quorum requirements as of the third consecutive meeting and until they next attend a TSC meeting.**Minutes Link**[2019 10 03 TSC Minutes](2019-10-03-TSC-Minutes_21434786.html)

Should the quorum rules be adjusted, such that if you don't make it to some number of calls, your vote is removed and the vote for quorum goes down by one? If so, how do you earn your vote back?
