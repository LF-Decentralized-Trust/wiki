# Technical Oversight Committee : 2021 Q3 Hyperledger Grid

Created by Darian Plumb, last modified by Gari Singh on Oct 16, 2021

# Project Health

Health is good. Finished roadmap items for release 0.2, and roadmap items for release 0.3 are in-progress (including Purchase Order). 

# Required Information

1. [Have you switched from master to main in all your repos](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/TSC/Projects+have+two+quarters+to+comply+with+common+repo+structure?focusedCommentId=21452776)? Yes
2. [Have you implemented the Common Repository Structure in all your repos](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/TSC/Common+Repo+structure)? No

# Questions/Issues for the TSC

There are no specific issues at the moment. 

# Releases

Grid 0.2 is released.

# Overall Activity in the Past Quarter

The Product v2 functionality was added and the feature was stabilized. This new version includes functionality for adding products based around the GS1 GDSN standard. 

Several features were stabilized: 

- Location
- Pike
- Product
- Schema
- Postgres support
- Sqlite support

Started work on the Purchase Order smart contract. This includes functionality for managing a purchase order throughout its lifecycle for agents involved in the purchasing and selling process. 

Continued work on the Workflow functionality. This module contains functionality for managing state transitions within smart contracts that map to steps in a business workflow. 

Work towards stabilizing Grid features continues. 

The main source of asynchronous engagement is still the Hyperledger Chat [#grid channel](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/grid) and RFC PRs. 

# Current Plans

Current work is focused on working towards Purchase Order design and implementation which will be in the 0.3 release. We are also continuing to design and implement functionality to make integration with external systems easier. 

# Maintainer Diversity

Maintainers remain the same as the previous quarter. There are 19 maintainers across the different repos. 

# Contributor Diversity

Contributor diversity remains steady with previous quarters, with some share of the project's overall diversity coming from non-developer participation in their areas of expertise. 

Sponsoring organizations that are actively contributing to Grid include Cargill, Target, GS1, and Bitwise IO. Additional contributions come from individual contributors. 

We have two new contributors since the last update.
