00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:37.080
Tracy Kuhrt: As you all, probably are aware, although we do have a couple guests today and welcome to our guest you, there are two things that you have to abide by.

52
00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:49.350
Tracy Kuhrt: The TC meetings, the first one is the antitrust policy notice, which is displayed on the screen and the second one is our code of conduct, which is linked in the agenda.

53
00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:53.310
Tracy Kuhrt: So with that we'll hit the announcements.

54
00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:55.470
Tracy Kuhrt: As always.

55
00:09:56.610 --> 00:10:01.620
Tracy Kuhrt: In the announcements we have the Dev weekly developer newsletter that goes out each Friday.

56
00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:13.170
Tracy Kuhrt: If you are interested in including anything in that Dev weekly newsletter there is a link on the agenda to a wiki page where you can add your comments.

57
00:10:13.650 --> 00:10:24.210
Tracy Kuhrt: for inclusion in the in the Dev weekly newsletter so feel free to add anything that you might have about your particular project or.

58
00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:37.200
Tracy Kuhrt: Anything that's interesting going on, specifically in your Community or working group or sig anything that you would like to have highlighted to reach the community of hyper ledger developers.

59
00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:53.550
Tracy Kuhrt: The second announcement that we have here is just a reminder that next week and the following weeks meetings are canceled due to the end of your holidays, we will pick up the meetings, the first week in January and.

60
00:10:55.800 --> 00:11:07.590
Tracy Kuhrt: Obviously enjoy the time off enjoy the meteor and that's the announcements that are listed here does anybody else have any announcements that they would like to make.

61
00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:12.390
Ry Jones: i'm going to say there's one more.

62
00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:15.510
Ry Jones: 14 Daniela has an announcement, I see a room.

63
00:11:15.810 --> 00:11:17.490
Ry Jones: raises hand so room.

64
00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:34.350
Aruna S M: hey probably it's not an announcement it's just a heads up because next couple of weeks we're not going to have a call if we had and maybe a few people who are joined and updated it so so some of the six and and.

65
00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:43.050
Aruna S M: The chapters, we are planning to collaborate across and run a long running hyper ledger challenge it's it's a.

66
00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:56.670
Aruna S M: it's going to be a long running challenge not exactly a hackathon we The goal is to have more open source contributions and then bring in more people contributing in hyper ledger and also bring in new projects into labs.

67
00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:06.240
Aruna S M: So that's an heads up if you have some more details will be shared across over an email, and also, it will be shared across in coming weeks.

68
00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:21.810
Aruna S M: And if you have any needs within your projects or, if you have needs let's say within some of your cigs that you participate, please bring in those problem statements and this challenge, so that's the right, so thank you.

69
00:12:23.490 --> 00:12:24.330
Tracy Kuhrt: Good thanks right.

70
00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:32.820
Tracy Kuhrt: So another way to get the additional contributors to the your projects your six year working groups your labs.

71
00:12:34.050 --> 00:12:36.120
Tracy Kuhrt: anybody else have any announcements they'd like to make.

72
00:12:40.350 --> 00:12:44.220
Ry Jones: Well, Daniel hasn't unmuted so there's there's Danielle go ahead.

79
00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:47.220
Tracy Kuhrt: Right great thanks for that in Sean really glad to see you again and welcome to the Community architecture role.

80
00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:50.610
Tracy Kuhrt: anybody else have any announcements they'd like to make.

81
00:13:56.760 --> 00:14:09.570
Tracy Kuhrt: Okay, so, with no more announcements we will head to the quarterly reports, as you can see, we have a couple of reports that are outstanding overdue.

82
00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:13.380
Tracy Kuhrt: We did get in the firefly.

83
00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:14.700
Report.

84
00:14:16.170 --> 00:14:26.880
Tracy Kuhrt: which, from what I could see I didn't necessarily have any questions or comments that need to be addressed, we do still have.

85
00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:40.440
Tracy Kuhrt: looks like about six people who haven't yet reviewed the the report so definitely if you're a tlc Member don't forget, there are a number of reports that you need your reviews, so if you.

86
00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:54.780
Tracy Kuhrt: You know, would take the time to do that, that would be greatly appreciated by the projects are there any questions that didn't get addressed or add it to the firefly report that needs to be addressed.

87
00:15:03.990 --> 00:15:04.140
Tracy Kuhrt: well.

88
00:15:06.210 --> 00:15:22.320
Kamlesh Nagware: So in the firefly report, I think, maintenance diversity is only the one company now, so what is the plan of the mentors project mentor to going to increase their option or maybe increase the diversity of the developers.

89
00:15:26.430 --> 00:15:28.770
Tracy Kuhrt: it's a good question I.

90
00:15:28.890 --> 00:15:39.390
Tracy Kuhrt: don't see that we have anybody from firefly on the call I would recommend, adding that question to the report, to see if we can get some answers back.

91
00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:42.390
Tracy Kuhrt: Probably.

92
00:15:43.710 --> 00:15:52.260
Bobbi Muscara: hi I know that, through the giving chain project we took a break, when the mentorship program was over, and we intend to come back.

93
00:15:52.770 --> 00:16:02.190
Bobbi Muscara: In the New Year and help I know the mentees are definitely ready to get started again helping the firefly people, so I believe that they will become contributors to firefly in January.

94
00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:10.530
Tracy Kuhrt: I think I think the question is more around the maintainer looking at the contributor diversity report.

95
00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:29.460
Tracy Kuhrt: That was added by linking to the effects insights I did see that there was a 25% increase of contributors over the past three months, but I do think the question around hundred percent collider maintainer is is a is a question that we.

96
00:16:31.050 --> 00:16:40.560
Tracy Kuhrt: You know, should should pose to the firefly community and definitely work towards increasing that diversity.

97
00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:44.730
Bobbi Muscara: Or maybe one of the mentees one day will be a maintainer is.

98
00:16:44.730 --> 00:16:45.480
Tracy Kuhrt: My yo.

99
00:16:48.750 --> 00:16:51.870
Tracy Kuhrt: that's how you start start as a contributor work your way up.

100
00:16:54.570 --> 00:17:00.330
Tracy Kuhrt: Okay, any other any other questions or comments that we should make sure we're adjusting to the firefly community.

101
00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:08.880
David Boswell: yeah as far as that goes NICO did share on the meditators list this week or presentation that they put together about their Community building efforts so far.

102
00:17:09.570 --> 00:17:16.560
David Boswell: And I do believe in there, he flags that finding and you know, bringing new maintainer is on is a challenge, so just one thought for us is.

103
00:17:17.070 --> 00:17:29.490
David Boswell: What sort of guidance from from the more mature projects are there tips or suggestions or ideas like do we have like a best practice guide for perhaps finding containers that could be a thing to think about you know what.

104
00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:36.300
David Boswell: If they're raising their hand and saying yeah we really want some but it's a challenge, how do we want to you know guide them, perhaps.

105
00:17:38.730 --> 00:17:48.630
Tracy Kuhrt: Sure, is anybody have any thoughts on that, from the perspective of how they have added mean cleaners to their existing projects.

106
00:17:53.700 --> 00:18:00.210
Tracy Kuhrt: and compassionate it okay thanks I was I wasn't shake your hand was up to answer that or if you had a follow up there.

107
00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:04.200
Kamlesh Nagware: So I think to raise my hands.

108
00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:12.390
Kamlesh Nagware: So yeah so to increase the diversity, maybe like it was just a example of the marketing automation framework.

109
00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:27.810
Kamlesh Nagware: They extended the competitors and contributors in the very short time in the early if Clyde Clyde Oh, and the other five like team, maybe do some to season, to be involved, the Community.

110
00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:39.060
Kamlesh Nagware: Talk to the SI geez or regional chapters do some kind of workshops to get the more involvement to the project there's a business plan from there.

111
00:18:40.770 --> 00:18:49.440
Tracy Kuhrt: Okay anybody else have any ideas or suggestions that we can offer to project, since they want to increase their maintainer diversity.

112
00:19:02.970 --> 00:19:11.400
Aruna S M: A probably one good thing about firefly report, at least for the last quarter has been from the elephants and site it's just that.

113
00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:19.800
Aruna S M: 3% or maybe three people have disengage themselves from the contributors, and there is increase of 25.

114
00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:29.550
Aruna S M: And at the same time, so there is some engagement from the contributors so it's not one of contributions that we are saying for outside collider.

115
00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:38.790
Aruna S M: But it's still a question that we need to get through them and ask them what is the timeframe that they are looking for from an external engagement point of view.

116
00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:59.790
Aruna S M: For them to be considered as a maintainer and in terms of PRS count that elephants inside tells us it's close to 85% of PRS that are coming in from one organization, as opposed to 15% from rest of those 45% people coming in from different organizations.

117
00:20:01.530 --> 00:20:06.060
Aruna S M: Maybe that's another question that we can talk to them talk through them about.

118
00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:17.010
Tracy Kuhrt: yeah for sure, and I recall seeing on the DCI mailing list Karen you had sent out a report on.

119
00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:27.150
Tracy Kuhrt: In increasing diversity and inclusion amongst projects and David, I think your response back pulled out some of the pieces of that, and one of them was.

120
00:20:27.570 --> 00:20:40.830
Tracy Kuhrt: Making sure that project document the process by which people can become not only contributors, but maintain errs as well, and I think that's a really good point and maybe something.

121
00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:54.510
Tracy Kuhrt: That, I am not aware, one way or the other, whether or not firefly has that or which of our projects do have that but that's definitely something that I think was a worthwhile call out for us to you know.

122
00:20:55.710 --> 00:21:01.590
Tracy Kuhrt: Look at as a community to see about increasing diversity of both contributors and.

123
00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:15.570
David Boswell: yeah that's a really good point I don't know exactly what we would do, but maybe just reviewing and understanding, where that documentation exists and where it doesn't kind of maybe a mapping exercise could be a good point.

124
00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:16.410
Tracy Kuhrt: I could give us.

125
00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:21.300
David Boswell: Some direction about where maybe we could provide some support to fill some areas in.

126
00:21:22.770 --> 00:21:23.520
Tracy Kuhrt: yeah definitely.

127
00:21:27.270 --> 00:21:36.900
Tracy Kuhrt: Okay anything else, then on the quarterly reports, obviously we have now for that are outstanding.

128
00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:42.600
Tracy Kuhrt: That haven't yet been reported on, and then we have four that are coming up.

129
00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:46.620
Tracy Kuhrt: That will be looking at.

130
00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:54.240
Tracy Kuhrt: In the new year as well, so just just recognizing that if you are project.

131
00:21:55.530 --> 00:22:06.750
Tracy Kuhrt: maintain maintainer or community in the Community of these projects, letting them know that their reports or do is something that I think is important, and I know that Dan has been.

132
00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:14.910
Tracy Kuhrt: You know, reaching out to to these projects as well to try and get people to put their reports in so just a.

133
00:22:15.990 --> 00:22:19.710
Tracy Kuhrt: You know this is a lot of outstanding and guests quarterly reports that we have.

134
00:22:21.810 --> 00:22:37.650
Tracy Kuhrt: So with that we do have a decision on the list here before the TC number attendance of project meetings, the issue that was created last week.

135
00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:56.760
Tracy Kuhrt: By heart, I did not see any additional comments added to this so i'm going to assume that, based on that that everybody thinks that this is ready to go as is, but before we call this for vote i'd like to see if there's any discussion on this.

136
00:22:57.870 --> 00:23:01.560
Tracy Kuhrt: That maybe didn't get added into the issue that should have been added into the issue.

137
00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:17.760
Tracy Kuhrt: Alright, so see no hands, I think.

138
00:23:19.410 --> 00:23:21.660
Tracy Kuhrt: Do we have a motion to put this to vote.

139
00:23:22.530 --> 00:23:23.430
Nathan George: I move we vote.

140
00:23:24.210 --> 00:23:24.810
Nathan George: All right, thank.

141
00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:26.160
Tracy Kuhrt: You have a second.

142
00:23:29.850 --> 00:23:34.770
Tracy Kuhrt: hi I think there were a couple of seconds there I definitely heard Peter.

143
00:23:36.630 --> 00:23:41.670
Tracy Kuhrt: So let's go ahead and put this to vote um I did you want to.

144
00:23:43.650 --> 00:23:44.580
Tracy Kuhrt: Talk us through a vote.

145
00:23:46.380 --> 00:23:49.170
Ry Jones: Sure, I didn't think this really need to be a roll call vote, but.

146
00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:52.980
Ry Jones: If that's what you would like Troy.

147
00:23:56.640 --> 00:23:59.490
Ry Jones: Troy the matter before the tasc, how do you vote yay or nay.

148
00:24:02.910 --> 00:24:03.690
Ry Jones: I didn't hear about.

149
00:24:04.140 --> 00:24:06.180
Dave Enyeart: I don't think we need a roll call yeah.

150
00:24:07.230 --> 00:24:07.620
Ry Jones: me either.

151
00:24:09.390 --> 00:24:09.750
Tracy Kuhrt: You know.

152
00:24:10.830 --> 00:24:10.980
Tracy Kuhrt: The.

153
00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:14.910
Tracy Kuhrt: Reason i'm on a roll call is because i'm not seeing a lot of.

154
00:24:16.470 --> 00:24:25.500
Tracy Kuhrt: engagement from the tsp, and so I want to make sure that people are engaged in these conversations so i'm going to force a roll call guys.

155
00:24:26.010 --> 00:24:26.370
Ry Jones: Okay.

156
00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:29.820
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): I will start thinking make sense actually yeah that's a very good.

157
00:24:29.820 --> 00:24:42.060
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): Point Tracy because it does require us to actually do something here right it's, not just for you, but yes and your dog it's like no you're basically committing to you know.

158
00:24:43.410 --> 00:24:45.600
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): Basically, implement that plan so.

159
00:24:47.910 --> 00:24:50.700
Ry Jones: Okay i'm going to start over again at the bottom Troy.

160
00:24:59.580 --> 00:25:00.720
Ry Jones: How do you vote joy.

161
00:25:01.410 --> 00:25:01.830
Sorry.

162
00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:14.730
Troy Ronda: I apologize guys, I actually missed the VID the topic on this one i'm really sorry.

163
00:25:15.450 --> 00:25:18.030
Ry Jones: Okay, you can abstain, I mean.

164
00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:19.320
Troy Ronda: i'll abstain.

165
00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:20.910
Ry Jones: Okay Jersey.

166
00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:22.950
Ry Jones: Yes, Peter.

167
00:25:24.450 --> 00:25:25.080
Peter Somogyvari: Yes.

168
00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:25.800
Nathan.

169
00:25:26.820 --> 00:25:27.330
Nathan George: Yes.

170
00:25:27.510 --> 00:25:28.170
Ry Jones: Okay marsh.

171
00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:29.400
Yes.

172
00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:32.730
Ry Jones: It looks like Jim is still not here heart.

173
00:25:33.570 --> 00:25:35.010
Ry Jones: Yes, grace.

174
00:25:35.820 --> 00:25:37.200
Ry Jones: Yes, David.

175
00:25:38.130 --> 00:25:39.330
Ry Jones: Yes, no.

176
00:25:40.260 --> 00:25:41.310
Ry Jones: Yes, Bobby.

177
00:25:42.060 --> 00:25:42.540
Yes.

178
00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:44.460
Aruna S M: Yes.

179
00:25:46.890 --> 00:25:47.400
Artem Barger: Yes.

180
00:25:47.850 --> 00:25:48.270
Ry Jones: or no.

181
00:25:49.350 --> 00:25:51.270
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): Yes, century grits.

182
00:25:52.860 --> 00:26:02.850
Ry Jones: I know and Angelo is not here either, so we have the motion passes with one stain.

183
00:26:05.430 --> 00:26:10.260
Tracy Kuhrt: So in the new year, please at least one meeting.

184
00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:13.290
Tracy Kuhrt: per month attend.

185
00:26:14.730 --> 00:26:15.810
Tracy Kuhrt: As a TC Member.

186
00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:18.840
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): Real work.

187
00:26:19.860 --> 00:26:20.790
Tracy Kuhrt: yep exactly.

188
00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:36.720
Tracy Kuhrt: Alright, so the second item here is, in our discussions, we do have a draft that is out there again, I did not see any sort of comments showing up in this document this week.

189
00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:46.170
Tracy Kuhrt: For the services for graduated projects versus incubated projects versus labs, but I do want to make sure that if anybody has any.

190
00:26:46.590 --> 00:26:57.150
Tracy Kuhrt: comments that they would like to add anything that they see that's missing that they would like to make sure that is being provided by the hyper ledger stuff that that does get into this document.

191
00:27:03.330 --> 00:27:10.830
David Boswell: And plus one with Tracy said, we definitely do want some feedback, I mean if it doesn't happen to be feedback today, you know we can always you know have.

192
00:27:11.340 --> 00:27:19.590
David Boswell: Additional discussion going forward, but you know our goal with documenting this information or clearly is to make sure that projects on labs have.

193
00:27:19.980 --> 00:27:33.840
David Boswell: What the leaders of those projects and labs need to be successful, so you know that really requires input from you know the people involved to say hey This is something we do need and we don't have clarity about it or This is great, and you know.

194
00:27:35.580 --> 00:27:39.930
David Boswell: But the more feedback, I think the better on on this, so please, if you have thoughts, we live here.

195
00:27:41.250 --> 00:27:41.880
Tracy Kuhrt: Yes or no.

196
00:27:43.230 --> 00:27:49.950
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): Yes, so I went through the document earlier and I have to say I mean I didn't see anything that shocked me so that's the good news.

197
00:27:51.030 --> 00:28:02.520
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): You know I kind of wish that the document were built in a way, and so this brings a question to me is like you know I would expect levels to.

198
00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:07.620
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): To to kind of build on to one another, you know what I mean is like.

199
00:28:08.070 --> 00:28:22.050
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): I would imagine lab kind of the minimum and then you say or get incubating projects of everything the labs get plus those things, and the graduate of projects of everything being competing projects, plus those things but.

200
00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:29.880
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): You know the document was in deal that way and I felt like well if I say that I will say, well, thanks, but this is extra work and I wasn't.

201
00:28:30.540 --> 00:28:40.740
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): wanted to do the work, so I kind of Is it better to say it, but it fundamentally it also raises the question is that actually the cakes.

202
00:28:41.460 --> 00:28:53.040
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): Do do those you know, are those those levels do they exist do we have this kind of like increasing level of services, which I would expect, but maybe.

203
00:28:53.280 --> 00:29:02.700
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): isn't really like this, I don't know is there anything graduated project gets that an incubator project doesn't Oh, the other way around, but either right.

204
00:29:02.730 --> 00:29:03.720
Ry Jones: At the top of the list.

205
00:29:05.310 --> 00:29:07.260
Ry Jones: The paid subscriptions here.

206
00:29:09.630 --> 00:29:16.950
Ry Jones: The one that we pay the most for the ones that we pay the most for our artifacts Murray and circle ci those are the largest.

207
00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:20.850
Ry Jones: I guess, those are cat back strains.

208
00:29:21.900 --> 00:29:28.800
Ry Jones: mpm is very little money in docker hub is non zero money but artifact green circle ci are the two.

209
00:29:30.780 --> 00:29:32.520
Ry Jones: That we definitely gate.

210
00:29:34.020 --> 00:29:53.790
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): yeah no, I understand that i'm sorry I misspoke I really meant the other way around, is there anything an incubator project has that graduated product does, I would not expect that, so I you know it seems to me that would make it easier to digest this document, if it was built, as you know.

211
00:29:55.350 --> 00:30:07.200
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): Growing least with incubating and then graduating saying you have everything done competing projects have plus news fix So you can see exactly what the delta is.

212
00:30:07.890 --> 00:30:14.040
David Boswell: that's what I would want to make the project or I would want to make the documentation more digestible I guess my thought.

213
00:30:14.490 --> 00:30:23.700
David Boswell: Was that projects don't necessarily go through things literally like that, like you, don't necessarily become a lab first than an incubation project, so you know.

214
00:30:24.630 --> 00:30:31.230
David Boswell: That was my thought to kind of treat them like fully document each because you may come in at that given level, not the level before right.

215
00:30:34.230 --> 00:30:35.760
Tracy Kuhrt: yeah I think.

216
00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:43.290
Tracy Kuhrt: i'll let down on top, and then all I have a maybe maybe I have a comment on that as well, but Daniel i'll let you go first.

217
00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:52.800
Danno Ferrin: touch back to our nose point when the reasons that I asked for this for the staff to put this together, just to figure out what the graduation things are you know what.

218
00:30:53.250 --> 00:30:59.760
Danno Ferrin: Extra do you get at the next level, and I think starting out this way I mean you just go through think of what is it that they get it's not one was just a.

219
00:31:00.090 --> 00:31:03.720
Danno Ferrin: formatting issue to try and change how we present it, you know we could do the chart and everything.

220
00:31:04.350 --> 00:31:10.050
Danno Ferrin: But you know when I was looking through this and I was looking through what instead of does a project have to go to graduated.

221
00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:17.430
Danno Ferrin: It was there was no centralized place even look up this information be sure that this is what we get so I think that's a step towards that direction.

222
00:31:18.030 --> 00:31:25.230
Danno Ferrin: I don't think it'll take too much to reformat it in one of those good better best plans, like you, you might get from web hosting or something.

223
00:31:25.980 --> 00:31:34.170
Danno Ferrin: So I think we'll get there, but I think the big thing that just pointed out here is there's not a huge difference between an incubator and graduated project.

224
00:31:44.820 --> 00:31:49.050
David Boswell: Today that correct very suggesting there's there should be more of a difference.

225
00:31:50.550 --> 00:31:57.060
Danno Ferrin: I forgot yeah because I think there should be more of a carrots to go to graduated rather than staying and definitely an incubation.

226
00:31:57.390 --> 00:32:10.860
Danno Ferrin: Because the phrase incubation implies you're going to leave you're going to grow or you're not going to be viable anymore it, you know the naming Convention I like it, because it implies it's not a steady state it's you know it's a transitory state like inflation.

227
00:32:16.410 --> 00:32:17.370
Tracy Kuhrt: And I agree, I think.

228
00:32:18.030 --> 00:32:18.360
David Boswell: Sorry go.

229
00:32:18.660 --> 00:32:19.710
Tracy Kuhrt: Ahead no go ahead.

230
00:32:20.790 --> 00:32:27.570
David Boswell: I was gonna say I agree, and I do think there should be a you know, a substantial difference to offer that carrot and maybe some of those differences.

231
00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:40.920
David Boswell: Are subtle, but I think there definitely are things that would incentivize somebody to go through there like maybe the way that we phrased it doesn't like highlight what those differences are enough, but I feel like there are significant differences.

232
00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:43.080
David Boswell: But again, maybe subtle.

233
00:32:45.900 --> 00:32:52.890
Tracy Kuhrt: I think it's I think the document as it's written as I know, hasn't done it too is is difficult to see that right.

234
00:32:54.180 --> 00:32:56.400
Tracy Kuhrt: You know it, it could be.

235
00:32:57.510 --> 00:33:02.160
Tracy Kuhrt: The formatting that are now recommends, it could be, we put together some sort of.

236
00:33:03.930 --> 00:33:11.460
Tracy Kuhrt: A chart that is check check not checked right really shows you what the the true differences are.

237
00:33:12.750 --> 00:33:25.530
Tracy Kuhrt: If it's working though that is making them different than that's has to be somehow highlighted I think in in the way that this document is put together so that people can truly see.

238
00:33:26.070 --> 00:33:33.480
Tracy Kuhrt: This is the new stuff right or, this is what this level provide you that the other level doesn't right.

239
00:33:34.950 --> 00:33:52.770
Ry Jones: Sure, I agree completely and I this one of the historical context of this came from, there was a much larger difference and this exercise definitely showed me that there is not perhaps as much a difference as there should be so.

240
00:33:53.790 --> 00:33:55.500
Ry Jones: i'm interested in.

241
00:33:56.700 --> 00:34:08.130
Ry Jones: feedback on how how it is that we can What are those services, and how can we differentiate that so this, this was a good exercise for me, even if we don't end up.

242
00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:13.500
Ry Jones: Making huge changes because they're just the delta is not large.

243
00:34:17.070 --> 00:34:19.560
Tracy Kuhrt: yeah that's a good question to put to the tasc right.

244
00:34:20.490 --> 00:34:24.450
Tracy Kuhrt: What do we think a graduated project should get that makes it special.

245
00:34:25.980 --> 00:34:37.020
Tracy Kuhrt: What, in addition to to maybe the things that are being offered should we think outside the box and see about whether or not that could be something that we add to the.

246
00:34:38.250 --> 00:34:38.910
Tracy Kuhrt: To the list.

247
00:34:42.630 --> 00:34:48.120
Tracy Kuhrt: So I don't know if anybody has any suggestions or husband on other sorts of projects, whereby.

248
00:34:49.230 --> 00:35:12.090
Tracy Kuhrt: there's a true distinction level for graduated versus incubated versus labs or sandbox whenever they might call that project and that project, but you know, a sort of examples I think would be helpful to to provide I know I had provided one, I think, from the Academy software foundation.

249
00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:14.820
Tracy Kuhrt: So.

250
00:35:16.620 --> 00:35:19.830
Tracy Kuhrt: If there's other people who have been in projects or.

251
00:35:21.450 --> 00:35:25.800
Tracy Kuhrt: who have seen different ways of looking at this, I think that would be appreciate it.

252
00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:36.540
Peter Somogyvari: Maybe you could mention.

253
00:35:37.890 --> 00:35:41.970
Peter Somogyvari: The paid security audits that happened for projects.

254
00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:49.650
Ry Jones: That hasn't been as.

255
00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:54.120
Ry Jones: I mean that's not as distinct, as it has been.

256
00:35:57.450 --> 00:36:00.510
Ry Jones: we're doing an audit for ursa which is not graduated right.

257
00:36:01.290 --> 00:36:02.100
Peter Somogyvari: and practice.

258
00:36:02.310 --> 00:36:03.030
Ry Jones: and practice.

259
00:36:05.190 --> 00:36:14.160
Danno Ferrin: And even then you don't it's not like something continue to do every court only change significant things like basis pretty good pretty stable we haven't needed an audit but.

260
00:36:14.670 --> 00:36:20.910
Danno Ferrin: we're trying to get one lined up for when we finish our merge work so that we can get on it and make sure we didn't introduce any.

261
00:36:21.540 --> 00:36:33.930
Danno Ferrin: And we're doing some significant things as far as communication between two nodes and https so that's not obviously good security walk through there but also architectural but not every project change their architecture once a year, or once a quarter so.

262
00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:54.750
David Boswell: I can highlight a couple of things that are new and so maybe that's why it's not clear that there is a distinction here, but you know we are starting to do these project workshops, for example.

263
00:36:55.440 --> 00:37:05.400
David Boswell: People may have seen that we're doing one, starting with areas and indie I think that is something that should be graduated only you know those are going to be, you know significant.

264
00:37:05.910 --> 00:37:20.280
David Boswell: resources to help onboard new users of the project new contributors to the projects, I think that should be something that is perhaps limited and I, hopefully, that would be an incentive those seem to be doing really well the areas workshop, we are having to close it's filled up so quickly.

265
00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:32.400
David Boswell: I think another thing that could be worth doing, although it's not clear yet is maybe relook at the hyper ledger website and maybe give graduated projects much more prominent.

266
00:37:32.910 --> 00:37:43.800
David Boswell: Exposure there and that could be a difference as well, but again that's not in place now, so it might not seem obvious that that is something that might be a difference, but that could be part of the marketing.

267
00:37:44.820 --> 00:37:46.590
David Boswell: Differences between those levels as well.

268
00:37:48.630 --> 00:37:48.960
Tracy Kuhrt: part.

269
00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:56.100
Hart Montgomery: yeah, I just wanted to agree with David here that I think we should have a lead market graduated projects more.

270
00:37:56.970 --> 00:38:08.370
Hart Montgomery: This will substantially decrease, I think it will encourage projects to graduate and it might also substantially decrease confusion in the hyper ledger space.

271
00:38:08.820 --> 00:38:20.880
Hart Montgomery: When traditionally we've just put out in the greenhouse graphic all the projects, even those in incubation it's a lot more to process that and if we just have the handful of projects, you know, say that have graduated.

272
00:38:26.670 --> 00:38:28.500
Ry Jones: We have done a little bit of that.

273
00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:35.580
Ry Jones: If you go I guess i'm driving right now, so if you go to you know hyper ledger.org.

274
00:38:36.900 --> 00:38:40.800
Ry Jones: We are putting the graduated projects.

275
00:38:42.930 --> 00:38:46.350
Ry Jones: I thought we were putting the graduated projects above the oh OK.

276
00:38:47.550 --> 00:38:49.260
David Boswell: We did on the wiki main page.

277
00:38:49.830 --> 00:38:51.000
Ry Jones: Right, but this.

278
00:38:52.020 --> 00:38:54.870
Ry Jones: This should have the landscape embedded right here.

279
00:38:55.290 --> 00:38:56.220
Daniela Barbosa: The second spoken.

280
00:38:56.490 --> 00:38:56.970
So.

281
00:38:58.440 --> 00:39:01.500
Ry Jones: yeah but the graduated projects would be at the top.

282
00:39:02.730 --> 00:39:12.210
Ry Jones: There we go, so the graduate projects are the top incubated and then below that the dormant project, so we are working on a little bit, but point taken.

283
00:39:17.940 --> 00:39:19.920
Peter Somogyvari: deals will be something there.

284
00:39:21.150 --> 00:39:21.960
Peter Somogyvari: may be.

285
00:39:23.610 --> 00:39:34.110
Peter Somogyvari: congratulated projects get a bigger budget for mentorship so that there's more competitors coming in that way.

286
00:39:37.620 --> 00:39:47.070
Ry Jones: There could be I think over the last two mentorship cycles, I believe we accepted everyone that applied.

287
00:39:48.300 --> 00:39:52.230
Ry Jones: I believe that every project was funded because we we weren't limited.

288
00:39:54.210 --> 00:39:58.860
Ry Jones: There weren't enough applications to run a mentorship so we had money for everyone that applied.

289
00:39:59.550 --> 00:40:00.270
So.

290
00:40:01.590 --> 00:40:03.960
Peter Somogyvari: What that limits the option there then.

291
00:40:05.220 --> 00:40:15.330
Daniela Barbosa: Then, Peter I like that idea is the priority or the graduated projects if we do have to select from any, which hopefully will be the case.

292
00:40:23.700 --> 00:40:24.030
Tracy Kuhrt: A route.

293
00:40:26.910 --> 00:40:36.450
Aruna S M: So sorry I was thinking through the dog, but then I guess what I just said, it concerns me a little bit right now right so.

294
00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:45.510
Aruna S M: um I mean when I hear about hyper ledger and the kind of engagement, I I hear out there in the public Community there is.

295
00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:56.460
Aruna S M: interest among Community members to participate to 10 and participate, so they are looking for any kind of opportunity to get on board and in terms of contribution.

296
00:40:57.420 --> 00:41:07.680
Aruna S M: And I think the point that you just spoke about it concerns me a bit maybe i'll connect offline about it, I believe we should have at least received more applications.

297
00:41:08.790 --> 00:41:09.000
Right.

298
00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:16.440
Ry Jones: Right it wasn't that we were low on applications, it was we were low on programs for people to apply for.

299
00:41:18.750 --> 00:41:19.050
Aruna S M: hockey.

300
00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:21.360
Ry Jones: Okay, so so we got a budget for I don't know how many.

301
00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:23.100
Ry Jones: let's say 20 mentor ships.

302
00:41:23.250 --> 00:41:29.820
Ry Jones: And we only had 17 memberships that were proposed by the projects so that that was a limitation.

303
00:41:32.370 --> 00:41:34.620
Aruna S M: or I misinterpreted it sorry thanks.

304
00:41:38.340 --> 00:41:38.700
Tracy Kuhrt: Oh no.

305
00:41:39.870 --> 00:41:47.160
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): yeah I think yeah occurs to me that I think one of the challenges we have you know and and maybe this is why.

306
00:41:47.580 --> 00:42:05.010
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): You know and, by the way, I agree, this was very useful exercise to kind of try to you know I actually put on paper, so to speak, the differences which are not that large, as has been pointed out, and I think one of the reasons it maybe there isn't that much of a difference is because.

307
00:42:06.120 --> 00:42:20.760
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): I think there is a bit of a conflict in trying to help actually the the project that are typically in incubation, for instance, and and trying to put a carrot as Donald said.

308
00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:34.830
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): For the graduation, and you know project day and graduation what i'm trying to say is that you know, on the one it seems fair to say hey graduated project deserve more services on the other end the really days.

309
00:42:35.130 --> 00:42:45.900
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): Maybe it's the one that I incubation that needs the most help right and I don't really know how to deal with this kind of like tension, because you know.

310
00:42:47.970 --> 00:42:49.050
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): yeah I think.

311
00:42:50.340 --> 00:42:59.670
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): You know what stops most project from moving out of incubation, as we all know, is the lack of diversity and contribution and so.

312
00:43:00.510 --> 00:43:05.310
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): Saying well we're going to kind of push them down on the website and other areas.

313
00:43:05.640 --> 00:43:18.150
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): This kind of deserving you know it's it's counterproductive in trying to help them get to the you know broader community of contributors, so I don't know how to deal with that tension.

314
00:43:18.540 --> 00:43:26.760
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): That or how do we make it so that graduate projects have an advantage and how do we help still the incubation projects.

315
00:43:28.440 --> 00:43:38.370
Tracy Kuhrt: yeah i'm glad you said that, I know I because I was thinking something similar right my brain went well at what point do we start to discourage incubation right.

316
00:43:39.510 --> 00:43:45.450
Tracy Kuhrt: Because we were giving all of the the highlight to the graduate at projects right.

317
00:43:46.590 --> 00:44:00.120
Tracy Kuhrt: You know, because you could take that to an extreme and and really do a disservice to the the people who are trying to build the next new thing right, which is what you what you would expect to find in in labs or an incubation.

318
00:44:01.380 --> 00:44:10.230
Tracy Kuhrt: And, and the next new thing is, is, I think, just as important as the things that we want to be stable and graduate it so.

319
00:44:11.340 --> 00:44:18.960
Tracy Kuhrt: Have the same exact not as you, and so I think there is an interesting tension and interesting balance that we're going to have to bring to all of this.

320
00:44:28.290 --> 00:44:32.400
Tracy Kuhrt: All right, any other thoughts on this document before we move to the next topic.

321
00:44:37.290 --> 00:44:48.630
Peter Somogyvari: Someone mentioned the converting the document into your chart format and I want to pass on that idea what I envisioned was.

322
00:44:50.490 --> 00:44:57.780
Peter Somogyvari: Some product landing page where they have the free tier the protein the enterprise here, and then you have these.

323
00:44:58.920 --> 00:45:02.820
Peter Somogyvari: list of features that are included and there's always this.

324
00:45:03.900 --> 00:45:09.540
Peter Somogyvari: pattern of how the number of features are growing, so you want to be on the enterprise to which is so best.

325
00:45:11.460 --> 00:45:24.330
Peter Somogyvari: Talking that's that's something that a lot of people spend a lot of times and it's immediately clear that the the best to to talk to you is to carrot and you should get there.

326
00:45:27.990 --> 00:45:28.200
yeah.

327
00:45:29.790 --> 00:45:32.070
Tracy Kuhrt: thanks for that Peter so right.

328
00:45:32.190 --> 00:45:33.930
Tracy Kuhrt: David I hope that's.

329
00:45:34.620 --> 00:45:35.610
Tracy Kuhrt: been valuable.

330
00:45:35.970 --> 00:45:37.200
Tracy Kuhrt: As far as feedback.

331
00:45:39.630 --> 00:45:50.130
David Boswell: yeah absolutely especially making the more digestible will definitely play around with the format and then maybe when that's more clear, we can discuss do we have the balance right between how much easier has of each.

332
00:45:53.220 --> 00:45:53.730
Tracy Kuhrt: sounds good.

333
00:45:56.340 --> 00:45:58.950
Tracy Kuhrt: Alright, so if we look at the next topic.

334
00:46:00.030 --> 00:46:10.800
Tracy Kuhrt: This is a topic that I saw someone mentioned and throughout in last week's meeting, but I wanted to put it up for some sort of discussion to see in general, what people are thinking.

335
00:46:12.060 --> 00:46:24.750
Tracy Kuhrt: Specifically, because we do have a number of overdue project reports, I was thinking, what can we do about that right, I again maybe this is more stick than it is a carrot.

336
00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:34.710
Tracy Kuhrt: But should we be moving projects to a dormant state if we haven't heard from a particular project within a given amount of time.

337
00:46:35.520 --> 00:46:55.710
Tracy Kuhrt: With their project reports so want to open that up for discussion and see if anybody had thoughts on that if it sounded like a good idea, bad idea or had other sorts of thoughts on how we can encourage people to put together their project reports for the PSC right.

338
00:46:56.640 --> 00:47:04.530
Ry Jones: This one to give a little bit of an historical context here in that we did when composer transition.

339
00:47:05.700 --> 00:47:15.180
Ry Jones: It was, I think a year or so after they stopped filing updates before there was any official move to to transition, the project.

340
00:47:16.560 --> 00:47:22.380
Ry Jones: And it was, I think that was hard on everybody, and so I would I would encourage the members of the tasc to.

341
00:47:23.550 --> 00:47:27.120
Ry Jones: find a way to to enact this and you know.

342
00:47:28.260 --> 00:47:35.070
Ry Jones: Not not make it so punitive but acknowledge reality, so that people can understand the shape of the thing better.

343
00:47:36.690 --> 00:47:41.040
Tracy Kuhrt: yeah I mean right part of the reason that the project reports were put together.

344
00:47:41.730 --> 00:47:52.080
Tracy Kuhrt: was to ensure that the projects were in some sort of healthy state right, we were having a hard time as a TC trying to understand kind of a status of projects and what was happening.

345
00:47:52.500 --> 00:47:57.900
Tracy Kuhrt: With those projects and and really This is our This is our insight into each of the projects.

346
00:47:58.590 --> 00:48:07.200
Tracy Kuhrt: Hopefully we'll get a bit more insight, now that we are going to be attending meetings to see how things are actually running but definitely a piece.

347
00:48:07.860 --> 00:48:23.580
Tracy Kuhrt: The other piece that I would say is that, in looking at the domain state as we wrote it up, it was supposed to be, at the request of the projects, so this would be changing kind of the thinking around that as well you know.

348
00:48:25.410 --> 00:48:35.310
Danno Ferrin: So yeah I remember when we talked about the current state we discuss the possibility of involuntary dormancy but we never We said we cross that bridge when we get there, and I think we're quickly getting there.

349
00:48:36.060 --> 00:48:43.590
Danno Ferrin: With one of the projects on here that's now a month late, and I think a year between reports is too long ago the Germans, because another thing about dorfman's.

350
00:48:43.920 --> 00:48:50.760
Danno Ferrin: Is you can revive the project from dormancy it's not like dedicated to say we're done can't use the names to a fork in it, you know.

351
00:48:51.210 --> 00:49:01.530
Danno Ferrin: If a project has legitimate reason why they've been dormant you know, or maybe not so the reason, then they get their act together, they can say hey we're back we're going to do good you know move us back to incubation.

352
00:49:03.330 --> 00:49:13.140
Danno Ferrin: So I think you know, we should consider what thresholds on project reports is one of the triggers for involuntary and I think if you miss a full quarter, I think we should have a vote on it.

353
00:49:14.670 --> 00:49:22.560
Danno Ferrin: The question is, if they're consistently late, you know, maybe not, but I think that's you know, to put a red herring out there to start the discussion that I would suggest that.

354
00:49:22.980 --> 00:49:29.400
Danno Ferrin: A project, and this is a full quarter report, we should it's not forest, but we should have a vote in the discussion on involuntary norman's.

355
00:49:32.580 --> 00:49:33.690
Tracy Kuhrt: Okay, all right.

356
00:49:35.100 --> 00:49:37.920
Aruna S M: i'll couple of points first is related to.

357
00:49:39.180 --> 00:49:44.010
Aruna S M: Government state governments state, as you said, sounds like an informed decision by project.

358
00:49:45.060 --> 00:49:54.330
Aruna S M: TEAM members, they come together and then they say to tsa hey, this is the period that we're going let's say quiet for a period and and will probably come back.

359
00:49:56.040 --> 00:50:06.180
Aruna S M: Maybe we need revision on to that destination and what we are planning under dominant state right so just because a project is and adornment we cannot move it to.

360
00:50:10.590 --> 00:50:22.170
Aruna S M: Right, so I think my thought process was to introduce a new state, but if that something that we can edit under the Dom and state itself that's something we should look into the second point I wanted to bring out was.

361
00:50:22.980 --> 00:50:35.520
Aruna S M: Maybe a report says not submitting reports is not the only reason why we should consider this there could be other reasons that we should look into and I would request more additional time to think through that.

362
00:50:39.120 --> 00:50:42.930
Tracy Kuhrt: Okay yeah definitely I there could be other reasons that we might want to decide that.

363
00:50:44.010 --> 00:51:01.950
Tracy Kuhrt: project should head towards dormant state, so you know if there's things that people can think about this was just in my face as far as the overdue project report so that that seemed like an obvious sort of thing to to have a discussion around right.

364
00:51:03.570 --> 00:51:05.010
Ry Jones: sure there is.

365
00:51:06.090 --> 00:51:09.210
Ry Jones: One more thing there, which is.

366
00:51:11.070 --> 00:51:16.890
Ry Jones: You know, get up also you know lots of smart stuff is read only or whatever archived.

367
00:51:18.060 --> 00:51:26.820
Ry Jones: So there could be you know that's that would be really rude to come into a project and just archive all the repos i'm not saying we should do that, but that is.

368
00:51:27.240 --> 00:51:43.890
Ry Jones: If you're looking at a project and the repos are not active and not archived like if you've got 40 open bugs you know 100 and reviewed PRS that could also be the trigger and then Oh, I see what you sent me and I will post it in the chat.

369
00:51:47.670 --> 00:51:54.690
Danno Ferrin: That was to individualize supposed to all I posted that into the chat so one thing we should look at is the definition of dormant.

370
00:51:55.830 --> 00:52:02.910
Danno Ferrin: It does say there that the TC will make the decision is where the project is a dormant to or from Georgia state, upon request, and it doesn't see your question.

371
00:52:04.050 --> 00:52:06.330
Danno Ferrin: I mean, I guess what applications requesting the project.

372
00:52:06.900 --> 00:52:07.950
Danno Ferrin: But you know.

373
00:52:09.210 --> 00:52:20.820
Danno Ferrin: it's you know that the definition is projects and dormant or ones with normal functions are suspended or slow down for a period of time, and I think that the the CSC realizing that that's the current state of the project and current functioning.

374
00:52:22.500 --> 00:52:23.430
Danno Ferrin: You know, I think.

375
00:52:23.910 --> 00:52:27.840
Danno Ferrin: I think I think it's within bounds the definition, but i'm willing to be you know discussed on it.

376
00:52:30.780 --> 00:52:31.920
Tracy Kuhrt: Okay, Peter.

377
00:52:34.230 --> 00:52:56.190
Peter Somogyvari: I read that anytime that happens, we should vote on it, and we should have context and then, if they missed the report or two, and now we are considering it, then you should also reach out via the normal channels email and chat and just flat out ask them or you don't.

378
00:52:57.450 --> 00:53:11.310
Peter Somogyvari: And if no one is even there to respond and it would be much easier on my conscience, for example, to vote saying yes that's it on a project let's pull the plug but if they respond and say oh.

379
00:53:13.080 --> 00:53:25.200
Peter Somogyvari: The lead maintainer was an accident and then out of work for months, but now we're back, so please give us some more time than I would say in the vote, I would say.

380
00:53:25.710 --> 00:53:36.210
Peter Somogyvari: Well let's give them some more time, so I think they should make it part of the process to just get a little more context from the projects and then vote.

381
00:53:38.100 --> 00:53:42.240
Tracy Kuhrt: yeah definitely i'm Peter, and I know that.

382
00:53:43.410 --> 00:53:57.870
Tracy Kuhrt: When we started out this TC term Dino had volunteered to once a project went past it's due date for the project report reach out to that project to let them know that they had.

383
00:53:59.310 --> 00:54:04.890
Tracy Kuhrt: You know missed a reporting, if you will, and so I think you know.

384
00:54:05.760 --> 00:54:19.230
Tracy Kuhrt: We could make the assumption, and we can confirm with Daniel right that that is truly happening, and that he has reached out to these projects that are overdue and maybe hasn't returned or received a response back from them.

385
00:54:20.160 --> 00:54:24.750
Danno Ferrin: Yet for this week's but for bro they've done three beings to by email and one by chat group.

386
00:54:25.350 --> 00:54:25.560
yeah.

387
00:54:26.970 --> 00:54:27.330
Tracy Kuhrt: So.

388
00:54:29.220 --> 00:54:40.200
Nathan George: And I mean let's acknowledge the reality of this, we would reach out to them anyway, for this report, most of the steps we have to do to determine whether they're dormant or not, or the same steps we're doing just to try to hunt down the report.

389
00:54:40.530 --> 00:54:42.690
Nathan George: So it's not like it's a lot of additional work.

390
00:54:43.050 --> 00:54:51.270
Nathan George: And as a tlc we consider a project going into dormant a bit sad like it's not something we want to have happen and we would do it to someone else.

391
00:54:51.540 --> 00:54:59.250
Nathan George: You know, deliberately against their will, or in any way maliciously what we do want to acknowledge reality, because we realized that being an active project, it takes work.

392
00:55:00.150 --> 00:55:05.370
Nathan George: and hopefully moving a project that's struggling to even submit a report is a relief.

393
00:55:06.060 --> 00:55:18.150
Nathan George: We want to relieve that burden and get let them focus on the things that will help their project become active as opposed to being you know, in the middle of trying to you know figure out incubation requirements or you know.

394
00:55:19.380 --> 00:55:23.910
Nathan George: cater to the requests of the tasc about status when there's really not much going on, so.

395
00:55:27.150 --> 00:55:33.300
Nathan George: I think that this seems really reasonable that if you miss a whole quarter report, and no one can get Ahold of you.

396
00:55:33.630 --> 00:55:43.140
Nathan George: That the tsp would ask hey are you guys dharma it's not an answer that has a predetermined conclusion and we're not going to try to move a project to dormant that doesn't want to go to dormant.

397
00:55:43.620 --> 00:55:55.770
Nathan George: we're going to ask them, so what are you doing to be active and I don't think it's anything more than just trying to acknowledge the reality to reduce the amount of burden on everyone that's that's trying to do a good job with their project.

398
00:55:58.230 --> 00:55:58.530
Tracy Kuhrt: alright.

399
00:55:58.620 --> 00:55:59.910
Tracy Kuhrt: Thanks Nathan heart.

400
00:56:01.140 --> 00:56:09.900
Hart Montgomery: um yeah and I guess, I know that that sort of borough is on everybody's mind, I guess, so I assume.

401
00:56:10.050 --> 00:56:14.220
Hart Montgomery: danna has reached out to silas on this.

402
00:56:15.840 --> 00:56:17.460
Hart Montgomery: i'd be curious to hear what.

403
00:56:18.930 --> 00:56:21.390
Hart Montgomery: silas had to say about this.

404
00:56:22.170 --> 00:56:25.050
Danno Ferrin: And also, aside from silence that's the problem.

405
00:56:25.140 --> 00:56:31.860
Hart Montgomery: Okay yeah and i'll say sorry about my quarterly report, this was quite the week to to miss the email on it.

406
00:56:33.720 --> 00:56:39.450
Danno Ferrin: I think one or two weeks is in a crisis, I think three months is really the threshold.

407
00:56:42.180 --> 00:56:55.470
Tracy Kuhrt: yeah yeah I heard this definitely wasn't wasn't trying to call you out a way, shape or form for missing this week, we think that we seem to have had some this one's quite quite a bit here it's just a.

408
00:56:56.310 --> 00:56:57.450
Tracy Kuhrt: more a question of.

409
00:56:57.810 --> 00:57:01.740
Tracy Kuhrt: You know these long term ones that are on my mind so.

410
00:57:06.630 --> 00:57:13.920
Tracy Kuhrt: I don't know if your hand is still up or if you wanted it okay great i'm Nathan.

411
00:57:15.090 --> 00:57:20.460
Nathan George: I would even say we don't mind a little bit of quarterly report rebellion as long as they're here and actively rebelling.

412
00:57:21.690 --> 00:57:31.980
Nathan George: it's just we want to acknowledge the reality of if the products truly dominant don't get Ahold of someone that's a really bad contributor experience if someone's trying to use the project for someone's trying to fix something.

413
00:57:33.840 --> 00:57:35.250
Tracy Kuhrt: For sure no.

414
00:57:35.460 --> 00:57:38.490
Danno Ferrin: rebellion is an indicator of life and that's really what we're looking for.

415
00:57:43.140 --> 00:57:46.260
Grace Hartley: Is that mean I get to skip the basic quarterly report next week.

416
00:57:52.020 --> 00:57:54.000
Hart Montgomery: grace grace is the same thing.

417
00:57:55.230 --> 00:58:03.690
Tracy Kuhrt: You know we're not having a meeting next week guys, but at the same time, definitely have it done for the first week of January, so I don't have to call you out.

418
00:58:08.280 --> 00:58:11.220
Tracy Kuhrt: All right, any other comments on this particular topic.

419
00:58:16.530 --> 00:58:21.720
Tracy Kuhrt: It sounds like we're all fairly much in agreement would it be worthwhile for me to you.

420
00:58:22.140 --> 00:58:28.320
Tracy Kuhrt: I go ahead and write up some sort of decision log entry for us to take a look at when we come back in here.

421
00:58:35.010 --> 00:58:36.180
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): sounds good to me.

422
00:58:37.020 --> 00:58:38.880
Tracy Kuhrt: Okay, I will work on that, then.

423
00:58:41.190 --> 00:58:41.910
Tracy Kuhrt: Alright, so.

424
00:58:42.090 --> 00:58:44.730
Tracy Kuhrt: We do still have about six minutes left.

425
00:58:46.290 --> 00:59:01.380
Tracy Kuhrt: Would anybody from the task force, we have to task force out there, I think grace and a room, would you like to provide an update on kind of where you're at if there's anything that stands out to you that might be useful for the rest of the gst to know about.

426
00:59:03.900 --> 00:59:13.140
Aruna S M: Or, I can go first and probably make it short, so we had our first congregation our first meeting early this week and.

427
00:59:14.190 --> 00:59:21.180
Aruna S M: There was enough interest that I received through email but However, I could not see that getting translated onto our attendance on that call.

428
00:59:21.720 --> 00:59:31.020
Aruna S M: However, i'm pushing hard to get more participation from all the projects as much as possible to the task force now, apart from the participation, there were really.

429
00:59:31.650 --> 00:59:40.590
Aruna S M: Good points made out and during the call and thanks to all of you who contributed to those thoughts and there have been couple of action items noted down.

430
00:59:41.700 --> 00:59:45.990
Aruna S M: The main action items are going to be around, how do we measure.

431
00:59:47.520 --> 00:59:56.520
Aruna S M: criticality of particular vulnerability that gets reported right, how do we even measure that if it is a generic bug versus something that needs attention.

432
00:59:57.180 --> 01:00:07.470
Aruna S M: And what's the score on which we should decide on, I mean decide the criticality plus there was an action item on on coming up with a.

433
01:00:09.690 --> 01:00:14.790
Aruna S M: questionnaire for deciding for a particular maintain or how to report.

434
01:00:15.960 --> 01:00:16.920
Aruna S M: It let me open up.

435
01:00:19.050 --> 01:00:30.630
Aruna S M: These Task Force agenda item but at a high level meeting minutes has been posted on the task force wiki page So if you have any comments on those open.

436
01:00:31.380 --> 01:00:42.840
Aruna S M: Items or maybe any of the notes items on that page please feel free to comment, and please do join our next call that would be three weeks from now, mostly in first week of Chan.

437
01:00:46.530 --> 01:01:04.590
Tracy Kuhrt: Alright, thanks I did just put a link out to the wider Security Task Force on the TC chat so definitely have a look and let her know if you're interested or can provide some insight into what your different projects are doing related to security.

438
01:01:06.300 --> 01:01:08.010
Tracy Kuhrt: Great any update for us.

439
01:01:09.510 --> 01:01:14.310
Grace Hartley: yeah I think most of the group is update but um we're currently interesting.

440
01:01:15.390 --> 01:01:20.370
Grace Hartley: data gathering mode for the chat Task Force and understanding how.

441
01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:25.920
Grace Hartley: The different communities within communities across hyper ledger use different channels.

442
01:01:27.180 --> 01:01:29.730
Grace Hartley: Our next meeting will be the first week of January.

443
01:01:30.870 --> 01:01:35.010
Grace Hartley: The ideas to share their the kind of final.

444
01:01:36.120 --> 01:01:43.710
Grace Hartley: inputs and then maybe start to put together a proposal kind of here, maybe the you know, two or three kind of options that we have.

445
01:01:44.550 --> 01:01:57.780
Grace Hartley: The what we're hoping is, by the end of January to have kind of a recommendation and be able to implement, because obviously you know aligning on the chat channel strategy is important for facilitating our Community, we don't want to draw it out, you will.

446
01:02:02.640 --> 01:02:08.430
Tracy Kuhrt: also put a link to the Community chat Task Force out there as well.

447
01:02:09.840 --> 01:02:13.830
Tracy Kuhrt: So I think there's been lots of good discussions in that particular task force so far.

448
01:02:14.910 --> 01:02:20.700
Tracy Kuhrt: um yeah with that I think that's our agenda, unless there's anything that anybody else would like to add.

449
01:02:26.340 --> 01:02:27.930
Ry Jones: Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.
