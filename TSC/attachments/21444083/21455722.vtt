Tracy Kuhrt: Welcome everyone to the march 3 PFC meeting I you are all aware that on this call before, but I must say.

3
00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:35.280
Tracy Kuhrt: I must abide by the antitrust policy notice, which is currently displayed on the screen, as well as our code of conduct, which is linked in the agenda.

4
00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:42.930
Tracy Kuhrt: So with that we have two announcements, the first announcement will actually both of these announcements you've seen before.

5
00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:58.080
Tracy Kuhrt: The first one is the Dev weekly developer newsletter goes out each Friday, if you have something you want included, please leave a comment on the wiki page that is linked in the agenda, and the second one is around the mentorship program the.

6
00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:16.530
Tracy Kuhrt: date is march night so we're six days away from that date for you to submit your project proposal so less than a week we haven't done it already Please submit your project proposal, the link here that's provided again, there are some.

7
00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:21.960
Tracy Kuhrt: Guidelines, as well as a timeline that's also linked in the agenda.

8
00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.520
Tracy Kuhrt: Are there any other announcements that anybody would like to make.

9
00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:31.200
Tracy Kuhrt: Yes.

10
00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:39.210
Aruna S M: Thanks Tracy so some topic related to hyper ledger mentorship Program.

11
00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:49.560
Aruna S M: So, as most of you are aware, it's hyper ledger challenge hide deadline for submission it's a Community event really tight deadline for submissions this month march 1.

12
00:04:50.190 --> 00:05:03.690
Aruna S M: However, we have extended it to march 15 now we had I guess Nancy had a call earlier with Karen where it is possible for some of those submissions also be considered into mentorship Program.

13
00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:19.620
Aruna S M: If they find mentors for their submissions right, so we are trying our best to analyze which of those submissions are looking for mentors and then I encourage them to also submit to the mentorship program, but if you have.

14
00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:31.020
Aruna S M: Any if you know any of those submissions it's all available already on the wiki page if you can also go through them and suggest or be mentors for some of them.

15
00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:41.490
Aruna S M: please feel free to let us know, and we can connect you with the participants That way we can have more mentorship submissions if you feel some of those projects are valued.

16
00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:44.370
Aruna S M: Thank you.

17
00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:52.710
Tracy Kuhrt: Any other announcements that anybody would like to make.

18
00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:01.260
Tracy Kuhrt: Okay, so.

19
00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:07.770
Tracy Kuhrt: With no other announcements The next thing that we have our agenda or the quarterly reports.

20
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:31.440
Tracy Kuhrt: So it's just looking at them, it looks like the majority of them only have about four or five sorts of reviews done so, please take the time to review that I did see that we have some questions out to the cello maintain errs on the cello report.

21
00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:37.980
Tracy Kuhrt: The trends report doesn't currently have any questions.

22
00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:49.050
Tracy Kuhrt: The grid report we report it specifically the the maintainer is reported that their documentation is hard to find all the hyper ledger site.

23
00:06:50.070 --> 00:07:05.280
Tracy Kuhrt: So Benjamin I see you're on the call that has been tagged as something that you should be aware of, as you are working on making some updates to the site to make that an easier thing for us to accomplish.

24
00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:06.630
Benjamin Thomas: Great thanks.

25
00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:10.560
Tracy Kuhrt: yeah and then the last thing that we have.

26
00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:17.760
Tracy Kuhrt: If I look at the bevel one it looks like no I your question was responded to and the.

27
00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:27.840
Tracy Kuhrt: The project report updated so, are there any questions or anything else that we should make sure we're reaching out to the.

28
00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:31.740
Tracy Kuhrt: To the maintainer and something's different reports about.

29
00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:53.340
Nathan George: One question I often have especially associated so these projects that are very closely associated with fabric is are they keeping up with core fabric, I know that we had some trouble with that, when we have.

30
00:07:56.190 --> 00:08:01.080
Nathan George: When some projects in the past and I don't know that we have a really good way of.

31
00:08:01.530 --> 00:08:12.660
Nathan George: thc as the whole keep track of that so now, all I can really do is trust that the fabric maintainer is on the technical steering committee or are willing to put in their two cents when when something like that becomes an issue.

32
00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:19.650
Tracy Kuhrt: yeah definitely listen I am.

33
00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:32.250
Tracy Kuhrt: I think you know, unless we go out and take a look at where the code is and see kind of release notes and things like that it is definitely hard for us as TC numbers to see like what the.

34
00:08:33.390 --> 00:08:36.480
Tracy Kuhrt: The compatibility matrix it is, if you will.

35
00:08:37.830 --> 00:08:44.580
Tracy Kuhrt: You know I know some of the some of the documentation like I know for sure battle has a.

36
00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:56.040
Tracy Kuhrt: Compatibility matrix specifically within their documentation that says, which of the different versions of each of the different platforms that they support is.

37
00:08:57.150 --> 00:09:07.500
Tracy Kuhrt: I think it would be a good thing if we did similar sorts of things for these independent projects, if you will, where these projects that work with other projects, however, you want to say that.

38
00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:20.010
Tracy Kuhrt: Maybe it's a maybe Nathan it's worth adding just a comment to the cello project report to that effect.

39
00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:27.630
Nathan George: On i'm also also hasn't because I don't know I don't know what we want to create an issue that isn't an issue.

40
00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:35.160
Nathan George: As just a kind of a sensor in the maintainer is that we have enough help that we're keeping up.

41
00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:39.930
Tracy Kuhrt: yeah.

42
00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:57.840
Tracy Kuhrt: Anybody from who supports fabric of the maintainer or who has some knowledge there I know about cello and whether or not it is up to up to speed with like, at least the latest long term support.

43
00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:07.260
Kamlesh Nagware: So.

44
00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:16.260
Kamlesh Nagware: Moving slow for quite long time even last I think two to four year, but it still is still is not in condition to.

45
00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:32.190
Kamlesh Nagware: Not in the maturity level someone can use in production grade implementation given when is hardly to even I think there are two two to three mentors only and someone from IBM and other form some kind of mentee for the project.

46
00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:41.850
Kamlesh Nagware: I think I think he is not in a good state to us in some kind of production level implementation.

47
00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:46.020
Kamlesh Nagware: And is only supported fabric as a mom.

48
00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:51.120
Tracy Kuhrt: And you know what version of fabric.

49
00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:54.150
Kamlesh Nagware: So.

50
00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:57.810
Tracy Kuhrt: Do you know which version of fabric, it supports at this point.

51
00:10:58.530 --> 00:11:04.590
Kamlesh Nagware: Thank you last time I tried it was 1.4 and even that is very hard to even run.

52
00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:06.630
Tracy Kuhrt: Okay.

53
00:11:15.210 --> 00:11:20.430
Tracy Kuhrt: So Nathan mindy sounds like there, there is a need to ask the question anyway.

54
00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:25.500
Tracy Kuhrt: You know, maybe it's a.

55
00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:32.850
Tracy Kuhrt: particular case where you know they could add a mentorship project proposal.

56
00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:36.600
Tracy Kuhrt: To add support for the latest version or.

57
00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:42.960
Tracy Kuhrt: You know, David boswell I don't know if there's something that we need to do as far as.

58
00:11:44.850 --> 00:11:46.800
Tracy Kuhrt: Contribution campaign for cello.

59
00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:59.490
Tracy Kuhrt: To see if there's other people who would like to get involved with cello I do know that there's interesting whether or not cello supports other platforms, besides fabric as well.

60
00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:16.920
Tracy Kuhrt: Specifically, I think, Daniel asked a question and I know I saw a question asked within the discord channel and what versions, or what platforms it support so maybe that's something that we would want to reach out to them and go ahead did.

61
00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:27.090
David Boswell: I did, I was actually at a project called there recently and talk to them about that I, and I posted to the list it's certainly something we can do if there's interest on their end.

62
00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:30.240
Tracy Kuhrt: Okay.

63
00:12:33.690 --> 00:12:34.290
Tracy Kuhrt: Any other.

64
00:12:34.650 --> 00:12:37.710
Tracy Kuhrt: comments or questions on the quarterly reports.

65
00:12:42.810 --> 00:12:51.570
Aruna S M: I don't exactly know if cielo has already planned for supporting new version of fabric release, but I keep a check on new PR that are raised across or.

66
00:12:52.380 --> 00:13:08.130
Aruna S M: looks like cielo has some PR that are related to life cycle chain code which are part of the like to to release the lts version release so they might have started work on that just wanted to comment or not.

67
00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.440
Tracy Kuhrt: Okay well that's good good.

68
00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:11.790
Tracy Kuhrt: Good integration.

69
00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:20.130
Tracy Kuhrt: Any other comments this one on the project report.

70
00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:33.930
Tracy Kuhrt: Right like I said it's important for us to to be reviewing these let the projects know that we are interested in what they're doing.

71
00:13:35.130 --> 00:13:44.880
Tracy Kuhrt: You know, we plan, these reports are important, so if we're not reviewing them as the tsp then we're sending the wrong message, so I wrote.

72
00:13:45.930 --> 00:13:48.150
Aruna S M: Sorry, beginning I guess I.

73
00:13:49.230 --> 00:13:58.260
Aruna S M: wanted to paste a message on tlc channel then realize that previous question was not answered, so this is regarding a comment that I added in the transact report.

74
00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:02.190
Aruna S M: So I guess the statement.

75
00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:09.210
Aruna S M: We I need some more clarification on the statement, maybe fritters come home for Greece can have.

76
00:14:11.970 --> 00:14:16.410
Tracy Kuhrt: Yes, I think I think the question around that you had was around.

77
00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:23.190
Tracy Kuhrt: Whether or not we're asking the right question here when it comes to the inclusive language statement.

78
00:14:24.270 --> 00:14:25.770
Tracy Kuhrt: we're currently asking.

79
00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:35.340
Tracy Kuhrt: For you're asking, but does your I think it does your documentation include and inclusive language statement.

80
00:14:37.950 --> 00:14:40.110
Tracy Kuhrt: And the.

81
00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:58.290
Tracy Kuhrt: The way in which Andrea answered it is the way in which I think it was intended, which is that there's not really anything in their documentation to reflect the sort of this is what we should be doing as far as inclusive language.

82
00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:08.400
Tracy Kuhrt: And I think it really had the question of is that the question that we want to ask so Peter grace from our.

83
00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:13.050
Tracy Kuhrt: Vote have we asked for specifically.

84
00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:25.920
Tracy Kuhrt: We did approve the statement as it exists in the current project template project report template is is the idea behind this question.

85
00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:37.860
Tracy Kuhrt: Have you added something to your documentation, or is it more are you following the inclusive language statement in your documentation.

86
00:15:44.850 --> 00:15:49.770
Grace Hartley: i'm pulling up the link right now and just refresh myself if i'm being honest.

87
00:15:57.120 --> 00:16:00.960
Grace Hartley: One SEC Peter I don't know if you have thoughts before well I pulled up.

88
00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:04.440
Aruna S M: So I guess the question is.

89
00:16:04.470 --> 00:16:19.680
Tracy Kuhrt: What we what we add it specifically was have you added an inclusive language team into your projects documentation and or wiki pages and I linked to an example inclusive language statement which is basically this text that's below here.

90
00:16:21.390 --> 00:16:37.740
Tracy Kuhrt: As a yes, no question within the project template and I think everyone's asking if that's the question that we really desired or whether we desired to ask whether our documentation follows the inclusive language David.

91
00:16:47.250 --> 00:16:53.820
Grace Hartley: I think the sentiment was following inclusive language like up above, we have kind of.

92
00:16:55.710 --> 00:16:59.430
Grace Hartley: Like I think under recommendation it's like here's an example or here's what you can use.

93
00:17:00.660 --> 00:17:02.790
Grace Hartley: If you don't already have it, I think the.

94
00:17:03.930 --> 00:17:06.240
Grace Hartley: If the projects have.

95
00:17:07.290 --> 00:17:17.400
Grace Hartley: An inclusive language saving their own and they I i'm not opposed to them using what they already have, or you know, following those guidelines and just linking out to that, but but opened other's thoughts.

96
00:17:18.090 --> 00:17:20.190
Tracy Kuhrt: yeah so so, then you were more.

97
00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:35.070
Tracy Kuhrt: Just make sure that the documentation the wiki has this statement and inclusive language statement, maybe this one or their own within their documentation not are you following inclusive language within your documentation.

98
00:17:35.730 --> 00:17:38.310
Grace Hartley: yeah exactly yeah that's that was fine.

99
00:17:40.410 --> 00:17:41.040
Grace Hartley: that's what I.

100
00:17:42.090 --> 00:17:42.750
Grace Hartley: expected.

101
00:17:43.290 --> 00:17:44.280
Tracy Kuhrt: Okay, so.

102
00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:52.530
Tracy Kuhrt: Okay, thanks, Peter I ruin, I think that, then the question that is included in the template is as expected.

103
00:17:54.960 --> 00:18:03.690
Aruna S M: So the thing that made me what is that I saw an answer as know so I was like okay now probably this statement needs correction.

104
00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:15.390
Tracy Kuhrt: yeah, so I think they haven't yet included any sort of inclusive language statement in their documentation or wiki pages and since this was the first report, since this was passed I.

105
00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:25.140
Tracy Kuhrt: I would assume that most of our projects are probably in the same boat, where they don't have inclusive language damon unless they've specifically thought about that.

106
00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:37.140
Tracy Kuhrt: In the past, so my expectation is it's probably going to be no for quite a few of them until the point at which you know another quarter show goes by, and we start to see them get say yes.

107
00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:40.470
Aruna S M: Thanks.

108
00:18:41.070 --> 00:18:57.360
Peter Somogyvari: And just astounding example or I think the attention with the example was the help those, like myself, or a little more lazy, for example, my plan for practice is just a couple places example and.

109
00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:06.990
Peter Somogyvari: it's quick and easy so that the proposal does not just give you recommendations, but it also helps he didn't.

110
00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:14.730
Peter Somogyvari: So that was meant as a helpful a guardrail not something struck the prescribed.

111
00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:26.490
Tracy Kuhrt: Any other questions and on the project reports.

112
00:19:32.610 --> 00:19:36.270
Benjamin Thomas: addresses yes sorry just a backup on the hyper ledger websites.

113
00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:37.110
motioned.

114
00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:39.570
Benjamin Thomas: What does that involve exactly.

115
00:19:42.630 --> 00:19:44.400
Tracy Kuhrt: yeah so in in the grid.

116
00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:58.470
Tracy Kuhrt: Project report they imaging that their documentation which I think is what is a grid that hyper ledger.org slash docs if i'm not mistaken, is hard to.

117
00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:01.440
Tracy Kuhrt: hard to look at.

118
00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:04.380
Tracy Kuhrt: This is a great one.

119
00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:06.360
Tracy Kuhrt: This is correct.

120
00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:12.960
Benjamin Thomas: Oh yes, I know I know which task it's related to now got it.

121
00:20:13.770 --> 00:20:25.500
Tracy Kuhrt: yeah, so I think I think really it's, how do we this question, right here for documentation website is difficult to find starting from hyper ledger.org.

122
00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:40.050
Tracy Kuhrt: So I think it's really just a matter of on the grid page linking to this particular page I know we have a bunch of other links out there, like linking to the source code and things like that, but I think what they're asking for is for this to be.

123
00:20:41.070 --> 00:20:41.940
Tracy Kuhrt: A link as well.

124
00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:45.240
Benjamin Thomas: Okay okay right.

125
00:20:45.810 --> 00:20:46.050
Benjamin Thomas: yeah.

126
00:20:46.170 --> 00:20:46.620
No problem.

127
00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:51.960
Tracy Kuhrt: All right, any other questions on the project.

128
00:20:57.270 --> 00:21:13.440
Tracy Kuhrt: Okay, so if there's no other questions there, we do have a couple of topics that i've added for discussion purposes to this week's TC call the first one is this hyper ledger project families document that.

129
00:21:14.670 --> 00:21:28.470
Tracy Kuhrt: heart have put together probably a while ago and I updated it this week to talk about kind of what this is and to give some examples of maybe project families at the end.

130
00:21:29.610 --> 00:21:43.740
Tracy Kuhrt: But really you know we've talked about this in the past in the tlc calls around, how do we make it easier for people who are brand new to hyper ledger to navigate hyper ledger and the different projects that exist within them.

131
00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:55.050
Tracy Kuhrt: And so you know what was it three four months ago we we went through a process, a task force process where we updated the landscape.

132
00:21:55.620 --> 00:22:09.990
Tracy Kuhrt: And we basically have separated the projects into active and so I graduated projects and incubated projects and then we've also got them split into like distributed letters and tools and.

133
00:22:12.780 --> 00:22:14.220
Tracy Kuhrt: Libraries and.

134
00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:32.880
Tracy Kuhrt: Industry specific I think are the categories that we have, so the idea here is to talk about project families so we've got basically a main sort of project, if you will, and then a set of other projects that.

135
00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:46.110
Tracy Kuhrt: That support them and the, the idea is you know, can we instead of presenting you know 18 different projects widgets point we had 18.

136
00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:56.190
Tracy Kuhrt: You know, is there an easier way for us to to narrow that down for people coming in, say, you know what I i've heard about fabric, I want to use fabric.

137
00:22:56.610 --> 00:23:04.740
Tracy Kuhrt: Of what are all of the things that are related to fabric that might help me in my my journey of using fabric in deploying fabric and.

138
00:23:05.490 --> 00:23:14.940
Tracy Kuhrt: Monitoring fabric and that sort of thing right or i'm interested in, basically, I know i'm interested in kind of the theory of space, you know what are the tools and.

139
00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:28.350
Tracy Kuhrt: Other projects that will help me in in using a Su and and so on and so forth, so you know, I think that the question here is to the TC like do we like this idea.

140
00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:36.690
Tracy Kuhrt: Or, this is just a project families that exist in this document, something that makes sense is there.

141
00:23:37.860 --> 00:23:47.340
Tracy Kuhrt: other sorts of concerns that we want to bring up and think through as we, as we look at this particular proposal.

142
00:23:50.190 --> 00:23:57.600
Tracy Kuhrt: So i'm gonna stop talking and see if anybody has any initial comments on the the proposal itself.

143
00:24:01.650 --> 00:24:02.070
Tracy Kuhrt: Unless you much.

144
00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:07.020
Kamlesh Nagware: Is it, so I do.

145
00:24:08.250 --> 00:24:12.300
Kamlesh Nagware: I think, who is this political a similar thought I had in mind, because.

146
00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:19.110
Kamlesh Nagware: When lots of people interact with me also personally to is a Community Member.

147
00:24:19.620 --> 00:24:34.740
Kamlesh Nagware: They are not lots of confusion about the hyper ledger projects will have like supposed to be top or the ethereum to the valley theorem and maybe our involvement, but in hyper ledger is many things for every you know a little bit so in the end and lots of libraries.

148
00:24:36.060 --> 00:24:47.790
Kamlesh Nagware: So it still is very confusing people like it did talk about the hyper ledger so most people interpreted the fabric and they don't know about the other other projects.

149
00:24:48.810 --> 00:24:55.680
Kamlesh Nagware: So I didn't decide dividing in this, you know project families, I think, would be a good idea.

150
00:24:57.270 --> 00:25:08.310
Kamlesh Nagware: And, but for better marketing and PR marketing is needed to because there are lots of likes was Article this article that there is nothing more than that, but in hyper ledger is lots of things.

151
00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:21.450
Kamlesh Nagware: So, how we can make it as a beta kind of understanding for the Community, people who are using the projects and there are better understanding about what is hyper ledger fabric and other kind of projects.

152
00:25:24.990 --> 00:25:35.220
Tracy Kuhrt: yeah I agree, I think that's the intent of this particular proposal is to see what we can do to make it easier for people coming in the gym.

153
00:25:36.870 --> 00:25:46.350
Jim Zhang: Thanks Tracy I haven't read the document, so I can only base my comments on on what was shown earlier with the four different categories.

154
00:25:47.490 --> 00:25:52.590
Jim Zhang: The lts and tools and libraries and and forgot what the last one was.

155
00:25:55.410 --> 00:26:00.690
Jim Zhang: domain specific I think it's one it's good way, but as one way.

156
00:26:02.190 --> 00:26:05.070
Jim Zhang: We need to think about other dimensions, for example.

157
00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:17.130
Jim Zhang: india's very well known in self sovereign identity, but people may not necessarily know areas is also indispensable alright, if you want to do.

158
00:26:19.140 --> 00:26:20.640
Jim Zhang: You know interaction based.

159
00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:23.790
Jim Zhang: Proof of certificates.

160
00:26:25.290 --> 00:26:40.410
Jim Zhang: And, and if you want to do zero knowledge as part of that you are Sir how, how do we tell them these three are very useful if you're doing self sovereign identities or or decentralized identities.

161
00:26:42.060 --> 00:26:52.530
Jim Zhang: Another example is firefly belongs to tools that's fine, but then it's very different from everything else in tools in that it's actually part of a programming model.

162
00:26:52.800 --> 00:27:01.980
Jim Zhang: Whereas, everything else is more infrastructure, so I just feel like there, there are there are other dimensions that we should think about beyond these.

163
00:27:03.390 --> 00:27:05.940
Jim Zhang: This current way of of kept rising them.

164
00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:08.610
Tracy Kuhrt: yeah i'm.

165
00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:12.630
Tracy Kuhrt: right if you wouldn't mind this ruling to the end of this document, I did.

166
00:27:13.170 --> 00:27:20.610
Tracy Kuhrt: Throughout some suggested project families again it's it's a suggestion i'm not necessarily.

167
00:27:21.810 --> 00:27:30.090
Tracy Kuhrt: What we have to do, but trying to think about what are these these it's pretty much all the way to the bottom right so.

168
00:27:32.670 --> 00:27:44.910
Tracy Kuhrt: There you go right there so yeah some initial set of suggested project families, you can see here right the the hyper ledger in the product family would consistent in the areas bevel an ursa.

169
00:27:46.350 --> 00:27:54.600
Tracy Kuhrt: In a bevel because bevel can deploy in the networks if you're interested, but obviously in the areas are so so.

170
00:27:55.560 --> 00:28:11.490
Tracy Kuhrt: yeah I agree right it's, what are the right dimensions, I think, is is the question of how do we get people to take a look at you know where they start in and how they proceed through through the journey.

171
00:28:14.790 --> 00:28:15.450
Tracy Kuhrt: All right, Bobby.

172
00:28:16.830 --> 00:28:24.390
Bobbi Muscara: Well, I have to thank you for this, because this it from an educational perspective is more in line with how learners process information.

173
00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:29.700
Bobbi Muscara: So, again i've always taught the identity solution.

174
00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:38.730
Bobbi Muscara: Together, and it just makes sense, how it flows, so this document is invaluable for the education in the learning materials group.

175
00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:55.440
Hart Montgomery: hey so thanks everybody, first I want to emphasize that this is sort of a very rough proposal so feel free to like you know change it, or you know.

176
00:28:56.160 --> 00:29:08.460
Hart Montgomery: Propose suggestions, the overall goal, though, is that you know when when people visit the webpage when they think about hyper ledger we're sort of overloading them with with too much stuff and we need to find a way to reduce that.

177
00:29:09.060 --> 00:29:13.740
Hart Montgomery: And this seems like it might be a good way and we can sort of.

178
00:29:15.030 --> 00:29:28.410
Hart Montgomery: You know, we can tie some other things in there, like you know Community engagement and other stuff so that we incentivize these these families to you know have strong communities.

179
00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:37.050
Hart Montgomery: And Jim I don't think you know you brought up the the categories, and this is sort of orthogonal to the categories.

180
00:29:38.220 --> 00:29:46.080
Hart Montgomery: This this is going to be something very different from the old diagrams that we're not going to categorize things necessarily by.

181
00:29:47.370 --> 00:29:51.690
Hart Montgomery: By what they do, but what are their relationships with other projects.

182
00:29:54.450 --> 00:29:55.980
Tracy Kuhrt: yeah thanks um.

183
00:29:56.280 --> 00:30:00.420
Tracy Kuhrt: I think that's kind of important looking at you know kind of this listing if you will.

184
00:30:01.590 --> 00:30:08.880
Tracy Kuhrt: You know, maybe you might not think kat this caliber fire firefly when you think they see right, but these are tools that.

185
00:30:09.420 --> 00:30:15.810
Tracy Kuhrt: will work, specifically with a Su so if you're interested in the interoperability with banks you cactuses your.

186
00:30:16.740 --> 00:30:24.300
Tracy Kuhrt: You know project that you would look at caliper for performance and then firefly for other sorts of interoperability, if you will, so.

187
00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:31.560
Tracy Kuhrt: When I put this together, I started kind of with the the elt projects and that's kind of why you see it, the way it is.

188
00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:49.020
Tracy Kuhrt: And then the other piece that I looked at this at the bottom is there's also these other projects that we have that actually work with projects that are both in hyper ledger and projects that are outside of hyper ledger and maybe they deserve that kind of their own.

189
00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:53.460
Tracy Kuhrt: Billing, if you will, when it comes to marketing so.

190
00:30:54.600 --> 00:31:06.630
Tracy Kuhrt: You know i'd like heart said, I think this is a, this is a suggestion this isn't meant to be like Yes, this is final, and this is how we're going to do it this isn't meant to start the discussion around.

191
00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:08.790
Aruna S M: Thanks Tracy.

192
00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:16.020
Aruna S M: My opinion on on this is probably we should still keep the categorization that we have currently.

193
00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:28.410
Aruna S M: However, I like this idea right so from this idea I see some of these projects are listed only on fabric, for instance level could actually fall into base so as well, I know.

194
00:31:28.980 --> 00:31:40.800
Aruna S M: It could potentially I know it's listed under too often So are we are probably suggesting here is the compatibility across these different projects that are within hyper ledger.

195
00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:50.460
Aruna S M: And these are possibly the tool site or list of frameworks that you will use together to build your tech stack for solving.

196
00:31:51.450 --> 00:32:06.570
Aruna S M: Certain problem statements, so I like the idea, and I would suggest i'm, in my opinion, again, we should complement this alongside what we already have than replacing what we have, through the.

197
00:32:09.150 --> 00:32:14.190
Aruna S M: The categorization that we already have done so over here my.

198
00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:28.920
Aruna S M: Priorities would be to group to group them together and probably say if your problem statement is self sovereign identity here are the projects that you can generally use together and here is how they all fit in in the tech stack.

199
00:32:29.940 --> 00:32:46.170
Aruna S M: and start using it, if you are looking into solving generic database or problem statements, then here are the projects that you can potentially use and here is the compatibility of different projects availability within within the school.

200
00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:48.000
Aruna S M: Thanks.

201
00:32:48.810 --> 00:32:49.680
Tracy Kuhrt: yeah Thank you.

202
00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:52.320
Tracy Kuhrt: I mean, this is not intended to be static.

203
00:32:52.620 --> 00:32:55.680
Tracy Kuhrt: cello decide at some point in the future they're going to support.

204
00:32:56.850 --> 00:33:05.850
Tracy Kuhrt: You know, as you are, or even in the right South youth right like there's nothing that says we can't add them to that list so.

205
00:33:07.230 --> 00:33:08.400
Tracy Kuhrt: intended to be.

206
00:33:11.010 --> 00:33:14.310
Tracy Kuhrt: Changing as the project strange Peter.

207
00:33:16.860 --> 00:33:25.920
Peter Somogyvari: I just wanted to push on this idea of it's great because it will save me from having to do some explaining with the current.

208
00:33:26.790 --> 00:33:40.590
Peter Somogyvari: Greenhouse picture I always have to go sort of say that taxes anything to Calgary will also be in our category you're not sure which is instead I can just say.

209
00:33:41.370 --> 00:33:51.720
Peter Somogyvari: that's a tool that's adjacent to these letters right now and then people can sort of draw conclusions from there, and on the website, I think it helps because.

210
00:33:52.680 --> 00:34:03.990
Peter Somogyvari: Most people I mentioned come in saying to themselves, so I need a ledger and I heard of hyper ledger so on I will go and see what that is about.

211
00:34:05.580 --> 00:34:21.720
Peter Somogyvari: And then, based on that they will start with the D O T cells will be probably our first direction coin, and then the stadium down, then they will discover these other projects such as the one that i'm making off, so I think it's great.

212
00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:28.920
To see like.

213
00:34:30.540 --> 00:34:32.550
Kamlesh Nagware: today's good, but I think this will also.

214
00:34:34.050 --> 00:34:42.750
Kamlesh Nagware: Take feedback from the Community, not just the teeth to decide whether this is a writing like suppose, for example, with the hyper laser beam went to the Foundation.

215
00:34:43.230 --> 00:34:51.150
Kamlesh Nagware: Nothing for the was how Community want to see the the projects will be listed in their awareness, maybe.

216
00:34:51.930 --> 00:35:05.910
Kamlesh Nagware: There could be some survey feedback created in we do the auto understanding about the project and then maybe some kind of what kind of project families to be their community will decide whether this is right or.

217
00:35:07.260 --> 00:35:08.400
Kamlesh Nagware: Not just the view seemingly.

218
00:35:11.940 --> 00:35:20.730
Tracy Kuhrt: Complex role, obviously, the Community is welcome to join these calls and provide their inputs, you know I i'm not sure.

219
00:35:21.330 --> 00:35:28.950
Tracy Kuhrt: Obviously, how we get Community joining this call, because I think, important for them to join and have this discussion with this, I agree.

220
00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:45.900
Tracy Kuhrt: This should be like hey we're the TC and we're just gonna lay down the law, I want other people to be involved in these discussions so anything that you do to point other folks in the Community to this document to add their thoughts I think is gonna make this a better thing right.

221
00:35:46.860 --> 00:36:05.040
Kamlesh Nagware: yeah I mean like suppose getting on some kind of survey survey form and we post on the social media and they fit within the Community from a few weeks, and then the civil decide what the majority of things about dividing the position of families.

222
00:36:06.210 --> 00:36:10.740
Tracy Kuhrt: Now, Sir surveys are hard because we don't tend to get the response that we want.

223
00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:12.330
Kamlesh Nagware: But.

224
00:36:12.420 --> 00:36:18.930
Tracy Kuhrt: yeah I, I agree that we need to get you know more eyes on this and more thoughts on this Angela.

225
00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:28.350
Angelo De Caro: yeah I would say that's beautiful I like a lot, I like a lot of that we can we can also print I was just playing a little bit you can print this.

226
00:36:28.860 --> 00:36:34.260
Angelo De Caro: poster I will bring some aware of some of them, putting IBM very nice I said I.

227
00:36:35.160 --> 00:36:50.550
Angelo De Caro: see if I can suggest I would because tougher it looks like a good place for visibility as well, and I would give a chance, also to to hyper ledger labs project to appear there, for instance, there is, there are a few gems in the hyper ledger knobs that don't receive enough.

228
00:36:51.600 --> 00:37:04.350
Angelo De Caro: Publicity like this stage Sean this blockchain agnostic state channel project p2p room I don't know what's the right pronunciation it's just such a great project, but unfortunately it's not receiving enough publicity.

229
00:37:05.460 --> 00:37:06.540
Angelo De Caro: But great I like it all.

230
00:37:08.340 --> 00:37:09.270
Tracy Kuhrt: Right thanks Angela.

231
00:37:09.810 --> 00:37:10.470
i'm.

232
00:37:12.120 --> 00:37:12.540
Tracy Kuhrt: David.

233
00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:21.360
David Boswell: yeah just a plus one, a couple of things have been said, I absolutely agree about what was just said about the labs I think this could be a really nice way to associate.

234
00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:27.480
David Boswell: labs with the different project families when they do apply so yeah absolutely to that and also to what a rune said.

235
00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:39.180
David Boswell: I do see this as a compliment to the landscape and not a replacement for it just to share I went to most of those greenhouse tasks where it's called so just to share my memory of those and if other people around those tasks for his calls, you can.

236
00:37:39.750 --> 00:37:51.480
David Boswell: remind me, but the landscape was explicitly not intended to be an onboarding tool, I remember that discussion came up a number of times you know I think the goal of the landscape was somewhat different from what we're talking about now and.

237
00:37:52.470 --> 00:37:56.730
David Boswell: I believe that one of the recommendations from the greenhouse task force when they.

238
00:37:57.150 --> 00:38:07.440
David Boswell: close down was that we should focus some time and effort on onboarding materials, which I think this is exactly it right, so I think this is great, and this is complimentary the landscape has a role.

239
00:38:07.860 --> 00:38:21.210
David Boswell: But it's not for onboarding new people I think something like this that provides information in a more digestible way is that, and so I do see these as complimentary and I think this is a task that the greenhouse Task Force encouraged us to take on so it's great to see us doing it.

240
00:38:25.020 --> 00:38:28.440
Tracy Kuhrt: i'm so i'll just add some.

241
00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:33.540
Tracy Kuhrt: I don't know i'll be the devil's advocate, if you will see that the labs thing.

242
00:38:34.920 --> 00:38:40.890
Tracy Kuhrt: So when we initially proposed labs as a place where the Community could come together and.

243
00:38:41.580 --> 00:38:54.840
Tracy Kuhrt: You know, do some experimentation and and we bring their thoughts about what they might do to improve the different hyper ledger projects, it was intended to be low cost low cost for.

244
00:38:55.830 --> 00:39:09.240
Tracy Kuhrt: The people who wanted to bring their labs and start contributing and collaborating in an environment that was under hyper ledger low cost for the staff as far as marketing and.

245
00:39:10.980 --> 00:39:27.930
Tracy Kuhrt: those sorts of things so and then the other piece of this obviously is the more data we throw at people, the harder it's going to be for them to figure things out so so playing devil's advocate when it comes to labs I agree there's great stuff out there.

246
00:39:29.010 --> 00:39:29.640
Tracy Kuhrt: and

247
00:39:30.780 --> 00:39:33.540
Tracy Kuhrt: But also, do we want to.

248
00:39:35.100 --> 00:39:37.740
Tracy Kuhrt: To do that is a question that you know.

249
00:39:38.970 --> 00:39:53.580
Tracy Kuhrt: We should think about and think through how that impacts, the discover ability of things when you start having to explain more right like this is a lab and it's not a project, and this is how lab stiffer than projects.

250
00:39:54.660 --> 00:40:02.370
Tracy Kuhrt: It will potentially custom additional sorts of stream when you're when you're brand new coming in, so.

251
00:40:03.750 --> 00:40:09.720
Tracy Kuhrt: i'm I just want to make sure that we think through that before we throw labs into this mix as well.

252
00:40:11.580 --> 00:40:20.850
Hart Montgomery: So yeah a couple of things, I think one of the main points of this is we want sort of like three to five sort of main things that we can put.

253
00:40:22.470 --> 00:40:28.080
Hart Montgomery: You know, we can put on we can highlight on a web page just for for the lack of information overload.

254
00:40:29.790 --> 00:40:39.570
Hart Montgomery: And if you know if one of the labs is one of the three to five most exciting things that we have going on in hyper ledger we probably aren't doing something right.

255
00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:57.930
Hart Montgomery: That being said, Angelo i'm very excited by by person and some of the other labs as well, and I have a halfway written up email to you about in particular person and other stuff, so I will mail you to follow up on that.

256
00:41:03.180 --> 00:41:12.420
Tracy Kuhrt: Alright, thanks hurt um Okay, so I think I think from here one of the things that i'd like to have the TC do is to.

257
00:41:13.260 --> 00:41:26.850
Tracy Kuhrt: Open the document provide your thoughts and your feedback and let's continue this conversation kind of an offline asynchronous mode, but before we get there right i'm not going to cut you off cut your hand up and down so.

258
00:41:28.170 --> 00:41:28.380
Tracy Kuhrt: What.

259
00:41:29.550 --> 00:41:32.520
Ry Jones: I was trying to do the thumbs up emotion I clicked.

260
00:41:34.440 --> 00:41:36.540
Ry Jones: So yeah it's cool sorry.

261
00:41:37.140 --> 00:41:37.320
Tracy Kuhrt: No.

262
00:41:37.410 --> 00:41:47.460
Tracy Kuhrt: No worries um yeah so this link is obviously an agenda, please take the time to add your thoughts and you know make this better.

263
00:41:50.160 --> 00:42:00.840
Tracy Kuhrt: Alright, we have one other item on the agenda, and that is the project health collection issue Jim I did notice that you put kind of a.

264
00:42:02.340 --> 00:42:05.610
Tracy Kuhrt: An update in here about the sorts of things that you think are.

265
00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:16.710
Tracy Kuhrt: That you've discovered so far in the issue right if you wouldn't mind truly done a bit just to the like up the list three three beta that here.

266
00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:35.250
Tracy Kuhrt: So yeah Jim you put this together as kind of an offline mode, I think that the next question is, you know what's next do we create a task force, where do we go from here so Jim if you wouldn't mind just walking us through kind of where things are at what the next step should be.

267
00:42:36.090 --> 00:42:56.280
Jim Zhang: yeah absolutely thanks Tracy so thanks to everyone who has contributed your thoughts in the last couple weeks on this topic, I think this is very important topic as we're struggling earlier to understand, for example, some of the projects status, I think, defining a standard.

268
00:42:57.360 --> 00:43:05.970
Jim Zhang: list of dimensions that would we all agree on that would define a objectively the health of a project.

269
00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:10.530
Jim Zhang: Is is very important, I think, is pretty odd.

270
00:43:12.180 --> 00:43:26.160
Jim Zhang: And we need to do the grunt work of identifying those and I see those being done in two steps, one is, we need a agree on the High Level bullet list of what are the things we care about.

271
00:43:27.990 --> 00:43:35.640
Jim Zhang: And that's that's in the first So you can see, this list as three levels, the first two levels captures sort of the conceptual.

272
00:43:36.540 --> 00:43:44.670
Jim Zhang: dimensions, we care about, and then the last level are types of data that can be used to support.

273
00:43:45.390 --> 00:43:55.290
Jim Zhang: That particular attribute or dimension, so what we've got so far is at the high level, we have two categories one is the Community.

274
00:43:56.100 --> 00:44:18.120
Jim Zhang: How how well is the Community coming together behind the project how live, is it, and what are the chances that this community will continue to grow and survive and the other high level category is code is this Community producing useful code that are being adopted in real world projects.

275
00:44:20.370 --> 00:44:27.150
Jim Zhang: And then under Community I think this is mainly summarizing the things that's already been.

276
00:44:28.230 --> 00:44:32.670
Jim Zhang: discussed and talked about by Tracy.

277
00:44:33.900 --> 00:44:39.870
Jim Zhang: David Hart and others and that's the these five various.

278
00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:49.800
Jim Zhang: Growth diversity retention of contributors maturity and responsiveness.

279
00:44:51.390 --> 00:44:59.070
Jim Zhang: And then, if you look at the sample it's under each of those are the types of data that can should be collected to support them.

280
00:45:00.570 --> 00:45:16.020
Jim Zhang: And then under code so far we've tied to one is usefulness, another is production readiness, so this is still pretty pretty dynamic and still ongoing.

281
00:45:17.250 --> 00:45:28.110
Jim Zhang: i'd like to propose that we continue doing this for at least another week or two depending on how much more content and progress we can make.

282
00:45:29.370 --> 00:45:41.640
Jim Zhang: asynchronously before we organize a task force so so if we can get to agree on a list of high level conceptual dimensions.

283
00:45:43.710 --> 00:46:05.100
Jim Zhang: First, then we can organize a task force behind how to how to get ideas, so we can collect the right data to to objectively reflect on those dimensions so that's the that's the current status of where this is.

284
00:46:07.020 --> 00:46:08.220
Jim Zhang: would love to hear.

285
00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:12.840
Jim Zhang: thoughts and suggestions from anybody.

286
00:46:15.240 --> 00:46:17.370
Jim Zhang: Tracy did you have anything else to add.

287
00:46:19.320 --> 00:46:26.400
Tracy Kuhrt: So, Jim I think this is, I think this is making some good progress, I think there's definitely.

288
00:46:27.810 --> 00:46:32.370
Tracy Kuhrt: Some specific things so far that we can look at the.

289
00:46:33.600 --> 00:46:40.800
Tracy Kuhrt: One thing that I think we should consider as we take this to kind of task force or implementation, however, you.

290
00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:41.850
Tracy Kuhrt: want to look at it is.

291
00:46:42.150 --> 00:46:45.330
Tracy Kuhrt: How do we get the fx.

292
00:46:45.450 --> 00:46:57.750
Tracy Kuhrt: insights team involved in this, so that this isn't just a thing that you use for us, but for others as well, and so that we're not recreating what's already out there right.

293
00:46:58.710 --> 00:47:06.450
Tracy Kuhrt: I think that's that's where where my head's at right now I also just because it was there and.

294
00:47:07.050 --> 00:47:18.360
Tracy Kuhrt: right with scrolling through it, there are some things, specifically in the metrics that might be hard to to come to I specifically I saw one that was around the.

295
00:47:18.900 --> 00:47:31.470
Tracy Kuhrt: Involvement in design discussion from from discord I think it would be hard to separate out what design discussion versus what a question from.

296
00:47:32.550 --> 00:47:42.270
Tracy Kuhrt: You know just from the perspective of you do we have to run some sort of language analytics is to figure out is this a design discussion for this, or is this.

297
00:47:43.440 --> 00:47:50.520
Tracy Kuhrt: Is this something that somebody came into say that contributors channel and asked a question and it wasn't really related to any sort of design.

298
00:47:51.750 --> 00:47:53.310
Tracy Kuhrt: sort of question right so.

299
00:47:54.360 --> 00:47:56.880
Tracy Kuhrt: right if you come off mute I don't know if you have a comment there.

300
00:47:57.330 --> 00:47:59.220
Ry Jones: yeah I did actually want to talk this time.

301
00:48:00.330 --> 00:48:23.430
Ry Jones: I would absolutely like you know, plus one that I, my preferred end of this project would be to get the lf X team to build this dashboard because I don't think this is useful, you know for hyper ledger I think this is useful for all of the Linux foundation projects.

302
00:48:24.480 --> 00:48:42.660
Ry Jones: And I know that some of this existing all effects is really hard to find so if we can feed these in to fx and get this built for us, or a system of building that and say this is, this is what we need, you know that would be where I would prefer that we.

303
00:48:44.460 --> 00:48:46.350
Ry Jones: Were we hyper ledger go.

304
00:48:49.320 --> 00:48:50.160
Tracy Kuhrt: completely agree.

305
00:48:51.900 --> 00:49:09.600
Tracy Kuhrt: You know if we do when we do create this task force, I would look to heart right yourself to bring in whoever the right people are from El effects they have these discussions directly with us to say yes, this is possible, or no this isn't possible.

306
00:49:10.830 --> 00:49:12.900
Tracy Kuhrt: You know and help us through that process.

307
00:49:15.210 --> 00:49:17.130
Ry Jones: I will gladly harangue them.

308
00:49:19.890 --> 00:49:20.310
Tracy Kuhrt: And so.

309
00:49:21.390 --> 00:49:35.700
Angelo De Caro: You just have to curiosity, maybe this is being done already, by other foundations, I didn't know the Apache foundation is much older than hyper ledger do you know any any or any of you know if this has been already done if they have already predictors.

310
00:49:36.840 --> 00:49:46.740
Angelo De Caro: I found interesting is they do predictors of the success of our projects, I doubt they exist, but it would be interesting to see if it's possible to derive such predictors.

311
00:49:49.980 --> 00:49:52.110
Hart Montgomery: So Angela, to my knowledge, this has not.

312
00:49:52.140 --> 00:49:54.300
Hart Montgomery: been done before them.

313
00:49:55.410 --> 00:50:01.950
Hart Montgomery: Maybe you know somebody can correct me on this because it's entirely possible, it has been done and I just don't know about it.

314
00:50:03.270 --> 00:50:13.920
Hart Montgomery: But to my knowledge, the most like, no one has applied, you know modern machine learning to this or anything like that, to my knowledge sort of the most.

315
00:50:15.420 --> 00:50:29.040
Hart Montgomery: I guess advanced tooling around this has historically been done by the cnc F and fx is trying to pull a lot of that stuff in, and that has sort of become some of the fx tools.

316
00:50:30.330 --> 00:50:37.350
Hart Montgomery: But you know, we should probably interact more closely with fx.

317
00:50:38.370 --> 00:50:39.690
Hart Montgomery: And, and maybe.

318
00:50:41.070 --> 00:50:55.890
Hart Montgomery: You know I know Ryan, has a lot more experience with talking to these folks than I do, but maybe we should set up some kind of fx hyper ledger meeting, where we let you know maintain errs and tasc members and everybody.

319
00:50:56.910 --> 00:50:57.690
Hart Montgomery: discuss.

320
00:50:59.250 --> 00:51:02.520
Hart Montgomery: Right, do you think that would be something that lf X would agree to.

321
00:51:03.990 --> 00:51:09.330
Ry Jones: I can ask, I know that we've had them on the tlc call before for that and.

322
00:51:10.890 --> 00:51:13.350
Ry Jones: I can ask and let's see if we can make it happen.

323
00:51:14.940 --> 00:51:23.760
Tracy Kuhrt: yeah I think the key is we don't want a presentation, we want a discussion, I wanted to discuss with the art of the possible.

324
00:51:25.260 --> 00:51:28.410
Tracy Kuhrt: To get to the place where we understand.

325
00:51:29.700 --> 00:51:31.170
Tracy Kuhrt: You know helpful projects and.

326
00:51:32.370 --> 00:51:36.180
Tracy Kuhrt: predictors, if you will, as Angela called him Jim.

327
00:51:37.710 --> 00:51:48.930
Jim Zhang: yeah to further answer angels question to what heart said Angela you might be astonished that I actually seek out to read some papers on this subject.

328
00:51:50.400 --> 00:52:00.510
Jim Zhang: The chat is disabled, but I would send the link to the group there was this the latest published paper on this subject was.

329
00:52:01.470 --> 00:52:19.740
Jim Zhang: sometime in 2021 and the conclusion was so so the author of the paper looked at 56 other published papers on the topic that conclusion there's there's not a good methodology behind this very important topic and and some of this this high level.

330
00:52:20.850 --> 00:52:37.440
Jim Zhang: dimensions were taken from from the content of that paper so so yeah like hearts at it there's not a good solution to this, especially considering the tools available with machine learning and natural language processing all that.

331
00:52:38.970 --> 00:52:43.500
Jim Zhang: we're we're sort of blazing some new trails here.

332
00:52:48.480 --> 00:52:50.220
Tracy Kuhrt: yeah if we post, the link.

333
00:52:50.490 --> 00:52:52.260
Tracy Kuhrt: for everyone to take a look and read.

334
00:52:53.400 --> 00:52:57.780
Tracy Kuhrt: In the thc channel, and we can all come up to speed with where you're at.

335
00:53:00.300 --> 00:53:04.590
Tracy Kuhrt: All right, any other comments or questions on this at this point.

336
00:53:14.070 --> 00:53:24.000
Tracy Kuhrt: Alright, I highly encourage For those of you who haven't been participating in this issue, to have a look taken and read and add your thoughts to this.

337
00:53:24.660 --> 00:53:33.450
Tracy Kuhrt: One yeah well only get the right thing if everybody has a chance to contribute their thoughts and make this a better a better thing for all of us.

338
00:53:35.640 --> 00:53:42.660
Tracy Kuhrt: Alright, so with that there's nothing else on the agenda is there any other things that anybody would like to bring up before we close me.

339
00:53:50.700 --> 00:53:57.900
Tracy Kuhrt: All right, i'll take that as a no, I see no hands, I see nobody coming off mute so thank you all for joining and participating in the discussion.

340
00:53:58.650 --> 00:54:07.080
Tracy Kuhrt: looks like we have a few offline discussion items for us to take go and and provide our thoughts and feedback on so.

341
00:54:07.770 --> 00:54:22.710
Tracy Kuhrt: Please do that as well as if you haven't had a chance to take a look at the project report yet, please take the time here that you have the short amount of time to at least get through one of them, and with that we will talk to you again next week.
