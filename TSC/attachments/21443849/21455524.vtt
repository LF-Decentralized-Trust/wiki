1
00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:34.350
Tracy Kuhrt: Alright, welcome everybody to the February 3 hyper ledger tlc call and, as you are probably all aware, there are two things that you must abide by on this call.

2
00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:45.900
Tracy Kuhrt: The first one is the antitrust policy notice, which is currently displayed on the screen and the second one is our code of conduct, which is linked in the agenda.

3
00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:49.200
Tracy Kuhrt: Just don't be a jerk.

4
00:00:50.250 --> 00:01:03.000
Tracy Kuhrt: And everybody is welcome here and able to participate so welcome to our guests that she on the call who are not tasc numbers, you are also welcome to participate and provide your thoughts and feedback as well.

5
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.500
Tracy Kuhrt: So we have two announcements or two official announcements, maybe some other announcements will come out of this but.

6
00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:18.330
Tracy Kuhrt: The first one is one that we see every week, the Dev weekly developer newsletter goes out each Friday, if you have anything.

7
00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:27.210
Tracy Kuhrt: Related to your project you're saying you're working group anything that's going on in the Community, that you think would be of interest to our hyper ledger developers.

8
00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:42.210
Tracy Kuhrt: Please consider clicking on that link there and adding a comment on the wiki page to be included in that newsletter the second one last week men talked about the 2020 few mentorship Program.

9
00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:55.650
Tracy Kuhrt: The call for mentors and projects has been initiated as of February 1 I think it was so if you have a project proposal that you would like to consider having.

10
00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:11.430
Tracy Kuhrt: brought to the tasc for consideration Please submit a project proposal there is a timeline information that's available for you to take a look at, as well as different guidelines for you, for submitting the proposal.

11
00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:29.820
Tracy Kuhrt: really great program obviously been very successful in the past year, so please consider doing that I have seen a few chats going on in our chats with different projects, considering already what sort of projects they'd like to bring forth so that's really good news.

12
00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:39.600
Tracy Kuhrt: So those are the official announcements i'd like to see if there's anybody on the call, who has an announcement that they would like to make to the TC.

13
00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:57.120
Tracy Kuhrt: Alright, see no hands see nobody coming off mute I will take that as a no, we do have quarterly reports that have been submitted.

14
00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:05.190
Tracy Kuhrt: The explorer report has been submitted from last year Q4 so please have a look at that I.

15
00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:12.690
Tracy Kuhrt: saw this morning, I think there were only five people who have had a chance to look at that, so far, so please go ahead and take a look at that.

16
00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:26.430
Tracy Kuhrt: The sawtooth report came in last week, but it came in, I think, on Wednesday, so I left it on the the list for this week in case any sort of questions came up and, but I just have.

17
00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:31.770
Tracy Kuhrt: to know whether or not anybody has any questions about explorer or sawtooth.

18
00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.600
Tracy Kuhrt: any sort of discussion, we would like to have related to those reports.

19
00:03:46.620 --> 00:04:06.810
Tracy Kuhrt: right again see no hands see nobody come off mute i'm going to take it as no I will note for those of you who have not looked at the explorer report, yet they did mention that they are struggling with project help and are looking for more people to come in and contribute to that project.

20
00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:09.390
Tracy Kuhrt: and

21
00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.880
Tracy Kuhrt: I saw David, I think you had commented about ways that they might.

22
00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:21.690
Tracy Kuhrt: work with you to to get more contributors involved so much appreciated there for that call out.

23
00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:26.190
Tracy Kuhrt: yeah then yeah.

24
00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:42.570
Daniela Barbosa: hey just wanted to let everyone know, yes, this is a project, we have reached out to the original contributing company, who had said that they would like to assist as well, so we'll be putting a plan together to bring that back to the explore project.

25
00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.920
Tracy Kuhrt: Okay, good.

26
00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:46.080
Daniela Barbosa: Thank.

27
00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:46.590
You.

28
00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:49.470
Tracy Kuhrt: All right.

29
00:04:51.480 --> 00:05:09.240
Tracy Kuhrt: So yeah other than that we have areas in indy that we're looking to get project reports from we're also looking next week for the roja report to come in, I get include borough on the list, even though it's darn it, I think you know some of our discussion here today.

30
00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:14.730
Tracy Kuhrt: around what we will do with donut projects is it may be.

31
00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:25.980
Tracy Kuhrt: Interesting conversation and, but I do think it's worthwhile to for us to remember that these projects still are on the.

32
00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:30.810
Tracy Kuhrt: calendar for providing PSC project updates.

33
00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:43.320
Tracy Kuhrt: Alright, so let's get into the meat of the meeting and let's talk about first the project lifecycle discussion there's two items here that I want to talk about.

34
00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:56.550
Tracy Kuhrt: That, I think right you brought up to us, which I think are good discussions have as tasc so let's start with the deprecate it versus end of life for avalon.

35
00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:05.310
Tracy Kuhrt: I think if you look at our project life cycle, you will see that deprecate it projects are projects that.

36
00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:08.790
Tracy Kuhrt: Are.

37
00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:19.470
Tracy Kuhrt: expecting to have people maintaining that for at least another six months and, as we all know, avalon has.

38
00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:39.690
Tracy Kuhrt: stopped supporting that I think, maybe, almost a year ago, so I think that the question here is, should we have sent everyone directly to end of life, instead of putting it through the deprecate it stage first and then waiting, six months before we end the.

39
00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:41.370
Tracy Kuhrt: DEMO.

40
00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:54.510
Danno Ferrin: So one of my questions is where to get it was stuck working on over a year ago, because the q2 and q1 hyper ledger have lunch reports, the first words on project health Babylon is healthy.

41
00:06:54.990 --> 00:07:08.670
Danno Ferrin: I mean, why should we not believe meditators and they submit a report like that and q2 submitted in June, so the earliest that things could have not been functional, I would say is June, because they may have claimed it was healthy.

42
00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:18.570
Danno Ferrin: So you know to operate as if they've been non functional since March, you know we don't have eyes in there to say otherwise it's based off of.

43
00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:26.610
Danno Ferrin: intel's pulling out that the other non Intel contributors are saying we're gonna make a go for it, and then they decided in the end, not to go to conference computing sorry uh but.

44
00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:31.260
Tracy Kuhrt: yeah it's a.

45
00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:32.550
Tracy Kuhrt: it's a good.

46
00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:40.110
Tracy Kuhrt: question about the help I guess one right.

47
00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:55.170
Tracy Kuhrt: If we look at kind of the statistics, I guess they've had three contributors in the past year when active contributor, in the last month as of February 1.

48
00:07:55.830 --> 00:08:05.580
Tracy Kuhrt: i'm sorry the last six months, so refers, so I think that's maybe where the the year is coming from it's just a small number of commits that have been happening.

49
00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:11.550
Tracy Kuhrt: But yes you're exactly right if the project is telling us they're all good.

50
00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:15.270
Tracy Kuhrt: We cannot do anything to help them or to.

51
00:08:16.590 --> 00:08:23.400
Tracy Kuhrt: expect that those are different, and I think that's maybe part of our second discussion means to to really talk about how do we get.

52
00:08:24.990 --> 00:08:30.540
Tracy Kuhrt: analytics information that will help us understand the state of projects, other than the project reports.

53
00:08:34.830 --> 00:08:35.340
Ry Jones: When I.

54
00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:42.180
Ry Jones: said this earlier, I will admit that I was looking primarily at.

55
00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:50.430
Ry Jones: commit history and PR comments stuff like that activity in github.

56
00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:59.520
Ry Jones: I did not look at the quarterly reports, so my assertion around the end of activity could very well be.

57
00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:01.050
Ry Jones: wrong.

58
00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:04.020
Ry Jones: Perhaps they were active in some other forum.

59
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:24.480
Tracy Kuhrt: Other thoughts on this particular topic we okay with having a project that's in deprecating State that is not getting any support whatsoever.

60
00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:36.660
Tracy Kuhrt: part.

61
00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:44.430
Hart Montgomery: I mean Tracy I totally agree with you that by the definition avalanche be end of life and not deprecate it.

62
00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:55.200
Tracy Kuhrt: yeah I mean I think that's the key here right is just looking at what we've written in the past for a project lifecycle.

63
00:09:58.110 --> 00:10:08.580
Tracy Kuhrt: And I think the other piece of this is that, according to the the graph at the top, we can go directly from incubation to end of life.

64
00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:17.220
Tracy Kuhrt: there's there's nothing that says, we have to go through a duplicated phase first.

65
00:10:23.370 --> 00:10:25.170
Tracy Kuhrt: Any other thoughts on this.

66
00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:30.330
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): So.

67
00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:31.260
Anybody.

68
00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:34.770
Tracy Kuhrt: who's against moving is the end of life.

69
00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:37.620
Tracy Kuhrt: Oh no I saw you came up.

70
00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:41.250
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): yeah so i'm not against it, I just you know.

71
00:10:43.650 --> 00:10:51.330
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): In some ways, I feel like you're in it there's not much harm in keeping it where it is now for a bit longer but.

72
00:10:51.930 --> 00:11:07.170
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): You know, if anything, it, you know it provides an opportunity for anybody else to come back and say Oh, I want to resurrect it, but I think the likelihood in practice is very low, so i'm fine either.

73
00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:10.830
Tracy Kuhrt: anything.

74
00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:21.480
Nathan George: I would just point out that this is a case where it's more important to be patient, that is to be correct i'm just like arno said there's no harm in it being where it is now.

75
00:11:22.650 --> 00:11:25.830
Nathan George: If we feel like we need to move it I don't think there's any harm in that either.

76
00:11:27.630 --> 00:11:32.160
Nathan George: I, but I also don't think we have to be in a hurry to do it necessarily as long as we don't forget to do it.

77
00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:36.090
Nathan George: yeah definitely.

78
00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:39.210
Tracy Kuhrt: I mean it's been a reminder, on your calendar for six months from now.

79
00:11:42.570 --> 00:11:53.820
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): I suppose what one reason to move it would be if we were in a situation where there are people actually using it, and they have problems they raise issues and nobody is there to respond to any of this right.

80
00:11:54.270 --> 00:12:10.110
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): Then it becomes really a problem and, and you know we are better off signaling to the Community don't expect any maintenance and that I think you have to go to end of life for that, but you know.

81
00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:16.350
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): Otherwise it doesn't seem to be the case, right now, so either way.

82
00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:33.270
Tracy Kuhrt: yeah I did just open up the github issues, the last issue that was reported was on November 16 2021 and the one prior to that July 22 2021 and there's 42 issues total that are open.

83
00:12:34.590 --> 00:12:47.940
Tracy Kuhrt: There are actually 22 pull requests that are also open the last one being from October 29 of 2021 and number of pull requests from before then.

84
00:12:49.590 --> 00:13:00.360
Tracy Kuhrt: So you know I, I guess, there are people still looking at this as, at least as of November, if they're opening issues against it, but you know.

85
00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:05.400
Tracy Kuhrt: I don't know that it's like an issue every day or something like that, but.

86
00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:06.900
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): yeah no, but I think it's.

87
00:13:07.650 --> 00:13:16.470
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): i'm glad you actually thought about looking into it, because that actually is, you know puts us in that situation that I will I will be worried about.

88
00:13:16.830 --> 00:13:20.280
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): Where people expect more than they should.

89
00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:27.660
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): Because we actually know nobody's going to deal with those beyond and then issues so.

90
00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:35.220
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): Then we're better off moving it sooner, rather than better so that the Community knows, they can't expect anything to happen.

91
00:13:36.510 --> 00:13:40.890
Tracy Kuhrt: Right i'm Dan Oh, I think you were first as far as raising him.

92
00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:52.770
Danno Ferrin: The guilt that existed kind of release if it's being maintained, right now, I mean maintained by the Community implies that there's a critical bug fix that someone could patch it and push it out, if it was critical.

93
00:13:57.270 --> 00:13:57.630
Tracy Kuhrt: Right.

94
00:13:58.860 --> 00:14:03.210
Ry Jones: That the what you just touched on was.

95
00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:18.030
Ry Jones: My whole interest that the whole reason that this this you know came to me to the, we need to deal with this was that there were a bunch of issues that were opened and addressed.

96
00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:34.740
Ry Jones: intel's are the the previous maintain errs were pretty clear that they're not going to do anything about it, they don't have the time or the focus on that project, there were a bunch of PRS that hadn't been you know looked at at all.

97
00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:42.540
Ry Jones: And it just it feels like a dead end for contributions, so I just the signaling of.

98
00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:50.400
Ry Jones: You know hey here's The thing that you might be able to use when, in fact, you know the the development effort is moved on to the CCC.

99
00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:56.580
Ry Jones: I just think it's it's it's poor form, but that was.

100
00:14:57.690 --> 00:15:02.220
Ry Jones: That was my primary interested, it was not having a dead end of contributors.

101
00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:08.100
Tracy Kuhrt: Right.

102
00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:22.950
Aruna S M: Sure, so I probably wanted to just read, I mean read through the replicated states right, so we are claiming that project, even though it's deprecate it we still have support from the Community.

103
00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:31.200
Aruna S M: For at least six months from them and it looks support could be in I guess we haven't defined what the support should be.

104
00:15:32.730 --> 00:15:34.380
Aruna S M: But if we are not getting that.

105
00:15:36.540 --> 00:15:40.290
Aruna S M: Then i'm in favor of moving away from the applicator.

106
00:15:44.250 --> 00:15:53.400
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): yeah and, if I may add to this, I mean the the composer project right went through this phase, but we had people still committed to.

107
00:15:53.910 --> 00:16:04.140
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): You know, dealing with this kind of PR issues and they say we're not going to make any further development on expecting movement, but you know we're here still.

108
00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:09.060
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): And so, that is a different situation here if we really have people.

109
00:16:09.870 --> 00:16:27.240
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): You know, nobody is going to respond to any of those, then I think we were doing a desert disservice to the Community by keeping it in this current stage prostate so that, as now convinced me that the right thing is to actually move it to end of life ASAP.

110
00:16:28.950 --> 00:16:35.280
Tracy Kuhrt: yeah and I think that's what day I was calling out specifically thinking when I brought this up.

111
00:16:35.670 --> 00:16:46.380
Tracy Kuhrt: Reading through the deprecate it, it does say at deprecating project will be maintained for a six month period by its Community after which it will be removed from any subsequent formal releases.

112
00:16:47.970 --> 00:16:59.070
Tracy Kuhrt: So I think that's the to me that's the key right, then it will be maintained for six months, and I know that it's not going to be for six months at this point, based on the discussions that we've had.

113
00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:02.610
So.

114
00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:15.750
Tracy Kuhrt: Okay um so i'll ask again now, after this discussion does anybody have a problem if we move this to end of life.

115
00:17:22.110 --> 00:17:22.590
Tracy Kuhrt: He came off.

116
00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:24.630
Hart Montgomery: versus gonna make emotion.

117
00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:26.190
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): Okay yeah.

118
00:17:26.940 --> 00:17:27.390
Tracy Kuhrt: We got one.

119
00:17:29.790 --> 00:17:31.410
Tracy Kuhrt: Second i'm.

120
00:17:32.910 --> 00:17:36.750
Tracy Kuhrt: Right, do you just want to run us through a gain any vote.

121
00:17:37.410 --> 00:17:42.960
Ry Jones: For saying I will i'll pick by the length of your name in unit.

122
00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:52.560
Ry Jones: Troy sure sorry the motion is to move the avalon project to end of life correct.

123
00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:53.580
Okay.

124
00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:55.740
Ry Jones: Troy, how do you vote.

125
00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:57.630
Ry Jones: Yes, Tracy.

126
00:17:58.530 --> 00:17:59.580
Ry Jones: Yes, Peter.

127
00:18:00.810 --> 00:18:01.320
Peter Somogyvari: Yes.

128
00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:01.920
Nathan.

129
00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:04.410
Nathan George: Yes.

130
00:18:05.910 --> 00:18:06.480
Kamlesh Nagware: Yes.

131
00:18:07.710 --> 00:18:09.060
Ry Jones: Jim is not here heart.

132
00:18:11.430 --> 00:18:11.940
Ry Jones: grace.

133
00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:13.470
Grace Hartley: Yes.

134
00:18:13.770 --> 00:18:15.150
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): David yes.

135
00:18:16.830 --> 00:18:17.280
Danno Ferrin: Yes.

136
00:18:17.370 --> 00:18:19.080
Bobbi Muscara: Bobby yes.

137
00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:21.210
Aruna S M: Yes.

138
00:18:21.870 --> 00:18:23.850
Ry Jones: Artem is not here, or no.

139
00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:26.430
Ry Jones: Yes, Angela.

140
00:18:26.970 --> 00:18:30.630
Ry Jones: Yes, well, the motion passes.

141
00:18:32.250 --> 00:18:38.700
Tracy Kuhrt: Thanks everyone for that I didn't know we were actually going to have a decision on that, but i'm glad that we did.

142
00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:42.660
Tracy Kuhrt: So a real question.

143
00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:57.210
Aruna S M: Right, I still want to keep one question open, that we should have identify the project to enter into dormant and probably that's an area to focus on in project reports because there is also a discussion that.

144
00:18:58.950 --> 00:19:04.170
Aruna S M: that's currently happening by between dano and heart on the chat channel is built on the same topic.

145
00:19:06.420 --> 00:19:09.030
Tracy Kuhrt: Okay, I haven't been paying attention to the chat channel.

146
00:19:19.410 --> 00:19:21.330
Tracy Kuhrt: yeah I do think that this question of.

147
00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:25.680
Tracy Kuhrt: Government state and what do we do with projects, who are not reporting.

148
00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:30.180
Tracy Kuhrt: It still it's still an open issue in our backlog.

149
00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:35.100
Tracy Kuhrt: I think you know we hadn't necessarily come to any sort of decision or.

150
00:19:36.630 --> 00:19:38.010
Tracy Kuhrt: direction on that.

151
00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:47.850
Tracy Kuhrt: Other than to maybe take a step back for a moment and and think some more about it before we made any radical decisions.

152
00:19:49.620 --> 00:20:00.330
Tracy Kuhrt: Pay patients, I guess, as Nathan says this is kind of the direction that we were going to take where the time being, but I do think it's an important sort of discussion for us to have.

153
00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:13.830
Tracy Kuhrt: As long as you know, and I guess the that follows on to this question of the second question that I have related to the project life cycle that Ryan brought to us.

154
00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:27.000
Tracy Kuhrt: Which is once a project moves to dormant how long, should it stay there before we consider moving it to deprecate slash in the life type state.

155
00:20:31.410 --> 00:20:40.860
Tracy Kuhrt: Because I think that the challenge that we have right now, and one of the reasons that I did leave bro on the upcoming reports, even though it's dormant is that.

156
00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:51.390
Tracy Kuhrt: If it project truly is dormant and nobody's looking at it it's hard to know what we should do with it, do we ever plan on coming out of that dormant stage or.

157
00:20:52.590 --> 00:21:00.660
Tracy Kuhrt: Is it really that the project kind of went to an end of life state and is using dormant as a way of getting around the end of life state.

158
00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:10.680
Tracy Kuhrt: Not necessarily on purpose, but because it seemed to make sense at the time, and then it just never comes back around to to have a further discussion so heart.

159
00:21:13.170 --> 00:21:30.330
Hart Montgomery: Thanks Tracy, so I think the ideal way to use dormant state is to say something like Okay, you know we're shutting down this project, we know many of you, you know we know there are a lot of external dependencies on this project right.

160
00:21:31.350 --> 00:21:39.540
Hart Montgomery: You know now's the time to switch to find something to switch to right either like take the parts of the code, you need to incorporate them into your project.

161
00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:51.480
Hart Montgomery: Or to move to a different project right, so I don't know that we want to define the the amount of time, a project should be in the dormant state, because in sort of the like right way that this plays out.

162
00:21:54.330 --> 00:22:03.270
Hart Montgomery: It the dormant state is is dependent on sort of how long the maintainer of the project in the dormant state are willing to push critical fixes.

163
00:22:03.930 --> 00:22:17.790
Hart Montgomery: And how long it takes people that are dependent on the dormant project to to move and eliminate dependencies on the dormant project, one of the nice things we have about avalon is that there don't appear to be a lot of.

164
00:22:19.530 --> 00:22:23.970
Hart Montgomery: systems at least production systems or high value things that depend on avalon.

165
00:22:25.290 --> 00:22:32.040
Hart Montgomery: So it's not a huge deal if production stops, but if if sort of.

166
00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:41.370
Hart Montgomery: If work stopped on you know some of the more popular projects in hyper ledger I think it would be a much more tricky conversation.

167
00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:44.100
Hart Montgomery: I hope that made sense.

168
00:22:45.150 --> 00:22:46.560
Tracy Kuhrt: yeah and just a.

169
00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:51.240
Tracy Kuhrt: phone call and you just to comment on that quickly.

170
00:22:52.770 --> 00:22:57.780
Tracy Kuhrt: One of the one of the projects, we have two projects internal state right now, one is quilt in one is bro.

171
00:22:59.220 --> 00:23:16.740
Tracy Kuhrt: If you look at the the project reports that the TC quarterly reports, but the project reports that right has provided for us, you can see that there has been zero kits in the last six months, and only one in the last year, and so you know at what point.

172
00:23:17.790 --> 00:23:30.900
Tracy Kuhrt: Do we say like quilt maintenance, even though you went away, how do you come back to us and tell us what's going on right there's there's no way to revisit that I don't think at this point, you know.

173
00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:39.270
Danno Ferrin: So i've got a difference between the dormant state in the dedicated state is that dormant is kind of reversible deprecation.

174
00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:46.320
Danno Ferrin: And it's you know the project saying we may come back and, by the way, maintain there's wanted if someone wants to take it over.

175
00:23:46.740 --> 00:23:52.980
Danno Ferrin: Please take it over that would be an option, but when I see deprecate it, you know I see, this is a project that will be coming back and it's not.

176
00:23:53.280 --> 00:24:00.960
Danno Ferrin: You know it's not just you know suggested that you find things to get off it's like practically requirement, you need to get off because it's going to end and.

177
00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:14.160
Danno Ferrin: So i've you know the deprecate, it is a one way in Norman is a two way if you know they can fix their governance or if it's a commitment issue if they can get gather the time that they need to to commit to it properly.

178
00:24:14.670 --> 00:24:21.870
Danno Ferrin: Or if someone else wants to come in and provide assistance so that's what I see these two guys that's the two things run through my mind.

179
00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:30.180
Danno Ferrin: As far as the way it's set up so that may figure into our decision on when we move it to deprecate AOL for the dorm and it's like nobody's stepping up.

180
00:24:30.930 --> 00:24:37.890
Danno Ferrin: After you know, rather than a fixed period if we could you know, at some point, but they do need to get out of dormant they can't stay there perpetually.

181
00:24:40.890 --> 00:24:41.130
Danno Ferrin: Right.

182
00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:50.040
Nathan George: I think it's important for us to emphasize that it's not healthy for them to stay in perpetually.

183
00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:57.930
Nathan George: If they insisted that it was the right place for them to be and they're still active active enough to respond to our questions about them still being.

184
00:24:58.650 --> 00:25:08.850
Nathan George: In dormant in a way that's helpful to them, I don't know that we actually have an abuse problem there be so long as they're still active enough that dormant is true.

185
00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:21.540
Nathan George: And then it's a review step for us to make sure, as the tlc that you know we're helping them either leave dormant or or come to that conclusion that they need to finally let go of.

186
00:25:22.530 --> 00:25:26.220
Nathan George: A lot of these states are self fulfilling prophecies and some ways, meaning.

187
00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:37.680
Nathan George: You know if they're dormant people who might contribute over my help come and say Oh, but this is dharma did i'm not really prepared to take on the whole project i'm going to move on and it creates critical mass elsewhere.

188
00:25:38.310 --> 00:25:47.910
Nathan George: And part of what we want, with the truth in these states is the critical mass can stay at hyper ledger in one way or another, to help our overall development of our mission so.

189
00:25:48.990 --> 00:25:56.310
Nathan George: If being dormant helps them to do that, that I think we would rather keep a project dormant that just you know dismiss the maintainer swishes.

190
00:25:57.450 --> 00:26:09.180
Nathan George: So I think it, we need to be careful we don't make the states so rigid that we we are shoving the maintainer is along to say you've got to be here you've got to be there.

191
00:26:09.930 --> 00:26:19.890
Nathan George: I think we, we always wanted this project status to be a tool to help the maintainer to get the things that they need most and.

192
00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:32.910
Nathan George: If borough stays dormant for much longer, what they need most is probably watch for dorman and that's a conversation will want to have with them as we bring up the status and in our regular cadence.

193
00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:39.570
Tracy Kuhrt: yeah I think that we don't necessarily have that regular cadence.

194
00:26:40.140 --> 00:26:51.900
Tracy Kuhrt: Because I don't think we made it clear for the projects in bro and during the during the state what the responsibilities actually are, and I think that's My biggest concern at this point or do.

195
00:26:54.750 --> 00:27:13.410
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): So I just wanted to share, I mean I actually attended the euro Community call it was part of you know, fulfilling my duty as a Member that I need to check on other projects, so I did it before the end of the mouth yeah.

196
00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:26.550
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): You can you can tap me on the back, no bad so The thing is, it was actually interesting because they were talking about the fact that they are actually using borough.

197
00:27:26.970 --> 00:27:35.250
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): And they were not aware that borough as actually moved out of you know incubation state into dormant so I informed them on that.

198
00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:47.730
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): And I said, you probably need to figure out what that means for you and I imagine one possibilities for them to say okay we're going to take over the pod that we use right.

199
00:27:49.260 --> 00:27:54.990
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): And so I don't know what that means exactly in terms of the question at hand, but I wanted to share this because.

200
00:27:55.530 --> 00:28:14.820
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): This is not something that we have faced before where there is a project that moving out of you know, active status, so to speak, and and they are actually dependencies so it's going to impact all the projects in this case, you know he wrote uses it.

201
00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:19.200
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): And they were shocked, they were like oh thanks for telling us.

202
00:28:23.370 --> 00:28:24.150
Tracy Kuhrt: yeah that's.

203
00:28:25.500 --> 00:28:42.870
Tracy Kuhrt: that's interesting right, because I think that goes the opposite way to which is the people in other people know that I was using perl right like I didn't know that burrow into doing it, but if people know that I was using perl until you said that, I know I didn't know that.

204
00:28:45.150 --> 00:28:45.690
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): either.

205
00:28:48.870 --> 00:28:57.540
Tracy Kuhrt: dependencies Maybe other that we, we are not aware of that, we probably should be aware of, as we, as we go through, and think about this.

206
00:29:00.330 --> 00:29:00.990
Tracy Kuhrt: So.

207
00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:13.560
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): And, in passing, just to highlight it shows the fact that I didn't know you didn't know I you know it shows the value of actually you know, having a look at what's going on in these other projects, just like we had decided.

208
00:29:14.850 --> 00:29:17.670
Tracy Kuhrt: Yes, gold star, for I don't know anyone.

209
00:29:23.490 --> 00:29:24.000
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): I thought it was.

210
00:29:24.150 --> 00:29:24.930
interesting.

211
00:29:26.790 --> 00:29:35.820
Tracy Kuhrt: You know your hand is still up I don't know if that's because you have something you're it just hasn't gone down yet Okay, thank you say, for you know your hand is still up.

212
00:29:41.220 --> 00:29:57.630
Tracy Kuhrt: So yeah I agree, I think the key here right is how do we, how do we stay involved with the projects that have gone dormant to ensure that we understand what State actually makes sense for them.

213
00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:01.890
Tracy Kuhrt: And I don't think we've run across this yet.

214
00:30:02.910 --> 00:30:17.610
Tracy Kuhrt: I think we had built as a project update that was it came do I think we ended up removing it from the agenda, because we were like well it's done it we probably won't expect an update from them, so we removed it.

215
00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:25.500
Tracy Kuhrt: I guess, my question is, should we have done that, or should we have tried to reach out to the folks to see kind of what their state is.

216
00:30:26.910 --> 00:30:39.450
Tracy Kuhrt: and, obviously, this question is going to come up for borough I think obviously just let us know about that so maybe it's not as critical with bro at this point, they have that follow up conversation of hey are you still in dormant or.

217
00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:51.750
Tracy Kuhrt: doesn't make sense to think about a different state but i'd like to make sure that we we are having those follow up conversations with the the maintainer of the projects that are in.

218
00:30:53.250 --> 00:30:53.730
Tracy Kuhrt: Peter.

219
00:30:55.980 --> 00:30:56.790
Peter Somogyvari: What if we.

220
00:30:58.860 --> 00:31:09.000
Peter Somogyvari: decided on one member of the tasc being a liaison and supplies happens, it will be always say or see but someone could volunteer.

221
00:31:09.900 --> 00:31:21.060
Peter Somogyvari: And then, when something like this comes up on a project start struggle and then be with assign somebody to to have an open communication Channel with them.

222
00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:35.310
Peter Somogyvari: So that they are in the know, as it happens, and then you're not just sort of trying to piece together a picture, based on the quarterly reports themselves and then what's the last command That was the last issue.

223
00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:47.220
Peter Somogyvari: Because, ultimately, if Sorry, I think it makes a huge difference of what they say and what they believe.

224
00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:57.270
Peter Somogyvari: This huge difference because maybe there hasn't been a commit for six months, but if they say yeah we were out for six months, but now they're back full swing.

225
00:31:58.230 --> 00:32:07.020
Peter Somogyvari: that's very different from them saying yeah we're out for six months and honestly, we feel like this is how it's going to be from now on.

226
00:32:11.550 --> 00:32:12.150
Peter Somogyvari: yeah I like.

227
00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:27.840
Tracy Kuhrt: I like the idea Peter have you know, do we want to start the song student projects that seem like they're struggling projects that have gone into domain, which would like the question of should we be assigning a liaison for the explorer group.

228
00:32:29.340 --> 00:32:41.160
Tracy Kuhrt: You know, to work with, obviously, the staff with doing a lot of work already around that but also with the folks who are currently listed as mediators of the explorer project.

229
00:32:42.690 --> 00:32:43.140
Tracy Kuhrt: heart.

230
00:32:44.790 --> 00:32:45.480
Hart Montgomery: Thanks Tracy.

231
00:32:46.650 --> 00:32:55.770
Hart Montgomery: I also don't know that we need to you know it may not be the case that sort of going to through dormant maybe default.

232
00:32:56.910 --> 00:33:12.120
Hart Montgomery: My view on this is sort of the dormant is the route for projects that sort of want to have a planned or graceful obsolescence and if you know the maintainer is just sort of disappear, we can just go ahead and move the project to end of life.

233
00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:20.760
Hart Montgomery: Because that's more indicative of the fact that the project isn't going to be supported at all.

234
00:33:25.740 --> 00:33:28.500
Tracy Kuhrt: yeah I just decided I maybe you when you said that.

235
00:33:29.130 --> 00:33:34.650
Tracy Kuhrt: It would be good to read what dormant state was when we decided to introduce the state.

236
00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:43.020
Tracy Kuhrt: So projects and adored state or ones in which normal functions are suspended or slow down for a period of time.

237
00:33:44.610 --> 00:33:54.630
Tracy Kuhrt: etc will make a decision whether project removed to or from donut state, upon request, if Darren projects become reactivated they will re enter information, even if they.

238
00:33:55.350 --> 00:34:07.560
Tracy Kuhrt: turn it from the graduate see we don't really say what happens when they're not going to be reactivated right or what that period of time is that we expect them.

239
00:34:08.580 --> 00:34:16.380
Tracy Kuhrt: To be slowed down or suspended, and I think you know, maybe that's that was bad on us to not be very clear about that.

240
00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:33.180
Tracy Kuhrt: But I do think, now that we have the examples, maybe it's time for us to revisit kind of what what that period of time is that we expect the three dormant so that we can then make better decisions about what to do with these projects right.

241
00:34:34.830 --> 00:34:52.680
Tracy Kuhrt: So yeah, I think, maybe there's more that we can do around this particular State, as well as having discussions with both the borough and the quote folks to see kind of what their expectations are for the dormant state.

242
00:34:56.400 --> 00:35:08.100
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): So, if I may, the I don't think we should have like a hard limit saying you know after six months if a project in Dortmund state we move them.

243
00:35:08.580 --> 00:35:14.580
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): to duplicate it, though end of life, what we could say is as a kind of.

244
00:35:15.150 --> 00:35:20.880
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): You know, we could have a policy that says, you know after six months we will have.

245
00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:31.560
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): We will check on the status and that would imply to me that we are coming somebody at least, you know as a communication with the maintainer of the project say hey.

246
00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:38.970
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): what's the status should we still keep that in dominance they do you still think you will come back or should we move it.

247
00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:50.070
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): And then, in the case where nobody answers well that's an answer in and of itself, we can make a decision based on that, but if you know we I think there is some.

248
00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:58.830
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): There is some value in keeping it flexible because we might have somebody was very specific thing where they say hey for the next three months.

249
00:35:59.130 --> 00:36:11.550
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): We are building on something else, I will be back for sure, and we should allow that and, and so I think you know I wouldn't favor having a hard limit in built into this.

250
00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:25.050
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): I do think we should have a policy that says, after some time you know some amount of months we we make the point of reaching out to the maintainer and check on the status.

251
00:36:26.670 --> 00:36:36.660
Tracy Kuhrt: yeah I agree, and I think everybody, at least from what i've heard is probably an agreement with that as well, I didn't hear anybody say like I know we should be shutting down right now right.

252
00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:45.210
Tracy Kuhrt: I do think, though, that, as a next step for this discussion, it probably is important for us to reach out to the.

253
00:36:47.040 --> 00:37:00.660
Tracy Kuhrt: folks and find out kind of where they're at just make sure they're they're still you know good with donors that they expected to still come back and spend some time on this, or what the right next steps are for them.

254
00:37:05.070 --> 00:37:06.030
Tracy Kuhrt: Okay, any other.

255
00:37:06.180 --> 00:37:07.500
Tracy Kuhrt: thoughts on this topic.

256
00:37:08.670 --> 00:37:10.050
Tracy Kuhrt: I think you know.

257
00:37:11.970 --> 00:37:14.460
Tracy Kuhrt: I can take the action item to reject the quilt.

258
00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:17.880
Tracy Kuhrt: In find out what's going on.

259
00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:21.300
Tracy Kuhrt: With their project and, hopefully, report back.

260
00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:28.920
Tracy Kuhrt: Alright, see no.

261
00:37:30.060 --> 00:37:43.110
Tracy Kuhrt: hands, I will move us on to the next section which are these project reports that i'd like to thank Ryan, for taking the time to provide a github action.

262
00:37:45.060 --> 00:37:51.120
Tracy Kuhrt: To run the hyper ledger Community management tools project reports.

263
00:37:52.710 --> 00:37:53.130
Tracy Kuhrt: code.

264
00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:58.890
Tracy Kuhrt: So yeah definitely let's take a look at these these project reports right.

265
00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:01.560
Tracy Kuhrt: and

266
00:38:03.270 --> 00:38:11.700
Tracy Kuhrt: I think that the question that I have really is, do we find the information in this these sorts of reports useful.

267
00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:20.190
Tracy Kuhrt: Do we want to run these on a regular basis, so that we can have additional information.

268
00:38:22.290 --> 00:38:29.730
Tracy Kuhrt: In addition to the quarterly reports that the projects are providing to us or.

269
00:38:30.930 --> 00:38:35.880
Tracy Kuhrt: You know, are these something that we don't think are really that useful for us.

270
00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:42.030
Tracy Kuhrt: Still building right.

271
00:38:42.510 --> 00:38:51.930
Ry Jones: yeah I know I have a copy of it on my machine i'm just trying to find where exactly I dropped the thing.

272
00:38:56.190 --> 00:38:58.230
Tracy Kuhrt: While you're looking for that Jim you're handed up.

273
00:38:59.190 --> 00:39:01.590
Jim Zhang: yeah thanks Tracy i'm.

274
00:39:02.820 --> 00:39:12.570
Jim Zhang: just trying to understand the the reports they are based on the insights dimensions Is that correct just making that static.

275
00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:29.970
Tracy Kuhrt: So not really um so what they are, they use the github API to provide to pull information specifically from github about the contributions that have been made.

276
00:39:30.990 --> 00:39:38.820
Tracy Kuhrt: To a particular project in this case the the one that's been shown is your earnings report looking at.

277
00:39:39.810 --> 00:39:57.360
Tracy Kuhrt: A number of different sorts of things around the project such as the total contributors for the life of the project, the contributors that have existed for the past year, the number of active contributors which are contributors who made at least one country should, in the past six months.

278
00:39:58.380 --> 00:40:13.020
Tracy Kuhrt: How many obviously like it's 259 minus in one I hope is 178 those are the inactive future dinners the new contributors are contributors who made their first contribution in the past month.

279
00:40:14.370 --> 00:40:23.310
Tracy Kuhrt: So, in the case of areas, there was one new contributor this past month repeat contributors people have had more than one contribution.

280
00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:36.600
Tracy Kuhrt: For the life of the project core contributors are those who have contributed 80% of the code um so there's actually 28 core contributors are 10% of the total contributors who.

281
00:40:37.620 --> 00:40:53.460
Tracy Kuhrt: have contributed the 80% of the code regular contributors are those who contributed 95% of the go, obviously, those are the core contributors plus submit initial folks and you've got the casual contributors.

282
00:40:55.530 --> 00:40:58.560
Tracy Kuhrt: which I don't know what the footnote says, but.

283
00:40:59.610 --> 00:41:01.080
Tracy Kuhrt: Those are people who.

284
00:41:04.380 --> 00:41:11.820
Tracy Kuhrt: Number six the regular contributors contribute 95 i'm sorry casual contributors, must be the 5% the other 5%.

285
00:41:13.350 --> 00:41:24.180
Tracy Kuhrt: And then just some some information that takes those numbers and divided them apart, to try and figure out, you know what the retention rate of contributors in the level of engagement it's been.

286
00:41:25.260 --> 00:41:35.730
Tracy Kuhrt: You know how many people have done repeat contributions and then just the specific details behind each of those kind of numbers that summary so.

287
00:41:36.630 --> 00:41:46.800
Tracy Kuhrt: You know, if you look at this for Aries Aries looks pretty healthy right they've got 81 active contributors in the last six months they're still getting new contributors, they have.

288
00:41:48.180 --> 00:41:57.240
Tracy Kuhrt: You know, not out of all of our contributors only 10% of core contributors, it seems pretty good, because that means there's like.

289
00:41:58.500 --> 00:42:08.760
Tracy Kuhrt: Maybe it would be helpful if it was a higher number I don't know, but I think you know the question here is how useful that we think this is to help us understand kind of the health of the project vs.

290
00:42:09.570 --> 00:42:16.350
Tracy Kuhrt: If you were to look at say the quote one, it says the contributors in the past year was three and they.

291
00:42:18.480 --> 00:42:26.730
Tracy Kuhrt: Nobody That was the That was the avalon one so Cohen says contributors in the past year one active contributors in the last six months zero.

292
00:42:27.180 --> 00:42:45.750
Tracy Kuhrt: Right that's I think the this sort of thing that we're looking at here is just to try and figure out with numbers kind of the health of the project, we think the project reports are leading us astray, but the maintainer Czar providing us that sort of thing.

293
00:42:47.430 --> 00:42:48.090
Tracy Kuhrt: That helped you.

294
00:42:48.900 --> 00:42:59.490
Jim Zhang: yeah that helps a lot thanks Tracy I think this is a very useful dimension in terms of the contributors, whether they're growing maintaining or dropping.

295
00:42:59.910 --> 00:43:10.470
Jim Zhang: For a project that's sort of had has been established, so we know you know, are they maintaining their their actors, but.

296
00:43:11.100 --> 00:43:21.990
Jim Zhang: For new projects that are still trying to grow their contributors, I think this can be quite misleading, so I wonder where I i'm thinking, a new project is.

297
00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:45.330
Jim Zhang: very actively in committee, but not necessarily in growing the contributors, because you know it's it's still the core contributors that can understand architecture it's hard for for new people to to jump in just yet, so I wonder if we can also do PR and commit based that I think.

298
00:43:46.410 --> 00:43:48.780
Jim Zhang: better reflect new projects.

299
00:43:51.390 --> 00:44:00.210
Ry Jones: I have all the projects, I have, I have all the projects reports now the current ones which which one do you want me to bring up.

300
00:44:01.830 --> 00:44:11.220
Jim Zhang: I wonder if we look at, for example, bevel or firefly the two newest ones we may see.

301
00:44:14.100 --> 00:44:15.930
Jim Zhang: yeah so.

302
00:44:17.430 --> 00:44:20.280
Jim Zhang: I think what this says is.

303
00:44:24.240 --> 00:44:28.860
Jim Zhang: New contributors, and so I don't know how to interpret this but.

304
00:44:30.270 --> 00:44:39.210
Jim Zhang: It doesn't reflect that there are 100 commits going on every week, you know stuff like that how active the project is.

305
00:44:41.640 --> 00:44:45.270
Jim Zhang: Even though the number of contributors is not growing necessarily.

306
00:44:48.660 --> 00:44:57.270
Tracy Kuhrt: Yes, I think, Jim any sort of github api's that are available could be included in this report.

307
00:44:57.540 --> 00:44:58.980
Tracy Kuhrt: As far yeah yeah we.

308
00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:09.870
Tracy Kuhrt: PR or issues or things like that right, like, I think we can definitely include those it's not it's not a major issue.

309
00:45:11.430 --> 00:45:16.830
Tracy Kuhrt: This is this code that generating these reports is open source it's a it's part of the labs.

310
00:45:18.030 --> 00:45:23.610
Tracy Kuhrt: So if we decide that you know there's anything that we want to add, we can definitely add to that.

311
00:45:25.020 --> 00:45:25.530
Jim Zhang: that'd be great.

312
00:45:28.860 --> 00:45:38.940
Tracy Kuhrt: Any other thoughts on these project reports do we find them useful, are they something that we'd like to you know see scheduled on a monthly basis, so we can take a look at them.

313
00:45:39.660 --> 00:45:50.910
Tracy Kuhrt: offline not necessarily in the PC call but definitely offline just to see what's going on with projects and see if there's anything that is stepping out or jumping out is hurt.

314
00:45:51.930 --> 00:45:59.220
Hart Montgomery: Be Tracy so I know the the cnc F has like a really nice sort of like update summary template.

315
00:46:00.510 --> 00:46:06.750
Hart Montgomery: which has a lot of Nice contributor statistics i'm not sure that monthly is the right time period to look at things.

316
00:46:07.020 --> 00:46:08.190
Just because.

317
00:46:09.690 --> 00:46:30.510
Hart Montgomery: there's so much flux flux just based on the month of the year, like i'm sure you know, December contributions are going to be much, much, much lower than other months or things like that, so it might be hard to read you know just a monthly data if that makes sense.

318
00:46:31.890 --> 00:46:36.780
Tracy Kuhrt: yeah yep we can consider doesn't make sense to run them on a quarterly basis to get.

319
00:46:38.850 --> 00:46:40.890
Tracy Kuhrt: The information or even run them.

320
00:46:42.060 --> 00:46:50.010
Tracy Kuhrt: right before the project update is due to us, you know these are all sorts of things that we could discuss Angela.

321
00:46:52.500 --> 00:47:05.010
Angelo De Caro: Thank you Tracy I think in the same line no heart said woody woody impossible to have a plot of the evolution of the projects over time, instead of having a snapshot of the single month.

322
00:47:05.310 --> 00:47:15.120
Angelo De Caro: Because that will tell us about trends so it's growing overall you know we don't look at the peaks we just look at the trends which what we care about is.

323
00:47:17.970 --> 00:47:24.330
Tracy Kuhrt: yep and I think you know the yeah insights tells us some of that, I think.

324
00:47:26.220 --> 00:47:29.910
Tracy Kuhrt: Maybe we can pull you know some of this information into.

325
00:47:31.350 --> 00:47:33.300
Tracy Kuhrt: Our project updates as well.

326
00:47:34.740 --> 00:47:35.160
Tracy Kuhrt: Peter.

327
00:47:37.920 --> 00:47:49.350
Peter Somogyvari: I also think it's a good idea, as long as it's definitely fully automated so that no one has to prepare this report regularly by hand and then the second part of what I wanted to say is that.

328
00:47:50.430 --> 00:48:06.180
Peter Somogyvari: They could have additional metrics and they're not sure, yet which ones, but they could call with metrics that would serve as early indicators of dormancy and i'm not saying that we should the.

329
00:48:07.410 --> 00:48:17.610
Peter Somogyvari: Projects in the one and see based on the metrics i'm just saying that this could also feed into that liaison appointment idea that I had.

330
00:48:18.150 --> 00:48:33.810
Peter Somogyvari: If we see that the numbers are going down or have gone down like we could catch that and this project has been no commits for the past three months, we need to point in this on and send them over to the project and talk to them about what's happening.

331
00:48:35.970 --> 00:48:42.360
Tracy Kuhrt: yeah definitely agree 100% I made it don't want to have to do this.

332
00:48:43.890 --> 00:48:53.670
Tracy Kuhrt: as well, so I think that's you know some of the challenge that we have with the insights right now is that it is a manual process for somebody to go find the lake and.

333
00:48:55.290 --> 00:49:12.600
Tracy Kuhrt: You know, even if we were to try and copy this stuff from insights it's still manual process to copy, so I definitely want to go with the, how can we automate what it is and yeah if there are specific trends that people know about that will lend itself to.

334
00:49:14.010 --> 00:49:27.300
Tracy Kuhrt: hey something is starting to shift with this project and maybe we need to take a closer look, I think those are things that yeah let's bring up and let's try and get them out here, so we can take a look, oh no.

335
00:49:30.780 --> 00:49:40.830
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): yeah, I just wanted to have a word of caution there, I mean I we don't want to go down the route of reinventing insights either right, I mean i'm sure.

336
00:49:41.820 --> 00:49:45.720
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): Greed the train would be nice a graphic to show it would be nice.

337
00:49:45.990 --> 00:49:58.980
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): But you know it's a slippery slope before you know everybody's going to say Oh, I would like this dimension, you know and what about this and that, and then we are basically reinventing insights as be careful not to go too far.

338
00:49:59.820 --> 00:50:15.360
Tracy Kuhrt: yeah yeah I agree, I know we don't want to recreate the wheel, there are so many tools out there right now provide you with graphs and charts of the way then what's the Open Source stuff work, I think it was awesome I shared.

339
00:50:16.530 --> 00:50:21.990
Tracy Kuhrt: In a new tool that I hadn't seen before What was it last week a couple weeks ago so.

340
00:50:23.160 --> 00:50:25.500
Tracy Kuhrt: 100% agree on Bobby.

341
00:50:28.290 --> 00:50:35.610
Bobbi Muscara: Yes, thank you Tracy, I just wanted to point out that the learning materials working group captures this information for each one of the projects and tools.

342
00:50:36.450 --> 00:50:51.360
Bobbi Muscara: Every time the quarterly report comes out I just put a link in the chat and for an example for firefly but under resources in learning materials working group, all this information is captured by us so just to let you know it's there.

343
00:50:54.870 --> 00:50:55.200
Tracy Kuhrt: But.

344
00:50:57.210 --> 00:50:58.800
Ry Jones: I wanted to.

345
00:51:00.630 --> 00:51:17.040
Ry Jones: give everyone that's not aware of the context, some some context here, this is a tool that you know Tracy wrote like I don't know 10 years ago and we didn't have insights at that time yeah this this this predates.

346
00:51:19.200 --> 00:51:20.220
Ry Jones: A lot of the tools.

347
00:51:21.660 --> 00:51:23.550
Ry Jones: So you know it's a.

348
00:51:24.660 --> 00:51:25.560
Ry Jones: pull request.

349
00:51:26.610 --> 00:51:32.520
Ry Jones: would be great, but I also agree, we shouldn't try to reinvent insights so.

350
00:51:34.260 --> 00:51:41.370
Tracy Kuhrt: yeah yeah definitely not 10 years ago, but I mean you know I can't tell you how long ago it was.

351
00:51:42.840 --> 00:51:46.650
Tracy Kuhrt: it's been a while it was when I was part of the hyper ledger staff.

352
00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:54.300
Tracy Kuhrt: trying to figure out kind of understanding our projects and that sort of thing it just never, never took off.

353
00:51:55.980 --> 00:52:03.210

356
00:52:16.500 --> 00:52:20.310

00:54:34.650 --> 00:54:42.690
Tracy Kuhrt: Speaking of task forces, did you would think it was useful to have a task force to to try and figure this out as a separate sort of group.

381
00:54:43.440 --> 00:54:57.600
Jim Zhang: yeah I feel like there are a few fewer clear direction, so we can go into directly so maybe we can self organize and see if a task force specific task forces is needed, maybe we consult with a.
