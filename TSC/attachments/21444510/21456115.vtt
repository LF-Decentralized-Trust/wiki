Tracy Kuhrt: hyper ledger technical steering committee call, as you are probably all aware, two things that we must abide by the first one is the antitrust policy notice that is currently being displayed on the screen and the second is the code of conduct, which is linked in our agenda.

9
00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:30.960
Tracy Kuhrt: So agenda today, we have our standard announcement, the hyper ledger that weekly developer newsletter goes out each Friday.

Tracy Kuhrt: Are there other announcements that anybody would like to make.

Tracy Kuhrt: The area's in in the reports came in, I did not see anything specific coming up on those particular.

14
00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:31.050
Tracy Kuhrt: Project reports, although I do see that there's still some empty check marks that people haven't had a chance to review them yet so.

15
00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:42.750
Tracy Kuhrt: I think we'll just kind of take the opportunity to ask during this call if there's any questions or comments anybody, like to make regarding the areas are in the report.

16
00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:56.340
Tracy Kuhrt: Okay, I see no hands, nobody come off mute I take that as a no.

17
00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:15.510
Tracy Kuhrt: So please, if you haven't had a chance to review those yet, please take the opportunity to do that and the, as I mentioned the 01 has come in already for us to take a look at Thank you to the real high team for getting that in, and we will take a look at that next week.

18
00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:21.600
Tracy Kuhrt: When everybody has had an opportunity to to take a look at that.

Tracy Kuhrt: Just fyi we have the devil report that's also due next week and the other two reports that are listed here we're going to actually be talking about blow, so we will get to those discussions here shortly.

20
00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:40.800
Tracy Kuhrt: Any questions at this point about the quarterly reports.

21
00:05:47.910 --> 00:06:06.930
Tracy Kuhrt: Okay, good um So the first item that we have is a couple of decisions, the first one is the default maintainer activity policy that then i'll update it for us, based on our discussion last week, I have seen that there are.

22
00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:18.990
Tracy Kuhrt: Six yeses check marks plus their nose is seven, and I think complex, you also commented, which makes that eight approvals.

23
00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:23.640
Tracy Kuhrt: In the actual PR and.

24
00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:26.580
Tracy Kuhrt: Then i'll see you cannot.

25
00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:31.350
Danno Ferrin: yeah one day they haven't put in that became an actor opens up.

26
00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:33.210
Danno Ferrin: Was there a request to clarify.

27
00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:35.070
Danno Ferrin: Who sends the.

28
00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:37.530
Danno Ferrin: PR to.

29
00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:55.200
Danno Ferrin: build us to move people to America status, and I want to change that to say it's the tasc or whoever the tasc chair designates um I think I mentioned that in chat do you want that, as a separate PR we roll that in with this one with a voice vote to approve that clarification.

30
00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:02.850
Tracy Kuhrt: I think i'm fine with the rolling it in I.

31
00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:04.620
Tracy Kuhrt: don't get any problems with that.

32
00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:11.880
Tracy Kuhrt: Since I think we're gonna do a voice foot here anyway anybody have any objections to then i'll making that change.

33
00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:22.440
Danno Ferrin: The verbs and good in our any tasc member of hyper ledger staff may file the pull request.

34
00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:24.690
Tracy Kuhrt: Okay.

35
00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:31.410
Tracy Kuhrt: Any objections to that particular change during in.

36
00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:36.000
Tracy Kuhrt: Other than what is already there and then voted on.

37
00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:42.420
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): Please let's not have another PR just for.

38
00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:42.630
The.

39
00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:44.130
Danno Ferrin: Right.

40
00:07:45.780 --> 00:08:00.510
Tracy Kuhrt: Good good all right so expect you to make that change do we feel like we need a formal vote here, or do we feel like the we've got the majority of people who have voted and maybe we haven't I guess that what did I put eight right.

41
00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:04.500
Ry Jones: I don't count.

42
00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:06.840
Tracy Kuhrt: yeah I think as a.

43
00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:17.820
Tracy Kuhrt: As a yes, so what is obviously above majority so i'm going to assume unless anybody has any objections to that we will.

44
00:08:19.530 --> 00:08:22.740
Tracy Kuhrt: Go ahead and allow Ghana, to make that change in burgesses.

45
00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:25.620
Chinoy, Vinita M.: I have a question.

46
00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:28.230
Chinoy, Vinita M.: As to I mean just.

47
00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:34.860
Chinoy, Vinita M.: For my knowledge as to what is the timeframe that is considered inactive before you.

48
00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:37.020
Chinoy, Vinita M.: Remove the maintainer.

49
00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:40.050
Chinoy, Vinita M.: Like right permissions for the maintainer.

50
00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:44.070
Danno Ferrin: was three months, six months.

51
00:08:45.270 --> 00:08:47.280
Danno Ferrin: of activity that's written into the policy.

52
00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:52.290
Danno Ferrin: A calm before there was no policy there was just writing other projects to do it.

53
00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:57.030
Chinoy, Vinita M.: Every six months okay that's all those wanted to thank you.

54
00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:06.450
Tracy Kuhrt: Okay, any just last call any objections to dental merging listen.

55
00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:15.930
Tracy Kuhrt: All right, no, you have to go ahead to make that change and emerging in.

56
00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:23.130
Tracy Kuhrt: The next item is also a decision.

57
00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:32.820
Tracy Kuhrt: To move hyper ledger bro to an end of life state, so, as you may recall back at the beginning of the year, we had a discussion.

58
00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:36.120
Tracy Kuhrt: With silas and.

59
00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:43.860
Tracy Kuhrt: Casey promote X about hyper ledger borough at that point they want it to move it to a dormant state.

60
00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:59.460
Tracy Kuhrt: Since hyper ledger broken up as leading a project report you I did reach out to Casey and silas about this and asked them if they planned on coming back to contribute to this we're not.

61
00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:12.570
Tracy Kuhrt: In and they did say that they were not planning on supporting borough going forward so as you can see PR has been created issue was created for us to discuss.

62
00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:33.300
Tracy Kuhrt: As of this morning, I saw that both Sean and Sean approved it and silas merged this pull request to archive borough but I did want to have this kind of formal discussion here informal decision that we will move hyper ledger borough to end of life stage um.

63
00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:39.270
Tracy Kuhrt: Any discussion that we should have before we move towards a vote.

64
00:10:41.730 --> 00:10:42.330
Tracy Kuhrt: Yet no.

65
00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:47.490
Danno Ferrin: I read in the real hot report that came in the last night when I couldn't sleep.

66
00:10:48.930 --> 00:10:59.280
Danno Ferrin: That they were one of their major points was they got rocks db working with borough So my question is, are you know what projects depend on bro.

67
00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:13.230
Danno Ferrin: And what are their plans going forward, I mean since, since all the maintainer is approved the archiving and shutting down the project I don't think there's any reason to not lose your well, but I think it's something we need to see how the other projects are going to deal with it.

68
00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:15.210
well.

69
00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:21.630
Jim Zhang: yeah thanks Tracy in the same vein, I vaguely remember.

70
00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:25.560
Jim Zhang: The borough team we're doing work.

71
00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:45.750
Jim Zhang: With the sawtooth lake team on the new transaction family with psychologies don't know if we checked with the salt lake team about this if there's any cross project dependencies.

72
00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:50.610
Tracy Kuhrt: Yes, it's true and I know.

73
00:11:51.600 --> 00:12:01.380
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): yeah I mean it's very much in the same line again because, so I think I reported the earlier this year that I attended a call from the team and.

74
00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:12.270
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): They were not aware of the time we had just moved borough to dormant status, and they were talking about how they were using bureau and I told them I said Oh, by the way, are you aware.

75
00:12:12.570 --> 00:12:25.950
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): And so, at least, you know they've been warned that there was a situation that they needed to worry about, but I agree with that Oh, we need to figure out and I guess gmm in the same facility is our dependencies like this.

76
00:12:26.850 --> 00:12:37.740
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): I imagine they need to be aware that this is now being archived I agree we shouldn't stop that, for that matter, because it is nobody to maintain it anyway.

77
00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:55.830
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): And, but practically speaking, it means that each one of you know of these projects has to make a decision to either take over, whatever the US from the borough project and make it follow their project or stop using it right.

78
00:12:57.240 --> 00:13:15.330
Tracy Kuhrt: yeah so I can I can come up on the sawtooth one because I do recall that when this initially happened and I think you brought that the 01 up in conversation on the TC call that we had reached out to start to let them also know that they were.

79
00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:34.950
Tracy Kuhrt: That we were that the project manager dornan state right and I can't find it currently in my chat, but I do recall them responding back and saying that's okay We actually had for what we need it into sawtooth and we've actually dedicated that anyway.

80
00:13:36.090 --> 00:13:42.360
Tracy Kuhrt: So that's what I recall from the side to side of the House, if I can find that at some point I will.

81
00:13:44.010 --> 00:13:47.760
Tracy Kuhrt: Put the link to that in in our chat but.

82
00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:51.120
Tracy Kuhrt: I as far as the real ha.

83
00:13:52.590 --> 00:13:56.790
Tracy Kuhrt: Do we have anybody on the real ha project that is here today.

84
00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:03.240
Ry Jones: So I talked.

85
00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:15.390
Ry Jones: That did exactly what I didn't want to do so, I will remove that, so I am on telegram with or haha and I had a conversation with Sarah and.

86
00:14:17.310 --> 00:14:19.350
Ry Jones: I don't remember in sobs name.

87
00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:24.150
Ry Jones: And this is what they had to say so.

88
00:14:25.230 --> 00:14:25.890
Ry Jones: they're aware.

89
00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:32.490
Tracy Kuhrt: Okay.

90
00:14:34.890 --> 00:14:37.410
Tracy Kuhrt: appreciate that update right.

91
00:14:40.350 --> 00:14:43.800
Tracy Kuhrt: Okay, any other discussion or concerns and at this point.

92
00:14:52.710 --> 00:14:56.280
Tracy Kuhrt: All right, do we have a motion to.

93
00:14:57.330 --> 00:14:59.700
Tracy Kuhrt: End of LIFE I religion bro.

94
00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:02.370
Peter Somogyvari: motion.

95
00:15:03.450 --> 00:15:03.780
Tracy Kuhrt: we're.

96
00:15:06.090 --> 00:15:07.590
Tracy Kuhrt: Here we have a second and then.

97
00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:09.360
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): I can see, and it.

98
00:15:11.250 --> 00:15:16.230
Nathan George: Just something quickly to add to the motion, we should probably thank the borough maintainer.

99
00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:29.310
Nathan George: For all their effort in the Community of a borough was a pretty significant project for us in terms of helping us stay close to the theory and community for quite a long time, so you know I don't know if that's something we can add to the resolution, but it seems appropriate.

100
00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:41.820
Tracy Kuhrt: yeah definitely agree and I think there was some really great collaboration, when I actually first doing the Linux foundation as a hyper ledger Community architect and.

101
00:15:42.270 --> 00:15:50.610
Tracy Kuhrt: With the the rural community and sawtooth and then further on with the fabric community and bringing kind of the vm to.

102
00:15:51.300 --> 00:16:05.700
Tracy Kuhrt: hyper ledger as a whole, and then to these projects individually, so I think there was a lot of good good stuff that came out of hyper ledger bro so appreciate you bringing that up anything alright, so I think we have a motion and a second.

103
00:16:07.710 --> 00:16:08.220
Tracy Kuhrt: Is there.

104
00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:16.740
Tracy Kuhrt: A I actually right normally let you run a vote can just register anybody opposed to nobody.

105
00:16:17.130 --> 00:16:17.910
Tracy Kuhrt: ever seen.

106
00:16:19.530 --> 00:16:22.650
Ry Jones: yeah and I will try to do it in the right or.

107
00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:30.840
Ry Jones: Does anyone opposed the motion before the technical steering committee to move borough to end of life status.

108
00:16:34.170 --> 00:16:37.470
Ry Jones: Does anyone abstain from voting on us.

109
00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:42.060
Ry Jones: All in favor say Aye.

110
00:16:44.010 --> 00:16:44.400
Tracy Kuhrt: Aye.

111
00:16:46.950 --> 00:16:50.850
Ry Jones: Okay i'm not gonna count, but by voice vote motion passes.

112
00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:52.830
Tracy Kuhrt: Alright, thanks right for that.

113
00:16:55.680 --> 00:17:09.360
Tracy Kuhrt: Alright, so the next item of discussion is an email that to us regarding the future state of hyper ledger explorer on, we need to I.

114
00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:17.730
Tracy Kuhrt: would like to hand the floor over to you to take the QC through that discussion, and what it is that you're asking.

115
00:17:18.450 --> 00:17:30.990
Chinoy, Vinita M.: I sure glad to do that, as you all know, the GCC has been the proponent and maintainer of hyper ledger explorer for the longest time and we.

116
00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:39.540
Chinoy, Vinita M.: were very, very active for a few years and then within our organization things move around, so we had fewer contributors from inside, but we did.

117
00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:51.510
Chinoy, Vinita M.: keep on having need OPS and try to increase our contributor levels, you know get more people involved and did quite a few of those up until last year.

118
00:17:52.020 --> 00:18:01.620
Chinoy, Vinita M.: With david's help we did a couple more where we showcase explorer and we start to the Community for more maintainer support and.

119
00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:08.340
Chinoy, Vinita M.: Also, as you all know that we had applied to get out of incubation several twice, I think.

120
00:18:08.970 --> 00:18:19.230
Chinoy, Vinita M.: In the past few years, the only thing that we missed out on was the number of contributors, we were That was the only missing factor everything else was good.

121
00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:29.640
Chinoy, Vinita M.: Definitely, a lot of folks are using explorer looking at the number of downloads on the docker hub, and the number of stars on the actual github.

122
00:18:30.210 --> 00:18:41.100
Chinoy, Vinita M.: Definitely there's there's a lot of folks were using it so definitely useful for folks but unfortunately the only two remaining mentors from etc and Fujitsu.

123
00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:55.950
Chinoy, Vinita M.: Are pulled with other responsibilities, so we are looking for other mainers to take on hyper ledger explore to the next stage so definitely do not want it to die, knowing that so many folks are using it.

124
00:18:57.030 --> 00:19:05.190
Chinoy, Vinita M.: So the question I raced to David boswell was like what can we do, and he put me in touch with IBM rod.

125
00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:18.210
Chinoy, Vinita M.: And it looks like there is a fabric console and hyper ledger lab so we had a few chats with him, and there are some synergies here that that takes export to one level above where you look at the.

126
00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:27.990
Chinoy, Vinita M.: Side where it's a read only repository you know you're looking at what's going on in the blockchain you slice and dice data using explorer.

127
00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:39.090
Chinoy, Vinita M.: At the same time, from the administrative side you could do things with explorer that fabric console offers so those two together would make a wonderful product that would definitely be.

128
00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:49.710
Chinoy, Vinita M.: welcomed by the Community, but after a few talks, it looks like that is not going to happen so from the IBM side, we were all ready to go with it.

129
00:19:50.670 --> 00:19:57.360
Chinoy, Vinita M.: So now we're back to square one, trying to find out how do we get moment pinner so several things come to my mind.

130
00:19:57.840 --> 00:20:06.150
Chinoy, Vinita M.: One is like, how do we appeal to the Community like we have done meetups we have asked for more contributors.

131
00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:15.390
Chinoy, Vinita M.: But i'm not sure the community knows we have looking actively for actual maintainer so if Community knows about it Maybe someone would come forward.

132
00:20:16.350 --> 00:20:27.150
Chinoy, Vinita M.: One of the folks I reached out to who had expressed interest is alone and he's from the hyper ledger chapter in India and he is talking to his.

133
00:20:28.230 --> 00:20:40.710
Chinoy, Vinita M.: I guess a management to find out if that is doable while i'm waiting on that I had also reached out via email and Peter approached me also and he had a wonderful suggestion that maybe.

134
00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:50.640
Chinoy, Vinita M.: That some useful parts could be absorbed in cactus cactus looks like is the next level of explorer which is blockchain agnostic, and that is.

135
00:20:51.120 --> 00:21:01.800
Chinoy, Vinita M.: That was also originally the aim of explorer expert, but we started out with fabric, and so I think something could be done there that's option number two.

136
00:21:03.270 --> 00:21:12.510
Chinoy, Vinita M.: So I leave it open to everybody to help help us decide what should we do next, as far as explorer.

137
00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:24.840
Chinoy, Vinita M.: I mean if if everybody agrees that the acid, it will can't find maintenance Africa, you know we've tried we'd reach out to the Community and.

138
00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:45.510
Chinoy, Vinita M.: Then it could possibly be absorbed in characters or you know it could just be archived and no more further development in explorer but definitely on the DC side we don't have any more folks that we could you know, lack of resources and so wanting us to pull out of it.

139
00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:48.780
Tracy Kuhrt: So yeah.

140
00:21:48.840 --> 00:22:01.650
Tracy Kuhrt: Thanks thanks for that, I think that was a really good explanation of the history of trying to get mean cleaners and kind of one of the projects that right now, unless you raised, your hand.

141
00:22:02.340 --> 00:22:05.310
Kamlesh Nagware: yeah so yeah so basically.

142
00:22:07.380 --> 00:22:10.170
Kamlesh Nagware: I run in my said, I think, as a division, they get.

143
00:22:11.310 --> 00:22:11.550
Kamlesh Nagware: So.

144
00:22:12.930 --> 00:22:14.580
Kamlesh Nagware: Good so disco discuss about the.

145
00:22:14.610 --> 00:22:29.610
Kamlesh Nagware: explorer future and kind of talk to the Community, even though the detailing corporation they're in our weekly call and ask them like if they can take interest or someone can take responsibility to become a mentor there is opportunity the.

146
00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:31.380
Kamlesh Nagware: iPad.

147
00:22:32.430 --> 00:22:36.600
Kamlesh Nagware: So then, when we are trying, as a Community level, and I think in India.

148
00:22:37.710 --> 00:22:50.730
Kamlesh Nagware: couple of organization keep joining our regular weekly meetings so when I think our room now to talk to anything I think we've planned some kind of meetups to collaborate within the operation console and.

149
00:22:53.250 --> 00:22:54.870
Kamlesh Nagware: Nothing happy to help for the perspective.

150
00:22:56.460 --> 00:23:04.380
Chinoy, Vinita M.: yeah, but that is i'm not sure if you're aware of the latest development in that respect is IBM has pulled out of that.

151
00:23:04.980 --> 00:23:06.450
Chinoy, Vinita M.: Okay yeah.

152
00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:12.540
Chinoy, Vinita M.: So there's no further talks of combining explorer and console.

153
00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:25.290
Chinoy, Vinita M.: Ideally, that would be a wonderful product so but, but the next step up, in my opinion, is cactus you know blockchain.

154
00:23:25.770 --> 00:23:34.440
Kamlesh Nagware: explorer what are you really the most most of us having more using the fabric, they are definitely using the exploring their their ecosystem.

155
00:23:35.370 --> 00:23:38.460
Chinoy, Vinita M.: Right, so I do notice widely used to bed.

156
00:23:39.510 --> 00:23:41.250
Chinoy, Vinita M.: What I do not know is.

157
00:23:42.390 --> 00:23:56.820
Chinoy, Vinita M.: Is the Community aware that there is a danger of this getting becoming end of life and Is there something that they should have been given a chance to do something about and that's the part I don't know how to go to the next step.

158
00:23:58.500 --> 00:24:00.180
Chinoy, Vinita M.: On that, and that also kind of.

159
00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:09.570
Chinoy, Vinita M.: You know alliance with the that policy that we were talking about earlier, is that the maintainer has not been active for the past six months.

160
00:24:10.530 --> 00:24:21.390
Chinoy, Vinita M.: You know, an activity, so it would be removed from right permission, so if you have no maintenance left and what is the next step, what do you, what do you do with that project like to do.

161
00:24:22.590 --> 00:24:29.730
Chinoy, Vinita M.: Is there a process in place like Okay, if the maintainer levels falls below three there is, we know we need to do something.

162
00:24:32.610 --> 00:24:32.850
Tracy Kuhrt: Now.

163
00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:43.260
Nathan George: um well and this brings up a good point is once you've group completely out of maintainer so it's hard to do a yard, sale and offer up code.

164
00:24:43.770 --> 00:24:50.730
Nathan George: My inner to help on board anyone new um and that will raise the other question about the options available.

165
00:24:51.780 --> 00:24:56.370
Nathan George: A lot of them are kind of speculative meaning it we're kind of offering it up to say, this could happen.

166
00:24:57.390 --> 00:25:09.060
Nathan George: Have all those options, is there any of them where there's a name associated with it, where someone said, this seems interesting to me or I might put the work in otherwise i'm just not sure if we can count on it actually happening.

167
00:25:11.940 --> 00:25:12.360
Tracy Kuhrt: I know.

168
00:25:13.530 --> 00:25:18.240
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): And just wanted to add, I mean my colleague data in here, who is on the development team.

169
00:25:19.020 --> 00:25:31.590
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): You know couldn't make it today, but he actually embraced me a little bit before the call and and I just wanted to add a little bit to what I said about the IBM team and the interest and.

170
00:25:32.130 --> 00:25:44.190
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): it's true that you know what was said is absolutely correct and what I would add, is the reason why IBM is kind of pulled out of this is actually merely resource issue reading and.

171
00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:53.010
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): They were interested in the you know the possibilities that this kind of convergence with the would bring.

172
00:25:53.430 --> 00:26:07.830
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): To the console but in the end it looked at the amount of code and they decided they couldn't just take responsibility for that code so maybe you know, I think, read the comments from.

173
00:26:09.210 --> 00:26:16.110
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): I think you know, Peter said, well, maybe we could take part of it, that would be useful to us, we don't want to take everything over.

174
00:26:16.410 --> 00:26:33.630
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): And maybe something like this would also be possible with the oppression console but you know, the bottom line is the reason primarily has been well this is more code than we can possibly take over and in the end they decided it wasn't ago.

175
00:26:33.870 --> 00:26:37.440
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): So that's probably the reason for the pullout.

176
00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:41.940
Chinoy, Vinita M.: And that's pretty much primarily the reason we're also lucky.

177
00:26:42.210 --> 00:26:43.020
I understand it.

178
00:26:47.340 --> 00:26:48.990
Tracy Kuhrt: All right, yeah and I I.

179
00:26:50.010 --> 00:27:00.570
Tracy Kuhrt: Peter I know you're on the call, I think you know important just to note for those who might not know I hyper ledger cactus is about interoperability.

180
00:27:00.990 --> 00:27:09.060
Tracy Kuhrt: between different blockchain platforms and explorer is about being able to look at your.

181
00:27:09.870 --> 00:27:17.040
Tracy Kuhrt: Block chain network to ensure that it's running smoothly and you know kind of the number of blocks and those sorts of things so.

182
00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:34.050
Tracy Kuhrt: I I mean when I hear like this comment about you know, putting it into practice, I wonder, exactly what that means, because I seem to be focused on two different things, and so, Peter I hate to put you on the spot, I know it's early there early for me as well.

183
00:27:35.190 --> 00:27:43.080
Tracy Kuhrt: But any any comments to add to your your email that you sent out to the best response to the data.

184
00:27:44.910 --> 00:27:45.960
Peter Somogyvari: No problem Tracy.

185
00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:50.190
Peter Somogyvari: I just I would just want to emphasize the part about.

186
00:27:51.210 --> 00:27:59.820
Peter Somogyvari: picking out the most useful components for the same reason word or new said, and he just said about the code is being large.

187
00:28:01.740 --> 00:28:02.070
Peter Somogyvari: and

188
00:28:03.660 --> 00:28:11.040
Peter Somogyvari: I would say the parts that we can reuse or start maintaining they would be the ones that are.

189
00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:16.560
Peter Somogyvari: The most important and then the ones that we already have.

190
00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:28.050
Peter Somogyvari: Something in our issue tracker for which is to have this functionality to observe, to be able to resolve the state of blocked fate.

191
00:28:29.550 --> 00:28:29.910
Peter Somogyvari: and

192
00:28:31.380 --> 00:28:47.700
Peter Somogyvari: The reason by I and a few other people in our one of our maintaining those meetings for that it would be a good idea to have something like this think actors was because of the theme of.

193
00:28:49.350 --> 00:29:03.060
Peter Somogyvari: I explore the characters both being types of projects that are Meta in the sense that they need to support all other types of ledger's for whatever they said they are do whatever it is that they do.

194
00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:05.730
Peter Somogyvari: And that was.

195
00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:08.070
Peter Somogyvari: that's how it started.

196
00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:09.480
Peter Somogyvari: and

197
00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:18.900
Peter Somogyvari: I know that's not strictly interrupt but at the same time it's something that's Jason just born out of this theme.

198
00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:23.040
Peter Somogyvari: And then I want to doubly underline that.

199
00:29:24.690 --> 00:29:36.150
Peter Somogyvari: We could not, we definitely could not take over the entire code base, it would have to be trimmed down to very specific ports, and then the other thing to underline is that.

200
00:29:37.470 --> 00:29:43.290
Peter Somogyvari: I could only make any sort of recommendations of what those costs would be if.

201
00:29:44.370 --> 00:29:55.830
Peter Somogyvari: We could talk to people who are running it in production and then we will make the pitch to them saying what if we pick these components out.

202
00:29:56.940 --> 00:30:08.760
Peter Somogyvari: And then we will start may take those as actors or would you then be then to come back and contribute, or maybe join us, maintaining the smaller part.

203
00:30:09.420 --> 00:30:27.270
Peter Somogyvari: So I would want to run this little survey, where the exist there I would test out the willingness of the existing Community use it to see if they are also willing to buy into my idea, the same way that I see.

204
00:30:28.350 --> 00:30:37.170
Peter Somogyvari: And there's a there's a version of events where suddenly a lot of people have their hands up saying oh yeah I looked at it earlier huge.

205
00:30:38.790 --> 00:30:54.330
Peter Somogyvari: deal with it, but now that you brought this idea forward and the small points that they actually use could be maintained by me now I put my hand up to actually be a meditator or at least a contributor.

206
00:30:55.740 --> 00:31:19.110
Peter Somogyvari: So my entire proposal hinges big time on the outcome of that survey if if we go out to the Community and it's still crickets even after us to set of components, then my answer would be formed by that as well, because if.

207
00:31:20.790 --> 00:31:30.420
Peter Somogyvari: It there's a lot of users, but then, even with the producer of components, no one is willing to stand up and help out with it, then.

208
00:31:31.500 --> 00:31:34.650
Peter Somogyvari: that's some of you think about for us as well.

209
00:31:36.780 --> 00:31:37.080
Peter Somogyvari: So.

210
00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:45.030
Chinoy, Vinita M.: That makes perfect sense to me I think yeah I like the idea of having a survey put out to the larger community.

211
00:31:45.750 --> 00:31:56.760
Chinoy, Vinita M.: You know, for explorer code to see you guys use it, you know how would you like to be you know just get a feel for maintainer is for this, you know first find out what is the interest.

212
00:31:57.450 --> 00:32:10.020
Chinoy, Vinita M.: In the, the problem is it's a utility right a tool is always harder to get that number of maintenance for, but we can we can still try, so I think we should we should definitely do that survey.

213
00:32:10.530 --> 00:32:27.930
Chinoy, Vinita M.: And at the end of that survey, you know it looks like there are few people and then that helps you determine Peter, if any, parts of it should be absorbed into cactus and if there aren't any, then the next logical step would be to just you know archive the project.

214
00:32:31.230 --> 00:32:34.470
Chinoy, Vinita M.: But definitely give the Community a chance, I like the idea to.

215
00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:50.850
Chinoy, Vinita M.: Because I feel like we do reach out to them, we are always you know doing meetups and you know, asking for contributors, but we've never really asked for maintainer such so not sure if folks know that we're looking for containers so.

216
00:32:51.930 --> 00:32:53.610
Chinoy, Vinita M.: That survey would definitely help.

217
00:32:56.040 --> 00:33:11.850
Tracy Kuhrt: So I have some commentary here, I guess, to add to this conversation, so what i've heard so far is that there are certain projects and or labs that might be interested in small pieces of hyper ledger explored to bring them in.

218
00:33:12.390 --> 00:33:24.570
Tracy Kuhrt: There has been a concerted effort in the past to get additional contributors to come into hyper ledger explore the contributors haven't shown up, which means, then you can turn them into me haters.

219
00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:26.310
Tracy Kuhrt: I.

220
00:33:27.330 --> 00:33:37.710
Tracy Kuhrt: I feel like if we continue down this path of serving and trying to get somebody interested we're going to be back here in six months to a year.

221
00:33:38.670 --> 00:33:49.260
Tracy Kuhrt: With no further progress having been made and it's it's kind of a concern right because I see that there are people who are trying to contribute to explore.

222
00:33:50.340 --> 00:33:53.700
Tracy Kuhrt: Where I actually redirected somebody yesterday from the.

223
00:33:53.700 --> 00:34:12.300
Tracy Kuhrt: fabric code contributors to the explorer channel in discord and I guess i'm just very concerned that you know we don't have people right now, who are willing to even review those PRS and do anything with the project so.

224
00:34:13.350 --> 00:34:26.550
Tracy Kuhrt: You know, as I look at this my my my thought is you we deprecate this at this point, which would give the notification to people that if they are interested, because they are said.

225
00:34:27.660 --> 00:34:34.710
Tracy Kuhrt: This would be the option, but of course deprecation means that you have somebody who's willing to support it for another six months.

226
00:34:35.790 --> 00:34:43.110
Tracy Kuhrt: which it sounds like we don't have anybody who's willing to support it for another six months, or do we just say you know this is.

227
00:34:44.160 --> 00:34:51.240
Tracy Kuhrt: Something that we think is we've done the best that we can, and it is now time to call it, and say let's talk about this.

228
00:34:56.070 --> 00:34:58.920
Tracy Kuhrt: Any any reactions to that from the.

229
00:35:01.260 --> 00:35:02.640
Chinoy, Vinita M.: So if if something.

230
00:35:02.940 --> 00:35:03.660
Chinoy, Vinita M.: is needed.

231
00:35:03.750 --> 00:35:12.210
Chinoy, Vinita M.: So if some support is needed for a few moments I can I can definitely you know, do something about it from our side to see.

232
00:35:13.020 --> 00:35:22.320
Chinoy, Vinita M.: That would be just be maintenance mode like it has been for the past like nine months, I think the last release that was pushed out was last August, and there have been no new really visits totally been.

233
00:35:23.610 --> 00:35:41.910
Chinoy, Vinita M.: You know, looking at the PRS and you know doing something about it so but for it to one person from 50 to a MAC person family, etc, I could get them to do you know, a be available, the next few months for support, if that is but that's that's about it.

234
00:35:42.510 --> 00:35:44.370
Chinoy, Vinita M.: yeah any new development.

235
00:35:44.970 --> 00:35:54.300
Tracy Kuhrt: Right understood understood, which I mean deprecate see is the intention to say that in six months we'll move this to an end of life steak.

236
00:35:54.840 --> 00:35:59.700
Tracy Kuhrt: But we are willing to maintain it for another six months in case people have anything that they want to.

237
00:36:00.150 --> 00:36:06.300
Tracy Kuhrt: come in, or participate in so that's that's kind of the the reason that I was thinking that.

238
00:36:07.830 --> 00:36:10.440
Tracy Kuhrt: it's good to know i've been here, thank you and Peter.

239
00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:15.360
Peter Somogyvari: The other thing we could do is.

240
00:36:16.770 --> 00:36:28.140
Peter Somogyvari: And the fly fit now and the survey, at the same time, I think it's a it's a it might actually help the survey that's the point I was going to make earlier.

241
00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:41.850
Peter Somogyvari: Which is that you know we say that this is not an applied, but we also put it right there that huge letters that there's a survey very or looking to.

242
00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:54.360
Peter Somogyvari: resurrect parts of it and that if you're serious about helping out the dead and contact us, and that would give it eight because.

243
00:36:55.800 --> 00:37:02.880
Peter Somogyvari: You know if if you ask people a year ago, please can contribute a lot of them as far as well.

244
00:37:03.810 --> 00:37:15.690
Peter Somogyvari: i'm using it and it's kind of important but i'll just let someone else contribute because i'm busy, and then everyone's thinking that you know there's a name for that problem they will fix that someone else will do them.

245
00:37:17.820 --> 00:37:35.310
Peter Somogyvari: So, but that if its end of life, and you are actually using the edge important to you, for whatever reason, to the point that you're willing to help you're going to think about it much more seriously, now that you know the messages out there saying this is done.

246
00:37:36.630 --> 00:37:47.250
Peter Somogyvari: So i'm not saying that you should definitely do this i'm just saying in my opinion, this also credible option to think about where we just.

247
00:37:47.820 --> 00:37:59.700
Peter Somogyvari: Do the end of life but literally on the same part of the Read me the same paragraph we say, please leave a comment and this issue that we open which survey where.

248
00:38:00.270 --> 00:38:10.230
Peter Somogyvari: You could explain what you're using it for How important is it to you and would you be the cumulative fit that support out of it somewhere else and.

249
00:38:11.460 --> 00:38:18.390
Peter Somogyvari: Which ports those would be, which is very valuable data for us in the future if anything happens.

250
00:38:20.910 --> 00:38:21.120
Right.

251
00:38:22.380 --> 00:38:22.740
or no.

252
00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:34.500
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): So I don't know if I would go as far as I mean a survey per se, but I think Peter is touching a an interesting point, which is when we archive projects.

253
00:38:34.890 --> 00:38:42.060
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): It would be good if there was a way we could communicate and maybe this is like in the description I don't know what we have now.

254
00:38:42.390 --> 00:38:57.330
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): But there should be something that says hey if you know this project was archived, but if you have an interest, you know in in contributing resurrecting this project feel free to contact the tasc or something along those lines.

255
00:38:57.750 --> 00:39:07.290
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): So that we can communicate to people that that's always a possibility, because if i'm an external Party I may not even think that this is a possibility.

256
00:39:07.650 --> 00:39:13.290
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): which I think it is, I mean tell me if i'm wrong, but I don't think anybody would be a positive, you know if.

257
00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:29.400
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): The example of explore if we decide okay sorry there was just no resources into this we move it to the side is it six months a year from now, somebody shows up and say hey i'm really interested in this, I will take it over I don't think we would say no.

258
00:39:31.890 --> 00:39:38.610
Tracy Kuhrt: yeah completely agree, I think you know, this could be something that we do as we move these to.

259
00:39:39.660 --> 00:39:55.200
Tracy Kuhrt: archive is also add a note at the top of the Ruby like that basically says this project has been archived if you're interested in resurrecting this please contact the hyper ledger PC at whatever QC.

260
00:39:57.600 --> 00:39:59.190
Tracy Kuhrt: Network never it is right.

261
00:40:00.270 --> 00:40:06.270
Tracy Kuhrt: yeah exactly I think I think that makes a lot of sense right same is like we could do that, right now, with the the borough.

262
00:40:07.140 --> 00:40:20.610
Tracy Kuhrt: Project, although it has been Okay, do you think already so it might be a bit difficult to make that change i'm not sure how difficult it is rate changes on so that's Okay, but yeah I do, I do think having some sort of notice is useful.

263
00:40:26.550 --> 00:40:29.190
Tracy Kuhrt: All right, any other comments um.

264
00:40:29.370 --> 00:40:32.250
Ry Jones: it's just mechanical so if.

265
00:40:33.990 --> 00:40:39.690
Ry Jones: If someone has texted they want to add the borough remi or this readme.

266
00:40:40.860 --> 00:40:46.380
Ry Jones: You know I can archive it slip in the change every archive it it's not that big of a deal.

267
00:40:48.330 --> 00:41:00.750
Tracy Kuhrt: Okay, they try and I am happy to provide some some text, and then we can get that into the borough one maybe any other ones that we've done since.

268
00:41:01.950 --> 00:41:03.060
Tracy Kuhrt: There recently.

269
00:41:05.190 --> 00:41:20.970
Tracy Kuhrt: Right you brought up this is security stuff on blockchain explorer have some things that are critical one high priority that have been created, as far as issues was their commentary you wanted to add around that.

270
00:41:21.960 --> 00:41:26.670
Ry Jones: Right, the commentary is I based on the high number of.

271
00:41:28.050 --> 00:41:30.750
Ry Jones: That there are 25 critical or high severity.

272
00:41:32.010 --> 00:41:37.830
Ry Jones: Issues I don't think anyone should be using it as is if you're rolling out.

273
00:41:39.120 --> 00:41:40.380
Ry Jones: explorer somewhere.

274
00:41:41.610 --> 00:41:43.650
Ry Jones: There are a lot of issues in the code.

275
00:41:44.910 --> 00:41:53.220
Ry Jones: The other thing I wanted to point out is we already have pull requests that have been open since September of 2021.

276
00:41:56.070 --> 00:41:56.940
Ry Jones: So it's.

277
00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:02.730
Ry Jones: It you know I think the next step is end of life.

278
00:42:03.930 --> 00:42:16.560
Ry Jones: And that will just acknowledge the situation that we're in which is there a bunch of security problems, no one is merging essentially pull requests are not being merged.

279
00:42:18.300 --> 00:42:25.590
Ry Jones: And then we if someone shows up and wants to take it over then we applaud them and make it happen.

280
00:42:27.930 --> 00:42:31.830
Ry Jones: So I just you know, in its current state, with all the security alerts I.

281
00:42:32.970 --> 00:42:39.540
Ry Jones: I think another whatever three to six months of not enough life is is not a good signal to send.

282
00:42:45.540 --> 00:42:46.230
Ry Jones: All right, any.

283
00:42:47.340 --> 00:42:49.350
Tracy Kuhrt: Other thoughts or comments.

284
00:42:56.760 --> 00:43:03.960
Tracy Kuhrt: So if you need a preference or thoughts on the two kind of suggestions that have been out there around.

285
00:43:05.880 --> 00:43:09.270
Tracy Kuhrt: deprecate it end of life, based on the conversation waiting for.

286
00:43:14.370 --> 00:43:21.630
Chinoy, Vinita M.: Either one is fine, whatever the steering committee seems is the next logical step is fine with me.

287
00:43:25.950 --> 00:43:26.220
Tracy Kuhrt: Right.

288
00:43:30.210 --> 00:43:30.960
Tracy Kuhrt: So i've heard.

289
00:43:32.730 --> 00:43:35.700
Tracy Kuhrt: A device from a few folks I think.

290
00:43:37.170 --> 00:43:41.670
Tracy Kuhrt: I haven't heard from everybody that was there, do we have any sort of consensus this point.

291
00:43:56.460 --> 00:43:56.880
Ry Jones: well.

292
00:43:58.230 --> 00:44:04.890
Ry Jones: If you put emotion before the tlc to end of life and let people vote against it.

293
00:44:06.600 --> 00:44:07.350
Ry Jones: Then we know.

294
00:44:09.540 --> 00:44:10.110
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): And I asked.

295
00:44:11.910 --> 00:44:12.720
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): Every keys.

296
00:44:12.810 --> 00:44:13.860
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): Are these public.

297
00:44:19.290 --> 00:44:20.910
Ry Jones: sort of but no.

298
00:44:22.770 --> 00:44:23.190
Ry Jones: They.

299
00:44:24.210 --> 00:44:29.970
Ry Jones: Their public the tasc Members are in a special permission group so you have the ability to see those.

300
00:44:32.130 --> 00:44:34.440
Ry Jones: They are private to the maintainer.

301
00:44:35.910 --> 00:44:38.790
Ry Jones: The PR is that get created are.

302
00:44:39.900 --> 00:44:41.700
Ry Jones: You know, take a look here.

303
00:44:43.110 --> 00:44:44.850
Ry Jones: So, like these be ours.

304
00:44:47.340 --> 00:44:49.170
Ry Jones: just say that it has a vulnerability.

305
00:44:50.610 --> 00:44:51.750
Ry Jones: But they all say what it is.

306
00:44:53.130 --> 00:45:06.720
Ry Jones: But there there's nothing stopping anyone if you fork this to your account and turn on dependable, you will see all this so, is it public not directly on the on this page but.

307
00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:08.580
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): So.

308
00:45:09.060 --> 00:45:10.230
Ry Jones: You discovered very easily.

309
00:45:11.790 --> 00:45:16.110
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): These are easy to fix right typically dependable just say okay marriage.

310
00:45:18.270 --> 00:45:19.950
Ry Jones: Sure, but this is.

311
00:45:21.750 --> 00:45:22.830
Ry Jones: Like perhaps.

312
00:45:24.750 --> 00:45:30.930
Ry Jones: What seven of these and they're 42 security issues, so, for whatever reason.

313
00:45:33.480 --> 00:45:38.520
Ry Jones: like these, ones that are these two that are on on high it couldn't generate the.

314
00:45:39.750 --> 00:45:40.050
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): Like.

315
00:45:40.590 --> 00:45:41.370
Ry Jones: If you.

316
00:45:42.750 --> 00:45:47.760
Ry Jones: click here, it says cannot update to a non mobile version because of this dependency conflict.

317
00:45:48.450 --> 00:45:51.510
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): Okay, so there's no issues that require some work.

318
00:45:51.810 --> 00:46:08.130
Ry Jones: yeah they're the ones that it can't auto generate dude do generally need you know some to put some small dependency updated and then you need to retest everything to make sure that things don't work so it's not quite as mechanical.

319
00:46:08.610 --> 00:46:15.750
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): And so, let me ask the need, I mean when you said you could you could possibly maintain for another six months but.

320
00:46:15.750 --> 00:46:16.470
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): without doing.

321
00:46:16.500 --> 00:46:20.610
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): Further development does that include addressing these kind of issues or no.

322
00:46:20.670 --> 00:46:23.040
Chinoy, Vinita M.: Yes, yeah we take care of that.

323
00:46:24.630 --> 00:46:38.370
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): Because you know that seems like something that should be pretty high on the list if we wanted to, otherwise we they I, in my opinion, if we don't do at least this kind of stuff there is no other choice than putting aside.

324
00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:49.710
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): With the big labels thing quite child and maybe we don't get into the details, but we would have to say, you know, there are known issues don't use this in production or something.

325
00:46:55.920 --> 00:46:57.900
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): Of you want to archive anyway, but.

326
00:46:58.950 --> 00:47:07.380
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): It would just make it more obvious that has to be this I was trying to get up, I think, maybe we should still either you know.

327
00:47:08.820 --> 00:47:09.690
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): A warning.

328
00:47:12.210 --> 00:47:17.970
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): So that once it's archived people don't see it, but I can still use it if we know there are issues.

329
00:47:22.650 --> 00:47:23.850
Ry Jones: So this is the warning.

330
00:47:25.500 --> 00:47:27.060
Ry Jones: At the top of hyper ledger composer.

331
00:47:28.650 --> 00:47:29.670
Ry Jones: That Simon put in.

332
00:47:31.860 --> 00:47:35.100
Ry Jones: So I think something along.

333
00:47:35.610 --> 00:47:37.980
Ry Jones: These lines would be appropriate.

334
00:47:48.810 --> 00:47:49.170
Tracy Kuhrt: Okay.

335
00:47:50.610 --> 00:47:51.420
Tracy Kuhrt: So.

336
00:47:52.920 --> 00:47:57.300
Tracy Kuhrt: back to the question of do we have any sort of.

337
00:47:58.650 --> 00:48:04.350
Tracy Kuhrt: motion that anybody would like to make on this, as far as what the future direction should be.

338
00:48:09.660 --> 00:48:16.650
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): Even that is very easy as writing this reminded us mechanically it's very simple right archiving a repo.

339
00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:32.280
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): or vice versa, I think we should move it to an offline for archival and and and kind of see if anybody, you know reacts to it because I agree with what Peter was saying earlier people tend to take the easy way out right.

340
00:48:32.520 --> 00:48:33.870
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): Maybe they do use it.

341
00:48:34.080 --> 00:48:41.610
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): Maybe they want to keep it but they're like well as long as somebody else does the work for me i'm just going to keep it a low profile.

342
00:48:42.090 --> 00:48:51.480
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): In a way, you know you we've been trying to get people to step in they haven't if we just you know it will force the issue.

343
00:48:52.020 --> 00:49:02.760
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): it's like well, either now you step up and you, you know we can earn archive it and you can take over, or it is archive don't use it anymore or use it at your own peril.

344
00:49:04.140 --> 00:49:05.400
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): So i'm in favor.

345
00:49:13.230 --> 00:49:19.230
Tracy Kuhrt: So let's let's see if we can then have a vote to end of life hyper ledger for today.

346
00:49:27.120 --> 00:49:35.940
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): Does anyone with the with the proper text to say you know if people are interested to take it over, we can definitely reopen it.

347
00:49:36.750 --> 00:49:38.730
Tracy Kuhrt: I agree, I agree on your.

348
00:49:41.190 --> 00:49:46.590
Peter Somogyvari: Oh, I was just going to say the same thing going on just said just wanted to make sure to that is part of emotion.

349
00:49:49.050 --> 00:49:51.210
Tracy Kuhrt: Okay, so the.

350
00:49:52.830 --> 00:50:07.080
Tracy Kuhrt: Can I get a motion to end of life hyper ledger explore with text in the Read me about the ability to archive if people are interested in taking on mentorship.

351
00:50:09.780 --> 00:50:10.050
Tracy Kuhrt: Thanks.

352
00:50:12.690 --> 00:50:13.380
Tracy Kuhrt: Have a second.

353
00:50:15.900 --> 00:50:17.910
Tracy Kuhrt: Here instead oh.

354
00:50:19.920 --> 00:50:25.710
Tracy Kuhrt: Alright, so right, I think the roll call would be good, given that we didn't hear from everybody.

355
00:50:27.030 --> 00:50:27.420
Ry Jones: Okay.

356
00:50:30.600 --> 00:50:34.050
Ry Jones: on abortion before the tlc Jim, how do you vote.

357
00:50:36.420 --> 00:50:37.050
Jim Zhang: Yes.

358
00:50:41.040 --> 00:50:41.580
Kamlesh Nagware: Yes.

359

00:50:50.430 --> 00:50:50.760
Ry Jones: Troy.

365
00:50:51.510 --> 00:50:53.100
Ry Jones: Yes or no.

366
00:50:53.790 --> 00:50:54.300
Yes.

367
00:50:57.630 --> 00:50:58.170
Artem Barger: Yes.

368
00:50:59.040 --> 00:51:00.720
Bobbi Muscara: Bobby yes.

369
