WEBVTT

1
00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:13.649
Tracy Kuhrt: Oh, welcome everyone to the October thirteenth. Technical Oversight Committee call

2
00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:23.269
Tracy Kuhrt: uh, as you are all aware, a couple of things that we must divide by the first is the antitrust policy. Notice that it's currently displayed on screen,

3
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.890
Tracy Kuhrt: and the second is our code of conduct. Um,

4
00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.010
Tracy Kuhrt: which is like specifically in the agenda.

5
00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:48.919
Tracy Kuhrt: So as far as announcements go today. Uh, we have the standard announcement, The Hyper Ledger, that we think develop our newsletter goes out each Friday, if you have anything that you'd like to be included in that. So you leave a comment on the Wiki page, since link in the agenda

6
00:00:49.300 --> 00:01:05.149
Tracy Kuhrt: uh the second announcement that we may have already noticed some changes happening. But, uh, the charter changes have been approved. Uh, and we are now the Technical Oversight committee, not the technical starting thing. So uh,

7
00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:13.770
Tracy Kuhrt: I have the charter linked here in the agenda. If you want to see the specific changes uh that were included. There were a few other changes besides that.

8
00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.009
Tracy Kuhrt: Um.

9
00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.440
Tracy Kuhrt: Besides that, we know that happened

10
00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.199
Tracy Kuhrt: any other announcements that anybody has.

11
00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:32.539
Tracy Kuhrt: Okay,

12
00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:52.079
Tracy Kuhrt: uh. So if there's no other announcements. Uh, we do have uh the outstanding report. I did send a reminder on the discord Channel um about a week ago, and we're still waiting on that. I also included links to the

13
00:01:52.090 --> 00:02:09.440
Tracy Kuhrt: Uh reports that had basically Hadn't had a a whole lot of reviews that had happened. I did notice that, but most of these have been almost completely reviewed by everybody. But if you still are outstanding, please do have a look at those particular reports.

14
00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:28.949
Tracy Kuhrt: Um! The only one that I saw that had any sort of question was a question that I had on the Firefly one related to the organizational diversity of the maintainers. Um! I have not yet seen an answer to that, so I don't know that we have anybody here from Firefly today.

15
00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:46.309
Tracy Kuhrt: I don't see anybody on the participant list from Firefly, so we'll we'll wait to get get that answered on the report. But Tracy, I thought the report actually says that it's uh all the Maintainer is off from Kaleido.

16
00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:51.300
Tracy Kuhrt: Did you say that? Um. I wonder if that changed after that?

17
00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:02.439
Tracy Kuhrt: Uh, okay, yes, it does say that. Uh. So I guess the question is answered. Um,

18
00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:12.809
Tracy Kuhrt: we will uh assume that I didn't miss it, or maybe I did visit, and uh either way it's there now, so. Thanks for that.

19
00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:26.490
Arnaud J Le Hors ("Arno"): No, but I saw your question, and then I thought, Oh, but I think it's answered, and I had the same thought. Maybe they changed. It didn't say in response to your comment. But so it's there, anyway.

20
00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:35.820
Tracy Kuhrt: Any other questions that anybody has

21
00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:38.600
Tracy Kuhrt: on the reports,

22
00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:45.499
Tracy Kuhrt: and then i'm sorry you come off mute, but I we couldn't hear you if you were speaking.

23
00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:47.720
Danno Ferrin: Um! Can you hear me now?

24
00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:49.640
Tracy Kuhrt: Now? You're very faint.

25
00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:55.149
Danno Ferrin: I saw Jim's day here at the pond, and I think he said he had a flight.

26
00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.620
Danno Ferrin: So I think that's why Firefly is not on the call.

27
00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:02.730
Tracy Kuhrt: Okay, yeah. I did see Jim's uh regret since

28
00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:06.230
Tracy Kuhrt: uh, somewhere. I think it may have been discord. So thanks for that man.

29
00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:10.820
Tracy Kuhrt: Okay, Any other questions on the the reports.

30
00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:31.809
Tracy Kuhrt: Okay. Uh. So if there's no other questions on the report, we do have the fabric in the cactus reports that are doing today. Uh. So we'll look forward to seeing those show up, and uh, all the including those on the

31
00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:34.030
Tracy Kuhrt: on the agenda for next week.

32
00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:44.290
Tracy Kuhrt: So the only thing that I have for topics today is the Toc election, for that is upcoming. Um,

33
00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:50.870
Tracy Kuhrt: before we before we get there. Are there any other topics that anybody would like to add to the Agenda.

34
00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:17.469
Tracy Kuhrt: Okay. So let's take a look at the the poc election for two thousand and twenty-two uh I did copy in the the chartered here uh into this document uh the composition. Uh, as we probably recall, though there'll be six uh

35
00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:34.920
Tracy Kuhrt: individuals that will be elected by the Maintainer of the projects, and then five appointees that will be appointed by the governing board uh to make up the eleven toc numbers for next uh for the next term.

36
00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:36.900
Tracy Kuhrt: Uh. So

37
00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:56.200
Tracy Kuhrt: that's a directly from the Charter as it stands today. Um! So I have put together this document along with the help of Brian, me and uh, just exactly what this process and timeline is going to look like. So if we look at the nomination process and timeline

38
00:05:56.210 --> 00:06:14.940
Tracy Kuhrt: uh i'm hoping that we can start this process next week uh, and have people nominate themselves uh through the end of October uh to run for the the poc. I'm. Hoping this timeline works is kind of quick turnaround, but I i'm hoping we can merit that

39
00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:26.879
Tracy Kuhrt: um as far as what it what is required. We need to gather the github. Id for the active Maintainer and the active contributors. I have done some changes to our

40
00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:45.959
Tracy Kuhrt: what was once called our voters uh check site. It's now an eligibility check site that will allow you to see if you're eligible to run, or and or eligible to vote uh in the upcoming poc election. Uh, we have some standard templates that are

41
00:06:45.970 --> 00:07:04.179
Tracy Kuhrt: um that need to be updated to it like the twenty twenty-two dates, and uh we need to send out communication to people to let them know that the poc nomination is happening. Um! And then uh reminder sort of communication to ensure that people

42
00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:23.289
Tracy Kuhrt: are um aware that the timeline is ending uh, and then the nominations would close, and the day Pacific um to get the list of nominees. So any questions on her this nomination process uh or any concerns with what you see.

43
00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:24.309
Tracy Kuhrt: We're written here.

44
00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:36.669
Arnaud J Le Hors ("Arno"): So I have a question. That second thing there, I thought I thought part of the plan was to avoid having to do this, so i'm a bit surprised that it's there

45
00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:40.240
Arnaud J Le Hors ("Arno"): building this list of active contributors.

46
00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:48.090
Tracy Kuhrt: Yeah. So if we go back up to the charter. Um! We'll see that the

47
00:07:49.290 --> 00:08:07.889
Tracy Kuhrt: uh I think it's for dot a dot. I It says that individuals who are active within within the scope of the Hyper Ledger Foundation, and who have nominated themselves for the Tsd. Um. So I guess the the challenge was, How do we determine who's active?

48
00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:13.550
Tracy Kuhrt: And uh, the that was that the active people are the people who have contributed.

49
00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:26.240
Tracy Kuhrt: But I agree. I don't know. I think, that's always been a a concern. But uh, yeah, we do still need to figure out if people who nominate themselves should be uh dominating themselves.

50
00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:38.509
Arnaud J Le Hors ("Arno"): So wait. Let me make sure. I understand this article for the active contributor is to do what it's those who are eligible to run for the talk. Right?

51
00:08:38.559 --> 00:08:49.320
Tracy Kuhrt: Yeah. So for the A to I Uh. It says that individuals who are active within the scope of the hyper lighter foundation, and who have nominated themselves to the Tsc. Right?

52
00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:52.729
Arnaud J Le Hors ("Arno"): So I think this is the what we need to be clear. It's like

53
00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:58.780
Arnaud J Le Hors ("Arno"): active contributors can run and maintainers can vote.

54
00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:04.060
Arnaud J Le Hors ("Arno"): But so I Yeah,

55
00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:22.129
Arnaud J Le Hors ("Arno"): I would. I was wondering. I mean, if you know, this stuff should really go through the process of building this list of active contributor, which may be very time consuming as opposed to just check that the people get dominated or qualified,

56
00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:41.980
Arnaud J Le Hors ("Arno"): and it may sound like it's the same. But I don't think it is the same, because you Don't need to, you know. Go out of your way to figure out the whole list of possible active contributors rather than just checking specific individuals whether they are they qualify or not?

57
00:09:41.990 --> 00:10:01.560
Arnaud J Le Hors ("Arno"): But it's a detail in implementation. But you know again, I I thought one of the motivations of the change was to try to simplify the process, and i'm afraid that this is the worst part that was from the previous process. If we carry it over,

58
00:10:01.570 --> 00:10:04.809
Arnaud J Le Hors ("Arno"): we we've kind of missed the both somewhere there.

59
00:10:04.990 --> 00:10:08.830
Arnaud J Le Hors ("Arno"): But I see Daniel as his end up, so i'll shut up,

60
00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:19.139
Danno Ferrin: so I kind of agree that um we shouldn't get it contributors. If it would be gathered to maintain it. It would be a fairly easy thing for the Maintainer list

61
00:10:19.270 --> 00:10:24.039
Danno Ferrin: any project, but I think we could flip it kind of our seeing. If you nominate yourself,

62
00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:28.709
Danno Ferrin: you serve on the

63
00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:34.459
Danno Ferrin: a question There, please describe your contribution to the Hyper Ledger, or

64
00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:38.560
Danno Ferrin: provide the proof as part of their self-

65
00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:43.290
Tracy Kuhrt: yeah

66
00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:54.370
Hyperledger Community: to a hypothetical community. Um, can I share my screen?

67
00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:55.850
Sean Bohan (Hyperledger): Sure.

68
00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:09.170
Hyperledger Community: So I have this uh day zero where I've been running scripts that uh download the github uh

69
00:11:09.770 --> 00:11:13.329
Hyperledger Community: event logs every day back to two thousand and sixteen,

70
00:11:13.450 --> 00:11:16.389
Hyperledger Community: and then I have scripts in here that are running to

71
00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:18.220
Hyperledger Community: uh extract

72
00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:22.189
Hyperledger Community: uh the people that have done anything.

73
00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:24.980
Hyperledger Community: Um! So

74
00:11:25.150 --> 00:11:28.360
Hyperledger Community: that's fairly already automated.

75
00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:33.980
Hyperledger Community: I agree with the rewarding that was proposed, you know. Uh, I also have

76
00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:40.399
Hyperledger Community: this uh maintainer list uh that gathers all the Maintainer files

77
00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:47.139
Hyperledger Community: well today, and then I have a list of the maintainers from those

78
00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:53.169
Hyperledger Community: um. So those lists already exist, the list of maintainers already exist.

79
00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:54.740
Hyperledger Community: Um.

80
00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:58.730
Hyperledger Community: And I I also have a uh,

81
00:11:59.110 --> 00:12:00.880
Hyperledger Community: yeah. I have

82
00:12:01.090 --> 00:12:05.520
Hyperledger Community: sixty something open bugs against Repos that Don't have a maintainer's file.

83
00:12:06.230 --> 00:12:09.070
Hyperledger Community: So it's uh, you know

84
00:12:10.370 --> 00:12:18.250
Hyperledger Community: the For the most part it's completely automated. Um, But I would like that warning change to to uh

85
00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:19.519
Hyperledger Community: make that happen.

86
00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:34.229
Tracy Kuhrt: Okay. So uh, the recommendation is that in the nominee email we change it to say, Um, please include your contributions to

87
00:12:35.090 --> 00:12:37.739
Tracy Kuhrt: the Hyper Ledger foundation in the past year.

88
00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:55.830
Arnaud J Le Hors ("Arno"): Yeah, maybe we probably can hint that maybe it's simply providing your github uh, you know, Id with the

89
00:12:55.970 --> 00:12:58.820
Arnaud J Le Hors ("Arno"): activity is good enough

90
00:12:59.650 --> 00:13:06.010
Arnaud J Le Hors ("Arno"): for most people. I think that will do it, and then the edge cases in a it may require a bit more. But

91
00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:14.229
Hyperledger Community: so David and I uh discuss this earlier. Um

92
00:13:14.850 --> 00:13:26.199
Hyperledger Community: The previous election we had, I think, uh twenty two nominations. We had maybe another half dozen people that requested uh to run that had no activity.

93
00:13:26.570 --> 00:13:30.270
Hyperledger Community: Um, so it's fairly easy to

94
00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:38.850
Hyperledger Community: to get that. What I don't want to do is because a contributor is defined as people who do stuff in the Wiki and and stuff like that.

95
00:13:39.410 --> 00:13:44.269
Hyperledger Community: Um, it isn't like it was before where we had to check a million emails.

96
00:13:44.290 --> 00:13:45.410
Hyperledger Community: Um:

97
00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:49.380
Hyperledger Community: So yeah, let's

98
00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:55.050
Hyperledger Community: change that Toc nominee wording. And uh,

99
00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:58.559
Hyperledger Community: I I think that's going to be much, much easier.

100
00:13:59.470 --> 00:14:08.489
Tracy Kuhrt: Okay, I just uh update it uh this page. Eventually I don't come through to you. But if you wouldn't mind refreshing um

101
00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:28.450
Tracy Kuhrt: yeah, scroll down uh. So I added the contributions that I have had to the Hyper ledger foundation. It kind of goes off the page here on the email itself. Um, but it basically says, uh, the yeah, the contribution I don't know why it's not um showing quite right. But anyway,

102
00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:46.710
Tracy Kuhrt: uh contributions that I've had to The hybrid foundation in the past year is dot dot dot uh let them fill it in right. Um. So this is, I mean, we don't want to have people go through a whole archaeological uh task, either. They only need one thing that qualifies right.

103
00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:52.620
Tracy Kuhrt: Okay, Do we want to include a checklist? I mean

104
00:14:52.630 --> 00:15:09.090
Arnaud J Le Hors ("Arno"): that's why i'm trying to. I I don't want to mislead people into saying they they need to go back for the whole year and look at all the things they've done and compile all of this. This is not what we're asking for either. So we need to be careful the way we phrase the question.

105
00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:25.110
Arnaud J Le Hors ("Arno"): They just need to provide some evidence that they qualify. And it could just be, you know it is my github idea, and you can go look at the All the Pr. And see A in. You know that I've done something along those lines, and

106
00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:41.380
Arnaud J Le Hors ("Arno"): if I I mean, I suspect that there are many cases where we already know the answer, and it's just. They may be cases where rice is. I've never heard of that person. Who are they? What are they doing? And they may look a bit beyond that. But

107
00:15:42.290 --> 00:15:43.350
Arnaud J Le Hors ("Arno"): so

108
00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:51.349
Hyperledger Community: um so, for the the script emits

109
00:15:51.430 --> 00:15:52.760
Hyperledger Community: this stuff,

110
00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:57.930
Hyperledger Community: and this this is for the Maintainer is not the the people who do things.

111
00:15:58.140 --> 00:16:02.289
Hyperledger Community: But I, you know, on a per repo basis. I can look in here and see

112
00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:04.810
Hyperledger Community: what did somebody do?

113
00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:08.860
Hyperledger Community: So the the check website is going to look at

114
00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:12.170
Hyperledger Community: at this this list of people that have done something

115
00:16:12.750 --> 00:16:20.159
Hyperledger Community: uh I haven't written the script yet to automatically update this to um.

116
00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:23.049
Hyperledger Community: So when I when I did this by hand.

117
00:16:23.170 --> 00:16:24.260
Hyperledger Community: Um!

118
00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:26.410
Hyperledger Community: The uh!

119
00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:35.669
Hyperledger Community: The number of people that had done a qualifying activity this year to to run were around one thousand nine hundred

120
00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:37.730
Hyperledger Community: um.

121
00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:41.200
Hyperledger Community: So I think that's going to get almost everybody

122
00:16:41.250 --> 00:16:44.590
Hyperledger Community: uh. So what I will do

123
00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:46.830
Hyperledger Community: soon

124
00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.609
Hyperledger Community: is get that list into the voter website

125
00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:53.140
Hyperledger Community: uh so people can check.

126
00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:58.249
Hyperledger Community: I I said, voter the the

127
00:16:58.570 --> 00:17:00.709
Hyperledger Community: uh check my status website,

128
00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:06.879
Hyperledger Community: and that'll be something that gets updated once a day by get of actions or whatever.

129
00:17:07.349 --> 00:17:10.799
Hyperledger Community: And then it would be the further edge case would be,

130
00:17:11.460 --> 00:17:15.240
Hyperledger Community: you know, if they don't have a github Id they haven't done anything

131
00:17:15.930 --> 00:17:21.110
Hyperledger Community: that's where it's going to be. We'll have to go look in the wiki, or something of that nature.

132
00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:30.740
Tracy Kuhrt: Um,

133
00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:37.389
Tracy Kuhrt: okay, uh. So the other thing here uh i'm making one last change

134
00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:43.920
Tracy Kuhrt: uh to this page. But uh,

135
00:17:43.990 --> 00:18:00.790
Tracy Kuhrt: if you wouldn't mind refreshing again, Shawn Sorry about that. Um. So I included kind of the please check all that. Apply um of what it is that you've done uh. That would qualify you to run for the the Tfc. Election. Um, it's.

136
00:18:00.930 --> 00:18:05.939
Tracy Kuhrt: I don't know if it's a complete list, but I did it with the other, and they please provide details. So

137
00:18:06.340 --> 00:18:16.169
Tracy Kuhrt: maybe this will address the concerns I know of not having to say there's a hundred thousand minutes that I've done.

138
00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:17.450
Arnaud J Le Hors ("Arno"): No,

139
00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:31.340
Tracy Kuhrt: okay. Any other comments in on the nomination process or the timeline here.

140
00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:48.660
Tracy Kuhrt: Okay, uh. So then for the election process uh the voting period for the six uh

141
00:18:48.750 --> 00:18:54.919
Tracy Kuhrt: Ts Poc. Members are uh from November first, through November thirtieth

142
00:18:55.130 --> 00:19:13.520
Tracy Kuhrt: um. So we will obviously announce the slave candidates. We're going to use a new new tool this year uh called Helios voting uh It's a tool that has you been used by other Linux foundation projects. Uh it uses your github Id

143
00:19:13.530 --> 00:19:18.470
Tracy Kuhrt: in order to allow for voting. And since all of the voters must be

144
00:19:18.590 --> 00:19:32.790
Tracy Kuhrt: active maintainers Um, that shouldn't be a problem for people. Um. And then uh, the email will be sent out to those eligible voters on how they will cast their ballots.

145
00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:52.100
Tracy Kuhrt: The ballots will be cast um The election will close at eleven. Fifty-nine pm Us. Pacific time on November thirtieth I believe this tool sends out um reminders. So there's no sort of reminder email that has to be manually done. Um! It's automated through the tool,

146
00:19:52.110 --> 00:20:02.929
Tracy Kuhrt: and then that vote will determine that the six elected Toc members uh whose whose names will be removed from the appointment. Boat

147
00:20:03.150 --> 00:20:06.539
Tracy Kuhrt: questions are kind of the election, timely and process.

148
00:20:16.130 --> 00:20:32.419
Arnaud J Le Hors ("Arno"): So Tracy, I don't have a question. I have a comment or good observation I wanted to share with everybody. Uh, this is the first time we have this kind of setup where there's a number of seats that actually get selected, and the others are pointed by the board.

149
00:20:32.610 --> 00:20:48.130
Arnaud J Le Hors ("Arno"): I, you know I just want to say. Obviously I cannot speak on behalf of the board, and I cannot predict how they will actually do it. But I can share from my experience in another foundation where there is a similar setup,

150
00:20:48.210 --> 00:20:57.739
Arnaud J Le Hors ("Arno"): the way they do it. Unless there is a need to do any different, they will basically continue down the list of the election results,

151
00:20:57.860 --> 00:21:17.259
Arnaud J Le Hors ("Arno"): and as long as they're happy with what the mix that this gives them. They will just do that. They are not going to bother going for other people running another election or any of this. They will pick the people from, you know. Well being run running in the election, anyway,

152
00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:25.669
Arnaud J Le Hors ("Arno"): because that's kind of like by default. If that gives us the right mix they are hoping for That makes it very easy for them to do

153
00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:27.820
Arnaud J Le Hors ("Arno"): so.

154
00:21:29.810 --> 00:21:34.009
Tracy Kuhrt: Okay, that's extremely interesting. Um. So

155
00:21:35.070 --> 00:21:38.540
Tracy Kuhrt: I guess One of the things that I was

156
00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:41.989
Tracy Kuhrt: uh thinking about your Arnold is that

157
00:21:42.450 --> 00:21:45.969
Tracy Kuhrt: I don't know that

158
00:21:46.000 --> 00:22:01.020
Tracy Kuhrt: we should be distinguishing and letting people know whether they that load it in, or appoint it if you will. Um, So I wasn't expecting to share the results uh, except internally within the Hyper Ledger staff.

159
00:22:01.150 --> 00:22:12.810
Tracy Kuhrt: Uh the actual results of the vote. But if I hear what you're suggesting, you're suggesting that that those remote results would also be shared with the governing board members, so that they could

160
00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:30.799
Tracy Kuhrt: um determine whether or not they want to to choose the next five, or choose some other.

161
00:22:30.810 --> 00:22:36.789
Arnaud J Le Hors ("Arno"): They they, in the case of open Ss. They announced the people had been elected,

162
00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:54.740
Arnaud J Le Hors ("Arno"): and then they say, Okay, there is. I forget It's Three more seats or four more seeds will be the appointed by the Board and the Board say, Okay, this is the people. But I actually I don't know, maybe public to be honest, but I know for a fact that you know they just took the next people on the list,

163
00:22:57.630 --> 00:23:16.829
Arnaud J Le Hors ("Arno"): and they were happy with the mix that they gave them. So they were like, Okay, that satisfies us anybody. They had to vote quickly within the board to say, Yeah, happy with that good. And they announced the next. You know, people had been appointed by the Board as being also members

164
00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:22.570
Arnaud J Le Hors ("Arno"): of the attack, and that's it. So I a again, I mean, you know

165
00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:27.580
Arnaud J Le Hors ("Arno"): they may, it may go differently here, but

166
00:23:27.750 --> 00:23:34.240
Arnaud J Le Hors ("Arno"): based on my experience, the A left staff will tend to say, Hey, this is how we do it elsewhere.

167
00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:37.709
Arnaud J Le Hors ("Arno"): You might want to consider doing it that way, too.

168
00:23:37.730 --> 00:23:41.570
Arnaud J Le Hors ("Arno"): And again, I mean, they will exercise their right to

169
00:23:41.670 --> 00:23:59.580
Arnaud J Le Hors ("Arno"): all variety. The results, if they feel like this, is not giving them the right mix, which is the whole point of having this this feature right? They say. No, it's just using this too many people from the same project. The same company We're better off going down further into the least of,

170
00:23:59.590 --> 00:24:03.560
Arnaud J Le Hors ("Arno"): but most likely they won't, You know

171
00:24:04.430 --> 00:24:23.000
Arnaud J Le Hors ("Arno"): they they They will stop from there, at least right because they know these are people who have nominated themselves and are willing to do the job to stop with, which is easier than going to fish for other people and say, Hey, you didn't run for the election. But really we'd like you to be on this

172
00:24:23.010 --> 00:24:26.919
Arnaud J Le Hors ("Arno"): on this talk so that there is diversity uh

173
00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:39.510
Arnaud J Le Hors ("Arno"): it's not again. I mean they. They may very well do it, but you know it seems pretty clear to me that they will try to find the easy way first to fill those seats.

174
00:24:39.890 --> 00:24:56.620
Tracy Kuhrt: Yeah, we we specifically. I made sure that the based on our conversations previously that the Charter specifically says that the governing board has to choose from the nominees um that they cannot go outside of the the list of

175
00:24:56.640 --> 00:25:04.730
Tracy Kuhrt: uh because of the whole like you didn't sign up. Uh maybe you didn't want to do the job. And now you're being forced to do a job that you didn't really

176
00:25:05.830 --> 00:25:21.510
Tracy Kuhrt: um, but I I do think it's an interesting sort of uh perspective on now, and I think um. We have a Government board meeting on Monday, and I think i'll bring that up. I don't think uh Daniel on this call, but uh

177
00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:29.169
Tracy Kuhrt: um try to talk to Daniela before the call, just to let him know that i'll bring up kind of this election process. Um,

178
00:25:29.190 --> 00:25:41.629
Tracy Kuhrt: so that there can be some discussion about what the governing board wants to do whether or not they want the the results from the vote, or whether they want to start with the list of nominees minus the the

179
00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:44.940
Tracy Kuhrt: uh six elected Tsc. Numbers

180
00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:47.470
Arnaud J Le Hors ("Arno"): sounds good.

181
00:25:47.930 --> 00:25:53.040
Tracy Kuhrt: Okay. Other other comments or questions on the election process itself.

182
00:26:00.110 --> 00:26:16.579
Tracy Kuhrt: Okay. So then, uh, with the appointment process, this may change based on that conversation with the company boy, but the the intent was to take the Tsc. Nominee. These exclude the six elected poc members and have the governing board vote um

183
00:26:16.690 --> 00:26:31.970
Tracy Kuhrt: for a period of about a week. Um! Which was what was suggested by Min uh, we had. I had this much longer, but she suggested just a a short period for the governing board. Um, so we'll,

184
00:26:32.530 --> 00:26:51.070
Tracy Kuhrt: I guess, uh the intent was to use opa boat um, which is what we've used in the past for the to use the elections. It's what the governing board uses for any sort of elections that they have. Um. The process really is to send out an email and a reminder email and to have the election close on the night.

185
00:26:51.140 --> 00:27:08.509
Tracy Kuhrt: Um, The ninth is a Friday. So I did um say that on the twelfth an email would be sent to the Ts. Coc mailing list announcing the newly elected and appointed members Um, and then that group of people would elect the uh,

186
00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:25.339
Tracy Kuhrt: the new toc chair and vice chair. Now I gave a a long period for that. I don't know that it's going to take um that long. Uh, but this is obviously the holiday period, and so there are vacations and things that I expect people to be on. And so I want to make sure

187
00:27:25.350 --> 00:27:38.930
Tracy Kuhrt: that we gave time on the front end and the back end of those holidays to um, ensure that everybody had a chance to express their desire for the to Oc. Chair and vice chair,

188
00:27:38.940 --> 00:27:53.459
Tracy Kuhrt: and that, as far as the the election goes, it'll be very similar to what we've done in the past, where, uh, there's an election for the chair, and then the person who gets the second highest votes would get the Vice chair

189
00:27:57.280 --> 00:28:02.050
Tracy Kuhrt: Questions on the appointment process, or that share vice, chair, election,

190
00:28:09.650 --> 00:28:12.810
Tracy Kuhrt: quite group today.

191
00:28:13.140 --> 00:28:21.880
David Enyeart: Either that mean think they're good or uh things are so bad that that you don't want to comment. Um,

192
00:28:23.810 --> 00:28:37.289
Victor Gridnevsky: if I may. A little question. Okay, Okay. So I had some small contribution to, and I was actively supporting uh with all the questions people had.

193
00:28:38.390 --> 00:28:42.409
Victor Gridnevsky: So, even with that am I allowed to participate?

194
00:28:42.910 --> 00:28:51.389
Tracy Kuhrt: You are definitely allowed to nominate yourself. Um. Given the conversation that you had uh, as far as

195
00:28:51.500 --> 00:29:00.109
Tracy Kuhrt: uh the voting process. I guess the question is, Victor or you missed it as a maintainer in the maintainer's files in the roots.

196
00:29:00.850 --> 00:29:01.829
Aleksandr Petrosyan: He is

197
00:29:02.230 --> 00:29:07.489
Tracy Kuhrt: okay. Uh. So if you are listed as a maintainer that you would be allowed to vote,

198
00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:13.810
Tracy Kuhrt: assuming that you had active um contributions uh which it sounds like. You have

199
00:29:14.290 --> 00:29:15.420
Victor Gridnevsky: okay,

200
00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:23.410
Tracy Kuhrt: Other questions or comments on the election,

201
00:29:24.010 --> 00:29:28.670
Tracy Kuhrt: and they don't have to be on this page. It's like to be very similar to what Victor just have.

202
00:29:29.270 --> 00:29:33.640
Aleksandr Petrosyan: I have one who is eligible to vote.

203
00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:35.450
Aleksandr Petrosyan: And uh,

204
00:29:36.860 --> 00:29:44.340
Aleksandr Petrosyan: basically um, what happens if people decide not to do it? Um! Is there a a quorum that needs to be reached?

205
00:29:45.420 --> 00:29:53.519
Tracy Kuhrt: Okay, uh. So it's on. If you in mind going back up to the top where we have the charter. Uh. So for the a dot

206
00:29:54.840 --> 00:30:09.470
Tracy Kuhrt: reading to um elections will be administered and oversee by the Tsc. All maintainers for similar technical role in the case of supported projects which we don't have any currently supported projects. Um. So

207
00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:20.709
Tracy Kuhrt: uh, all maintainers of any technical project who have been active in the past year will elect six individuals. So if you've been an active maintainer in the last year,

208
00:30:20.740 --> 00:30:38.380
Tracy Kuhrt: then you will be eligible to vote. Uh you are not required to vote. But you are eligible to vote as we've never had any sort of form for people to vote, and we still don't have any sort of Forum for people to vote

209
00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:43.229
Aleksandr Petrosyan: Excellent! Thank you.

210
00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:49.339
Tracy Kuhrt: Other questions comments

211
00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:59.779
Tracy Kuhrt: uh Peter, so I uh

212
00:31:00.660 --> 00:31:01.980
Peter Somogyvari: no problem

213
00:31:02.220 --> 00:31:10.659
Peter Somogyvari: uh from me. It's just a quick thumbs up. I think this is a good idea, and i'm happy that you're working on it. And i'll be curious to see how it goes.

214
00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:14.050
Tracy Kuhrt: Alright, Thanks, Peter.

215
00:31:26.850 --> 00:31:31.110
Tracy Kuhrt: Okay. Uh. So that was the end of the official agenda.

216
00:31:31.230 --> 00:31:35.939
Tracy Kuhrt: Is there anything else that anybody would like to cover?

217
00:31:42.950 --> 00:31:43.950
Tracy Kuhrt: All right?

218
00:31:45.920 --> 00:32:03.730
Arun S M: Yes, so this is related to this security task force. Um, I know I missed the previous call, but I not caught me up. Um! It's that I mean this week. And then he updated the discussions that he had with heart, and then he also brought in some of the interesting conversations from Open, as you said,

219
00:32:08.990 --> 00:32:11.080
Arun S M: Um, and

220
00:32:11.140 --> 00:32:20.260
Arun S M: there will be few explorations going on in the coming days from by by the task force which we will come up with

221
00:32:20.510 --> 00:32:21.410
Arun S M: um

222
00:32:21.660 --> 00:32:23.290
Arun S M: as proposals here.

223
00:32:24.260 --> 00:32:31.100
Arun S M: There is one pending action. Item that Um, it is overdue, for now I know I promised it soon after that

224
00:32:31.410 --> 00:32:35.099
Arun S M: the Global Forum event. But I could not do it.

225
00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:36.950
Arun S M: That is related to

226
00:32:37.630 --> 00:32:39.790
Arun S M: um. How do we

227
00:32:41.330 --> 00:32:47.599
Arun S M: and the the the security process itself? Right? The reviewing? How can somebody come and report? And

228
00:32:47.790 --> 00:32:50.570
Arun S M: what are the actions to be taken by each team.

229
00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:59.209
Arun S M: It's again listed under open Ss. Um. We had one deep conversations on that when I think few weeks ago,

230
00:33:00.090 --> 00:33:07.389
Arun S M: and the heart that suggested that we should probably incorporate the ones that are non-controversial.

231
00:33:18.590 --> 00:33:23.979
Arun S M: Okay, just an update on what's happening, And I do request everyone to please participate

232
00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:25.780
Arun S M: and the task force.

233
00:33:27.890 --> 00:33:30.080
Tracy Kuhrt: Alright, Thanks so much for the update.

234
00:33:31.860 --> 00:33:34.950
Tracy Kuhrt: Anything else that anybody would like to cover.

235
00:33:42.060 --> 00:33:59.099
Tracy Kuhrt: So um! Before I let you go, I know you guys all wanted to get out of here. But um! Before I do let you go, one of the things that I wanted to bring up was our backlog items uh that we do have uh still open. One is on the security process which is being

236
00:33:59.110 --> 00:34:04.570
Tracy Kuhrt: uh handled via the security task force, but the other one is Um

237
00:34:05.620 --> 00:34:06.970
Tracy Kuhrt: is

238
00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:13.179
Tracy Kuhrt: related to the projects who have not submitted their Tsc. Quarterly project updates um

239
00:34:13.340 --> 00:34:29.129
Tracy Kuhrt: and moving them to a dormant state after a Tsc. Discussion and possible votes. I do know that there were a number of comments on this um back when it was originally open. Um, we haven't made any sort of

240
00:34:29.230 --> 00:34:33.889
Tracy Kuhrt: further progress on what we want to do specifically with this

241
00:34:33.909 --> 00:34:51.610
Tracy Kuhrt: um with this particular issue, whether or not we want to implement this, whether or not we want to close it, and then maybe we could have a quick discussion on any thoughts that people might have on this particular backlog item uh, i'd really like to see if we could address it

242
00:34:51.830 --> 00:34:54.669
Tracy Kuhrt: before the end of this term,

243
00:34:55.440 --> 00:34:59.900
Tracy Kuhrt: one way or the other, be it close it, or take action on it.

244
00:35:01.090 --> 00:35:10.990
Tracy Kuhrt: So uh, just as a a reminder, the idea was to uh for those who had not uh put in their quarterly project updates.

245
00:35:11.080 --> 00:35:18.969
Tracy Kuhrt: Um. Do you have the Ts vice chair reach out to the projects when they miss submitting the the project updates um

246
00:35:19.230 --> 00:35:22.439
Tracy Kuhrt: via either um

247
00:35:22.550 --> 00:35:41.469
Tracy Kuhrt: reaching out to the last emitter of the project quarterly update, reaching out via the project mailing list and reaching out via the project's official chat channel, uh, and then we're unable to reach someone for an entire quarter, we would have a discretion within the technical oversight Committee to ten minutes

248
00:35:41.480 --> 00:35:45.310
Tracy Kuhrt: uh we should vote on moving the project to a dormant state.

249
00:35:45.810 --> 00:35:56.660
Tracy Kuhrt: Uh, so I I know this came up when we had some projects. Who hadn't submitted their I think it was borough Actually, when they had each minute they report for probably about

250
00:35:56.680 --> 00:36:11.310
Tracy Kuhrt: um a half a year. And so this was something that I created as a potential action that we could take, and I want to see if we want to. Uh, you know, implement this, or if we think this is not needed

251
00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:15.850
Tracy Kuhrt: any thoughts

252
00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:17.180
Tracy Kuhrt: All right

253
00:36:18.250 --> 00:36:26.160
Arun S M: right. I think I kind of remembered this discussion with it. It got diverted to another discussion as well where

254
00:36:26.460 --> 00:36:45.850
Arun S M: um people started asking, Should we even make this decision, because project teams could be busy on doing some things. And then there was other kind of discussion that went into asking if report is what we expect from each of the project every quarter. Then what what is it that we expect from each of that report? Can we extract that

255
00:36:46.390 --> 00:36:51.219
Arun S M: for the time being, and then ask project teams to update when they when they can.

256
00:36:51.420 --> 00:37:05.219
Arun S M: But then um! The other thinking that I also have is we will be reaching out to project maintenance, and if they are not submitting quarterly report, or at least they should be responding back to the question that uh

257
00:37:05.290 --> 00:37:07.109
Arun S M: members would ask them;

258
00:37:07.230 --> 00:37:10.919
Arun S M: and if they are not even responding to the questions, then it's E.

259
00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:14.790
Arun S M: It's equal to that project is not responding to any

260
00:37:14.850 --> 00:37:30.679
Arun S M: concerns with their project. Right? So if they're not responding to uh, the t will say itself, How can they respond? So we can imagine, like, what kind of response structure would they have for new contributors? For somebody who is new to the project?

261
00:37:35.690 --> 00:37:41.820
Arun S M: Project has not responded to any of the questions itself. That definitely is a concern.

262
00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:55.600
Tracy Kuhrt: Yes, completely agree that it's a big concern. Uh, we want people to be able to get responses from the project. Uh, if they have issues or they're looking to make contributions.

263
00:37:55.810 --> 00:37:56.790
Tracy Kuhrt: I know.

264
00:37:57.580 --> 00:38:05.060
Arnaud J Le Hors ("Arno"): Yeah, I mean I My My gut reaction is, we don't need to add anything, because this is

265
00:38:05.100 --> 00:38:22.910
Arnaud J Le Hors ("Arno"): this is why we have this quarterly reports, and it was to you know it. Make sure that you know projects are still going on, and uh, you know, have a hard bit, so to speak, and so it seems to me that this is a natural, you know,

266
00:38:22.920 --> 00:38:41.569
Arnaud J Le Hors ("Arno"): possible outcome of the project, not responding, not feeling out the quarterly reports, and I don't know that we need to add a special rules stating that. But I I I was trying in the back to go to the website, I would Uh,

267
00:38:44.010 --> 00:38:53.949
Arnaud J Le Hors ("Arno"): it depends on whether we specify the way we specify how you enter. Doleman states basically exclude the talk doing this,

268
00:38:53.980 --> 00:39:23.010
Arnaud J Le Hors ("Arno"): then we would have to change it. To say, Oh, one of the possibilities is, the talk has not heard from the project, such as you know, not receiving any quarterly reports, and therefore the talk might decide to move the project to dormant. But I think in a sense, we've seen this actually happen already without that rule. Right that we we we've seen in the cases of the existing projects we had like a borough, and where

269
00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:38.510
Arnaud J Le Hors ("Arno"): we knew, you know, every time they had to like, you know. Like. Ask them repeatedly, Hey, where's your report? Where your report? And then eventually they themselves at the That's okay. Forget it. We can't keep doing this. So

270
00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:52.799
Arnaud J Le Hors ("Arno"): I yeah I my my you know. Again, I I think I don't feel like this is necessary in general. I think we shouldn't just keep adding more rules for the sick of it. And this is strictly needed.

271
00:39:53.680 --> 00:40:12.589
Tracy Kuhrt: Okay, and I know it. Project and or the dominant state. When the normal functions are suspended, or so down for a period of time, the Tfc. Decides to move the project to or from the domain, State upon request or just not, say who requests that? Uh it just says upon request.

272
00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:31.960
Tracy Kuhrt: Um! So I think you know, if the Tsc. Is requesting it, then the Tsc. Um obviously can make that determination as to whether or not it makes sense to go to the German State. So um sounds like we want to close this issue. Any anybody want to see this issue may open and that we do

273
00:40:31.990 --> 00:40:33.120
Tracy Kuhrt: that it.

274
00:40:44.050 --> 00:41:00.090
Tracy Kuhrt: Okay. Um, Then we will close this issue, since somebody uh wanted to take action

275
00:41:01.020 --> 00:41:04.349
Tracy Kuhrt: works for me. I will do that. I know. Um.

276
00:41:05.010 --> 00:41:06.069
Tracy Kuhrt: Thank you.

277
00:41:06.140 --> 00:41:09.860
Tracy Kuhrt: Any other items to discuss today.

278
00:41:17.870 --> 00:41:37.839
Tracy Kuhrt: Well, we will then close out the meeting and thank you all for attending hopefully. Next week we will be talking about the A non Prince project Uh, uh, Steven is attempting to get that ready for us. Uh, we also do have uh the prune lab that would like to present to us at some point.

279
00:41:37.850 --> 00:41:56.880
Tracy Kuhrt: Um, i'll decide whether or not that's next week depending on whether Stevens ready for us uh next week or not. I don't want to do both of them at the same time. So um, we do have both of those on the backlog of agenda items for upcoming meetings. So with that I will close today's meeting, and I wish you all a good week.

280
00:41:58.510 --> 00:42:00.209
Angelo De Caro: Thank you.
