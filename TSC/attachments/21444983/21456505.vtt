1
00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:14.700
Tracy Kuhrt: Right welcome everyone to the July 28 hyper ledger typical steering committee call, as you are always two things that we must abide by.

2
00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:23.760
Tracy Kuhrt: The first is the antitrust policy notice that is displayed on the screen and the second is our code of conduct.

3
00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:31.080
Tracy Kuhrt: So, as we move down the agenda we have our standard announcement.

4
00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:48.000
Tracy Kuhrt: The Dev weekly developer newsletter doing this for memory goes out each day if you have something that you would like to add to that please can sit are clicking on the link and there's a wiki page where you can add your comments.

5
00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:57.510
Tracy Kuhrt: If somebody was lying whoever sharing their screens going down on the agenda Thank you so much, any other announcements that anybody has.

6
00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:05.580
Tracy Kuhrt: A room.

7
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:18.570
Arun S M: So i'm Julian Gordon VP for Asia Pacific archetypal Nigeria is currently visiting India, and there are a couple of events planned so he's in India for a week now.

8
00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:31.680
Arun S M: And this Saturday, there is a public meetup event in Bangalore so if anybody's around or if you know somebody in Bangalore please let them know about the event and yeah it will be an in person event.

9
00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:38.760
Tracy Kuhrt: anybody else have any announcements.

10
00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:58.920
Tracy Kuhrt: Okay, if there's no other announcements we get get in the hyper ledger side to quarterly report or with a slight glitch with our project calendar reporting.

11
00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.470
Tracy Kuhrt: It was supposed to be self sooth not transact with it last week we had transact on the list, but.

12
00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:13.260
Tracy Kuhrt: In the let me know that it was supposed to be so teeth she got the reminder for safety net reminder for transact looking at the calendar, I did see that.

13
00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:22.260
Tracy Kuhrt: The student got reversed, for some reason in this quarter, so I fixed that we could get the sawtooth report, please take the time to review it.

14
00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:29.970
Tracy Kuhrt: didn't see any additional comments can do other than the ones I made but does anybody have any comments on the sawtooth report.

15
00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:48.750
Tracy Kuhrt: Okay, I know a lot of us haven't had the opportunity to review that yet since it just came in yesterday, please take the opportunity to review that I will leave it on the.

16
00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:54.480
Tracy Kuhrt: Meeting Agenda for next week in case anything comes up that we need to discuss.

17
00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:04.110
Tracy Kuhrt: Next week we have coming do the hyper ledger areas and the hyper ledger indie reports so if you know anybody in those.

18
00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.880
Tracy Kuhrt: projects.

19
00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:10.320
Tracy Kuhrt: please feel free to remind them that they have that coming do.

20
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:20.940
Tracy Kuhrt: With that, as far as I know we don't have any PC business to discuss this week, but does anybody have anything that we should be bringing up to discuss.

21
00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:30.360
Tracy Kuhrt: Will.

22
00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:49.230
Arun S M: Show Chris a ticket pasted similar comments on the tsa group as well sometime back and ties back to what kind of projects should we attract and what should we do to make those projects incubated and the hyper ledger labs or hyper ledger, how do we invite those collaboration.

23
00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:56.130
Arun S M: And I don't know, maybe we can open it up for comments and then, if not now, but please sometime in future.

24
00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:05.340
Tracy Kuhrt: And does this relate early think to the project gaps task force that they know has been.

25
00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.120
Tracy Kuhrt: Leading or Is this something else.

26
00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:24.180
Arun S M: sure we can consider them part of the task force as well, and I think the task force is aimed at identifying the gaps, but it also am I, how do we.

27
00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:29.820
Arun S M: collaborate or bring in those those kind of projects or how do we start those projects.

28
00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:40.290
Danno Ferrin: I when I put the objectives that I think the collaboration of the bringing in is the next step, so I think it's two phase so yeah I think it, it does feed from the task force.

29
00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:47.490
Danno Ferrin: project as a task force results, but I think it would be a separate Task Force actually more than a task force and ongoing thing.

30
00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:51.900
Danno Ferrin: To outreach to projects, we think that would be positive for hyper ledger.

31
00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:57.900
Danno Ferrin: So I think it's from stems from it, but I don't think we should limit it to the task force activities.

32
00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:08.670
Tracy Kuhrt: In a room do are there, certain projects that you think would be worthwhile to approach at this point.

33
00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:11.370
Tracy Kuhrt: This why this is coming to your mind.

34
00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:32.700
Arun S M: Some ice, I see a need for using some of those projects so that's where the name comes from and if such thing does not exist anywhere and and if others are also willing to I mean show an interest, then that could be an initiation of how we take that forward like.

35
00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:39.000
Arun S M: Ours where to find some will if many people have similar interests, maybe that could be an initiation.

36
00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:45.030
Arun S M: So yeah I was hoping for those kind of discussions to happen at some point.

37
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:48.960
Tracy Kuhrt: Okay, I think.

38
00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:52.170
Tracy Kuhrt: The two things they are waiting.

39
00:05:53.520 --> 00:06:06.840
Tracy Kuhrt: You know, obviously, after the project gaps Task Force, we can talk through projects that may hit the gaps that we discover frank during that test scores, and then secondly.

40
00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:19.680
Tracy Kuhrt: let's see what we can do if you have certain projects you already have in mind to get that list together so that we can have a more focused sort of conversation.

41
00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:28.950
Tracy Kuhrt: Alright, so with that any other discussion items before we move on to the Security Task Force.

42
00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:49.290
Tracy Kuhrt: Alright i'm seeing a coffee, it says i'm away on the screen here so everyone I think you're supposed to be driving us through the screen Task Force today.

43
00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:51.840
Tracy Kuhrt: Hoping you're not really away.

44
00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:09.330
Tracy Kuhrt: Alright sounds like maybe he is is there anybody else on the screen passports, you might be able to let us know current status and what we're discussing today.

45
00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:24.180
Tracy Kuhrt: look like maybe around your.

46
00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:29.070
Arun S M: hbc i'm sorry I got disturbed.

47
00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:30.330
Arun S M: It was an emergency call.

48
00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:33.600
Arun S M: What was the topic I missed probably.

49
00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:39.630
Tracy Kuhrt: yeah, so I think we're at the point where we're ready to go through this task force.

50
00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:48.960
Arun S M: Alright sounds from the previous call that we had it Casey I think one of the feedback that we strongly received was that.

51
00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:53.400
Arun S M: least recommendations are fine, but what are we doing about.

52
00:07:54.930 --> 00:07:56.610
Arun S M: Income sharing the right screen.

53
00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:00.900
Tracy Kuhrt: see a black screen with a line down the middle.

54
00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:14.610
Ry Jones: same thing.

55
00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:25.440
Arun S M: i'd say is my.

56
00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:31.830
Arun S M: screen is lost it's asking me to resume, but when I click on resume nothing happens.

57
00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:37.200
Ry Jones: Is there is there a wiki page or something that I should share.

58
00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:41.280
Arun S M: Sure that's the task force recommendation page.

59
00:08:55.350 --> 00:09:02.820
Arun S M: Alright, so one of the strong feedback that we received in previous previous Casey call was that we needed concrete proposals and not.

60
00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:03.870
recommendations.

61
00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:17.070
Arun S M: And we needed plan of actions that as a tasc we can ask projects to start implementing and since then we got to meet, for once, and next.

62
00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:29.370
Arun S M: August Second, we have the next meeting, but if you scroll down to the bottom, I think, in the previous call we were trying to come up with the concrete proposal fours on after item or of the action item.

63
00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:37.410
Arun S M: So the first point i'll probably skip that every project to have a security representative, I guess, we already added that in our.

64
00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:47.370
Arun S M: requirement project requirement for any project or even incubator we need that as a requirement and the second point that is put up or here in terms of concrete proposal.

65
00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:49.080
Arun S M: So.

66
00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:54.870
Arun S M: Does this related to addressing CBS on a timely fashion.

67
00:09:55.920 --> 00:10:14.100
Arun S M: And, and the recommendation over here is, we definitely don't want to be pushy for all the CV spike, at least for the political winds and the definition of criticality goes with the score that's associated with it, so, at least for the ones that are highly.

68
00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:31.470
Arun S M: Highly coming up, which are more critical, which are easy to discovered, and these are the factors that will determine if a CV is critical and to be objective on to it it's it's it can be considered as anything that is that is having a score of greater or equal to seven.

69
00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:33.960
Arun S M: and

70
00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:38.730
Arun S M: And the proposals or I mean the goal over here is to avoid.

71
00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:43.920
Arun S M: Any such things being left out without fixing them for a long time.

72
00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:47.910
Arun S M: And can we can we treat them as a.

73
00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:54.120
Arun S M: Highly exploitable once that ought to be addressed so nice.

74
00:10:55.500 --> 00:11:07.530
Arun S M: So the proposal is that every project will be should be a best practice badge I know Tracy you had a comment on that, but i'll probably just complete this and then we'll go into questions.

75
00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:25.740
Arun S M: So the proposal is to have a best practice badge issued to all the projects and this badge will be issued on an automated basis in, and this will be reviewed or reconsidered every quarter, based on the projects report that they fill up to the tasc.

76
00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:43.470
Arun S M: And when a particular project is incubated this batch will be awarded to it on the basis that it, it is incubated and the badge will remain with the project as long as they retain the status, the status of it in case if the project is is.

77
00:11:45.930 --> 00:11:53.760
Arun S M: Is not maintaining the conditions which are side further than the badge will be revoked and if about badges revoked.

78
00:11:54.450 --> 00:12:04.500
Arun S M: Then the project has to prove that they are following the process again, and they have to prove it for two consecutive quarters following relocation.

79
00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:12.390
Arun S M: So that was the intention, so there is no punitive measures over here it's all about having that extra badge that gives.

80
00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:20.580
Arun S M: The confidence to the consumer of that particular project saying that hey this project is pretty much active in considering at least fixing the.

81
00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:34.350
Arun S M: Critical vulnerabilities right Ideally, we would like to have all of those to be fixed and into in order to support this in our quarterly reports will introduce a question that clearly states that.

82
00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:47.910
Arun S M: If you're going if a particular project has any critical vulnerability, with a score of or here, it is assumed to be seven and again that's open for debate, we can always revise it to another number.

83
00:12:48.660 --> 00:13:08.160
Arun S M: So we will ask the question if the score if they have any see we that are not fixed for more than 90 days and if s what which are those, and this is on the premise died after 90 days, all the series will be made available public.

84
00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:18.390
Arun S M: And, of course, there will be consent, taken from the project and project team has to give an explanation for why it should not be reported.

85
00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:21.330
Arun S M: So that's an exception process.

86
00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:24.450
Arun S M: Then.

87
00:13:25.530 --> 00:13:31.140
Arun S M: Right, so the next point actually talks about extension process and how long.

88
00:13:32.910 --> 00:13:39.120
Arun S M: Such extension can be alone so to such extensions can be given, but not more than that.

89
00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:51.360
Arun S M: In this entire process itself will take the CV to be more to be to be active for more than like close to three quarters right so that's The next point.

90
00:13:52.620 --> 00:14:02.280
Arun S M: And the last point, as I said, it deals with the revocation and the rules for gain gaining back to back to be to be on the normal list.

91
00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:13.440
Arun S M: So this was the only concrete proposal that we were able to put up after that call and next call is on second I think I see I know Tracy and heart racing.

92
00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:15.000
Arun S M: No, no.

93
00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:18.960
Danno Ferrin: So one of the things to consider in this is that.

94
00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:21.900
Danno Ferrin: We don't hold all the cards when it comes to see the recording.

95
00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:28.950
Danno Ferrin: Whoever proposes CV they're engaging and responsible disclosure in agreement that they won't disclose it.

96
00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:33.810
Danno Ferrin: After certain reasonable time and 90 days is a pretty standard thing let's there's negotiation.

97
00:14:34.410 --> 00:14:42.060
Danno Ferrin: But you know these might be research there's an after 90 days they might say, I need to publish a paper and unless it's going to burn down the Internet i'm going to publish it.

98
00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:50.220
Danno Ferrin: So I mean we can you know how these rules to delay publishing the CDS but sometimes the project or hyper ledger is not a control.

99
00:14:50.640 --> 00:15:00.090
Danno Ferrin: Of when the CV gets disclosed so that's that's one one aspect to consider in this, as we can use all the characteristics, we want, but we don't control the destiny on it sometimes.

100
00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:08.310
Arun S M: Okay, thanks for that input data.

101
00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:10.260
Arun S M: etc.

102
00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:12.510
Tracy Kuhrt: yeah so.

103
00:15:14.730 --> 00:15:15.960
Tracy Kuhrt: Three points.

104
00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:21.510
Tracy Kuhrt: Maybe we'll start with the second ones relates to what data just said.

105
00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:30.840
Tracy Kuhrt: You know I think in here mentioned that If yes please list the CBS I think that is a no no.

106
00:15:31.950 --> 00:15:42.480
Tracy Kuhrt: Yes, from the perspective of if it truly is a CV and it has an eviction Should we really be reporting it out into a document that is publicly available to anyone.

107
00:15:43.470 --> 00:15:51.060
Tracy Kuhrt: My second point here is I don't know what the score is greater than or equal to seven actually mean so for those of us who.

108
00:15:51.930 --> 00:15:56.940
Tracy Kuhrt: are not familiar with that maybe we need to be more specific about what it is that 70 reflects.

109
00:15:57.660 --> 00:16:04.590
Tracy Kuhrt: very much a magic number in my mind, and then the last point that I have is the one that I made in the comments which is.

110
00:16:05.370 --> 00:16:16.290
Tracy Kuhrt: I feel like a badge even to a project that's never have had a TV that says this project is following the best practices for handling CVs.

111
00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:22.680
Tracy Kuhrt: is not accurate right, I would prefer that if we do this, we have like a.

112
00:16:23.190 --> 00:16:32.940
Tracy Kuhrt: never had a CV type badge and a yes, this project has dealt with all their CVs within the whatever this 90 day period might look like right or.

113
00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:51.870
Tracy Kuhrt: Within the the timeframe that has been agreed with whoever with the reporter was so I think you know there's there's some challenges with clay me, you are good at something that you've never done and then also when you restore the badge.

114
00:16:52.890 --> 00:17:08.010
Tracy Kuhrt: You know, after they've resolved that particular CV I think it's not quite right, either because we still don't know that they're good at dealing with CDs within the amount of time that had been specified, so I just feel like we need to be a bit more.

115
00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:16.200
Tracy Kuhrt: Robust in how we're issuing these badges and when we're revoking these badges and when we're reissuing the badges.

116
00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:28.350
Arun S M: Thanks Tracy i'm a late until probably call it that round Robin fashion.

117
00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:33.780
Hart Montgomery: hey thanks yeah great points Tracy and Dan oh.

118
00:17:35.070 --> 00:17:48.900
Hart Montgomery: I do want to it wasn't clear to me whether we were still by default releasing CVs after 90 days I think you know the automatic release without petition to the tasc is a good thing.

119
00:17:49.950 --> 00:17:54.810
Hart Montgomery: Is data, points out, you know a lot of CVs are found by researchers and other people that.

120
00:17:56.010 --> 00:18:00.840
Hart Montgomery: That have incentives to release them and particular we've even seen some CVs.

121
00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:15.600
Hart Montgomery: brought by competitors that have you know lots of financial incentives to release CVs on hyper ledger stuff so you can guarantee that they're going to get released, you know as soon as the minimum window is.

122
00:18:16.890 --> 00:18:17.310
Hart Montgomery: You know.

123
00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:27.090
Hart Montgomery: is reached, so you know, I think, by default, you know, we should be releasing CVs after 90 days.

124
00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:31.110
Hart Montgomery: You know, and I also wonder, you know about the scoring.

125
00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:38.490
Hart Montgomery: You know the scoring is always a little bit subjective so so i'd worry that that could be gained a little bit.

126
00:18:39.990 --> 00:18:50.220
Hart Montgomery: You know, so if this were you know totally up to me, I would just say let's release all CVs in 90 days you know sort of no matter what happens.

127
00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:56.820
Hart Montgomery: You know, unless people ask for a tasc and if something is very minor you know.

128
00:18:57.960 --> 00:19:01.020
Hart Montgomery: Well, maybe you can release it if it's not totally fixed right.

129
00:19:02.250 --> 00:19:07.710
Hart Montgomery: But you know that that sort of addresses the point here, which is we want people addressing.

130
00:19:08.730 --> 00:19:16.200
Hart Montgomery: You know, high high severity CVs you know, but we should also be transparent about the less severe CVs.

131
00:19:17.550 --> 00:19:29.400
Hart Montgomery: So so i'd prefer like a mandatory release policy, because I think in practice we're going to have to pretty much do that anyway and there's no reason to hold these back.

132
00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:33.210
Hart Montgomery: i'd be curious to hear what everyone thinks about that.

133
00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:40.170
Arun S M: Thanks.

134
00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:41.460
Arun S M: All right, Hello.

135
00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:43.650
Arnaud J Le Hors ("Arno") @ IBM: Yes, hi guys.

136
00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:59.370
Arnaud J Le Hors ("Arno") @ IBM: And I just I missed the call Task Force I since, in the reschedule I don't have it on my agenda to fix this I actually meant to attend, but so my point on this is that, in fact, a bit of for up to what Dan on our third.

137
00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:11.220
Arnaud J Le Hors ("Arno") @ IBM: The I mean the openness of recommendation is that we should try to engage with the reporter and try to negotiate the time frame for the disclosure.

138
00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:23.970
Arnaud J Le Hors ("Arno") @ IBM: And, as you know, often said that mean they may have their own you know timeline and the experience shows that, in fact, they are not always.

139
00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:35.700
Arnaud J Le Hors ("Arno") @ IBM: Nice players and you know it might be, because there is competitive incentives, but there may be all sorts of reasons why people don't necessarily want to respect.

140
00:20:36.030 --> 00:20:48.810
Arnaud J Le Hors ("Arno") @ IBM: You know, to give you enough time to fix the issue and so that's the reality we're dealing with it's, to the point where openness SF is actually now planning on developing a guide for.

141
00:20:49.860 --> 00:20:57.840
Arnaud J Le Hors ("Arno") @ IBM: For reporters and it's well understood that they may ignore it, of course, but the thought is that maybe if you know.

142
00:20:58.230 --> 00:21:05.580
Arnaud J Le Hors ("Arno") @ IBM: We give them an insight as to what it's like to be on the other side they might be more amenable to negotiating rather than.

143
00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:12.030
Arnaud J Le Hors ("Arno") @ IBM: forcing their own schedule on on the project which sometimes can be quite challenging right.

144
00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:24.960
Arnaud J Le Hors ("Arno") @ IBM: yeah you have to figure out whether this is real, you have to be able to reproduce it, you have to figure out the fix, and this may even with all good intentions for the project, it may still quite you know take quite some time.

145
00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:32.760
Arnaud J Le Hors ("Arno") @ IBM: And so I think it's important here to take that into account, and I agree with Dan or that you know just saying oh.

146
00:21:33.090 --> 00:21:45.150
Arnaud J Le Hors ("Arno") @ IBM: 90 days well in some cases they may be, you know agreeable to make it longer if you know it's a really hard problem to solve, and they might accept to give you more time.

147
00:21:45.510 --> 00:22:01.800
Arnaud J Le Hors ("Arno") @ IBM: and other cases they may just say well screw how i'm going to release it next week and you just have to live with it, so I think did the I think a policy needs to reflect that you know, this is not cast in stone and it, it is.

148
00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:06.870
Arnaud J Le Hors ("Arno") @ IBM: dependent on the reporter and their willingness to negotiate or not.

149
00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:13.290
Arun S M: Thanks, that was a.

150
00:22:14.610 --> 00:22:18.240
Arun S M: That was an option we did not know about things that a try.

151
00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:29.400
Troy Ronda: So just a few thoughts I think the first thought is you know part of this proposal sounds a little bit like information gathering better transparency.

152
00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:34.830
Troy Ronda: Another part is this the badge concept.

153
00:22:36.870 --> 00:22:40.290
Troy Ronda: And you know i'm curious you know.

154
00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:54.510
Troy Ronda: I am curious you know if the badge part is is important aspect of this or just the idea that there should be some easily discoverable information about the CD stats for a project.

155
00:22:55.500 --> 00:23:08.520
Troy Ronda: So I think you know, maybe if maybe if the focus was on on the more of the transparency aspect, and not so concerned about you know rural setting about badging that might be easier to get started.

156
00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:18.750
Troy Ronda: And my other thought is that you know projects like areas that have less and more mature sub projects within them.

157
00:23:19.770 --> 00:23:28.800
Troy Ronda: A badging exercise like this might be fairly difficult right, whereas you know stats gathering with point easier So those are my thoughts here.

158
00:23:32.490 --> 00:23:33.000
Arun S M: Thanks right.

159
00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:37.740
Arun S M: um Okay, I think we have so many questions to discuss.

160
00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:50.520
Arun S M: And debate about so i'll probably start with to try, so the intention is not to have a badge but intention is to have it easily consumable and probably.

161
00:23:51.960 --> 00:24:02.700
Arun S M: incentivize projects to to do their best so that the consumers of that project they feel confident about the project.

162
00:24:03.750 --> 00:24:08.880
Arun S M: So that's the intention behind it so badge is probably the easily convey.

163
00:24:10.170 --> 00:24:20.580
Arun S M: An idea for somebody who's just looking into project, and they want to know hey can I trust this project, or is the project maintain to the standards that we expect.

164
00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:25.710
Arun S M: And if there are other recommendations, apart from bypassing Dennis.

165
00:24:26.850 --> 00:24:28.650
Arun S M: will come those as well.

166
00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:33.930
Arun S M: and probably this ties back to the the idea that Tracy was talking about.

167
00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:49.590
Arun S M: Right, we may not be good but single type of bike because of certain reasons that in a project is incubated they have not done any best practices issues that are starting to work in an open source community.

168
00:24:50.160 --> 00:25:01.320
Arun S M: So they may not be X, they may not have exposed to certain scenarios which other projects might have already been exposed maybe not all their maintenance or occupied doing something else.

169
00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:13.170
Arun S M: So it completely agree on that aspect some, if not a best practice in terms of CV we can always say that the project is as.

170
00:25:15.690 --> 00:25:26.460
Arun S M: is good for last two quarters right in terms of how they are managing their CV so that can be a badge and that badge definition, can go by saying that.

171
00:25:27.330 --> 00:25:35.490
Arun S M: The project is in good shape, for the last two quarters and it's it's given through these reports and other means and.

172
00:25:36.390 --> 00:25:50.070
Arun S M: Either retired know CBS reported or it's following it's best to to address them so that can be a badge and again, it can be bad or it can be any other means of conveying that message.

173
00:25:51.930 --> 00:25:54.030
Arun S M: And to another point.

174
00:25:56.040 --> 00:26:04.080
Arun S M: That spoke about extensions and the minimum I mean disclosing it after minimum number of days that are.

175
00:26:06.270 --> 00:26:17.430
Arun S M: that's an interesting aspect, and also, I guess that ties back to what are not set in terms of negotiating with the person who has raised, I was issued that CV right.

176
00:26:18.750 --> 00:26:19.620
Arun S M: So.

177
00:26:20.790 --> 00:26:31.680
Arun S M: I have added that as a comment in the notes letting the page is not in edit mode that so it's not showing up, but we will discuss that in the task force call to see.

178
00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:41.760
Arun S M: If we need to do anything for now I think disclosing that after 90 days without having any extensions, because some of them, as you said, it is not in.

179
00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:51.960
Arun S M: Our control that makes sense, and we can put that up and i'm not sure if projects would be happy to do it, though.

180
00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:59.010
Arun S M: At least from us from a process point of view, we can state that and.

181
00:27:02.550 --> 00:27:03.450
Arun S M: Did I miss any point.

182
00:27:06.210 --> 00:27:11.700
Troy Ronda: Just from my point projects like areas which are more client frameworks and not blockchains.

183
00:27:12.810 --> 00:27:20.130
Troy Ronda: have multiple projects within them, so these proposals 10 maybe night to address that issue that.

184
00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:35.280
Troy Ronda: Something like areas may have a very, very fresh sub project vs no more long running some project and it's fairly difficult to have this global rule just for like say something like areas across the board.

185
00:27:36.930 --> 00:27:38.010
Arun S M: I agree so each.

186
00:27:38.340 --> 00:27:44.430
Arun S M: repositories and or each project, but in Aries is considered as independent one like that's what you mean.

187
00:27:45.420 --> 00:27:45.960
yeah.

188
00:27:47.310 --> 00:27:51.900
Troy Ronda: there's like several different frameworks and completely different containers right so.

189
00:27:53.280 --> 00:28:01.890
Troy Ronda: it's a it's more challenging with with that kind of framework project than like see the blockchain projects to have a kind of a global scope like this.

190
00:28:09.090 --> 00:28:11.160
Arun S M: um hey our time, please.

191
00:28:11.310 --> 00:28:17.430
Hart Montgomery: yeah I mean choice choice point makes sense, but there's no reason we couldn't do this sub project by sub project right.

192
00:28:18.690 --> 00:28:35.280
Hart Montgomery: You know, ultimately, we still want to you know indicate to folks like you know whether people are following best security practices or not, and if if you know if we need to do it sort of like repub by repo or sub project by project, you know I don't see why that would be an issue.

193
00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:39.210
Hart Montgomery: With that satisfies your concerns Troy.

194
00:28:41.970 --> 00:28:48.420
Troy Ronda: yeah, I guess, we have to start identifying that a little bit better um but I mean I think part of my point was just um.

195
00:28:49.770 --> 00:28:58.440
Troy Ronda: You know I think the information, transparency thing is easier than you know trying trying to adjudicate badging is just like personal side as well, so.

196
00:28:59.310 --> 00:29:00.690
Hart Montgomery: yeah totally agree with you.

197
00:29:08.910 --> 00:29:16.380
Nathan George: I would read the report transparency thing doesn't go away with this, and I wonder if, maybe there's, something that would actually help general.

198
00:29:16.830 --> 00:29:30.900
Nathan George: Project discovery if we had the maintainer group repositories and say these things are all part of one hole and these things are all each kind of stand alone, maybe because they're different implementations of the same protocol, or because.

199
00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:39.840
Nathan George: There may be different plugins that are on the sit on top of the core and so a foreigner building one doesn't necessarily reflect on the others.

200
00:29:40.410 --> 00:29:50.940
Nathan George: It feels like that organization in that making that hierarchy more visible would help with both the badging and in making the project more approachable.

201
00:29:54.030 --> 00:29:57.060
Arun S M: So um I think going by that tried so.

202
00:30:00.750 --> 00:30:12.120
Arun S M: Far the things which we use as a libraries as a dependency, sometimes we see that hey this particular framework has an issue by Andre in this programming language or so.

203
00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:23.430
Arun S M: that's one consideration, but again, the question is how do we show that out to be showcased to consumers.

204
00:30:24.510 --> 00:30:25.200
Arun S M: Point taken.

205
00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:28.080
Arun S M: expect and hey Tracy.

206
00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:34.740
Tracy Kuhrt: I think i'd like to really highlight and again on a suggestion, because I think it's not.

207
00:30:36.180 --> 00:30:40.260
Tracy Kuhrt: it's not going through and so maybe we can state it a different way, which is.

208
00:30:41.610 --> 00:30:49.830
Tracy Kuhrt: focused on the data first right, what is the data that you want to collect about CBS and that data is.

209
00:30:51.900 --> 00:31:03.090
Tracy Kuhrt: CV name, date reported maybe the person who reported it the date that it was resolved, which would then allow you to calculate you know how many days was passed.

210
00:31:03.570 --> 00:31:10.740
Tracy Kuhrt: Whether or not, that was within the agreed upon days to resolve right so maybe that's an initial sort of capture make.

211
00:31:11.550 --> 00:31:21.660
Tracy Kuhrt: A point of data that you capture right once you get all these points of data that you want to capture about a CV, then you can decide what type of badges right and maybe it's.

212
00:31:22.170 --> 00:31:35.880
Tracy Kuhrt: You know here's a couple of sequel statements or whatever you want to call to say like this is the data, you would need to see what the average amount of time, it was the results eat for this project that's repo this whatever it is that we're talking about right.

213
00:31:37.260 --> 00:31:38.430
Tracy Kuhrt: This is the.

214
00:31:39.540 --> 00:31:50.970
Tracy Kuhrt: You know number of times that the cbe was resolved within the agreed upon timeframe, you know all of these sorts of data is available, then to you after you get.

215
00:31:51.630 --> 00:32:08.310
Tracy Kuhrt: That data collected and from there, you can decide what the badges are so let's I think Troy suggestion is really good, and so I want to see if we can focus instead of badges what is the data that we need in order to determine whether or not a project is doing good resolving their CDs.

216
00:32:12.330 --> 00:32:14.910
Arun S M: Thanks race excellent point makes sense.

217
00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:24.030
Arun S M: We need to figure out what kind of data, we can collect I think all the data points docusign should be, we should be able to get those.

218
00:32:27.930 --> 00:32:36.090
Arun S M: And I guess I missed one other point I think you you wanted to understand how did we come up with a score seven and what does that really indicate.

219
00:32:36.690 --> 00:32:44.970
Arun S M: score seven as use it for now is is a magical number, so we just consider that anything greater than seven to be critical.

220
00:32:45.510 --> 00:32:53.940
Arun S M: But I can we can change it right, so that was that was a proposal and we had that in mind when when writing this proposal.

221
00:32:54.540 --> 00:33:18.930
Arun S M: And I think is sharing the screen and whenever somebody reports I in issue, they will have to fill through our answered list of questions and so it's a pre set list of questions in a sense that we have to know like how much of a way, am I, giving for each of these aspects of tissue.

222
00:33:20.070 --> 00:33:29.220
Arun S M: And, based on what a particular reporter is is saying we the calculators like it determines the score of that particular CV.

223
00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:39.630
Arun S M: And once it gets reported and probably While talking to them, and we can like there can be a process which.

224
00:33:40.260 --> 00:33:47.820
Arun S M: Which is established which which were a particular maintain or somebody can go there and talk to them and tell them hey.

225
00:33:48.420 --> 00:33:56.550
Arun S M: I see that you have considered this particular aspect of the high, but for from from our definitions, because we assume certain things in the project.

226
00:33:57.180 --> 00:34:09.960
Arun S M: Our security threat model does not consider these cases so that's where we don't think this is high, so we, we will change this tool it's a another value and that can reduce the score as well.

227
00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:21.570
Arun S M: So this score gets calculated through these questionnaires that somebody answers and one of the recommendation that the task force also hide pause.

228
00:34:22.140 --> 00:34:30.150
Arun S M: Since we are dealing with blockchain technology and multi party systems, if needed, we will bring in additional set of questions into this.

229
00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:45.660
Arun S M: To have are meant to have influence on this code that gets calculated and those additional set of questions could be very specific to blockchain technology, and this, it should work for the core protocols projects like we have about six of them in hyper ledger.

230
00:34:49.380 --> 00:34:54.660
Arun S M: Again that's not imposed on all the projects and the hyper ledger it specifically for those.

231
00:34:57.870 --> 00:34:58.710
Ry Jones: also want to.

232
00:34:58.890 --> 00:34:59.490
Ry Jones: I was showing.

233
00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:04.680
Ry Jones: Earlier for fabric, we have this public dashboard.

234
00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:13.020
Ry Jones: which shows the number of reports are policy etc and.

235
00:35:14.670 --> 00:35:16.350
Ry Jones: You can dig into this and see.

236
00:35:18.300 --> 00:35:25.530
Ry Jones: How many CBS cetera so there's more clicking you can do, I will post a link to this in the discord chat.

237
00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:32.760
Tracy Kuhrt: And is a scoring minute.

238
00:35:33.780 --> 00:35:49.260
Tracy Kuhrt: Looking at the site it's github github COM Is this something that is built into github and, if so, how would we go about making those changes that you're suggesting a room about you know they're selecting specific types of things that would need to be at it.

239
00:35:50.970 --> 00:35:58.140
Ry Jones: I can answer the first part this this is built into github what I did for this was I started a draft security advisory on the governance repo.

240
00:35:59.160 --> 00:35:59.760
Ry Jones: And then.

241
00:36:01.710 --> 00:36:03.360
Ry Jones: Just started answering these questions.

242
00:36:05.940 --> 00:36:08.910
Ry Jones: And once once you get a score here.

243
00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:16.530
Ry Jones: You can go in here and set this yourself if you want, I will give you a walkthrough at a at a later date.

244
00:36:22.860 --> 00:36:24.930
Arun S M: Right, I see how to raise.

245
00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:27.390
Hart Montgomery: Contact yeah I would also take.

246
00:36:27.570 --> 00:36:29.220
Hart Montgomery: A lot of the CV scores.

247
00:36:29.250 --> 00:36:38.820
Hart Montgomery: The big grain of salt so, for instance, if you have a bug bounty program you know everyone wants to extract more money.

248
00:36:40.080 --> 00:36:46.230
Hart Montgomery: From the program so they generally, we see that people try to inflate their scores when possible.

249
00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:57.420
Hart Montgomery: You know and that's one thing, the other hand, if it's like someone from a project reporting a CV sometimes they will tend to under report it.

250
00:36:58.530 --> 00:37:11.280
Hart Montgomery: So you know, we should be careful with the CV scores, particularly for for the bug bounty programs and CVs that are that come through that way.

251
00:37:20.970 --> 00:37:27.480
Ry Jones: I will say that I spend a lot of time closing basically bogus reports on hacker one.

252
00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:32.700
Ry Jones: So hearts point about over inflated is.

253
00:37:34.170 --> 00:37:35.250
Ry Jones: Yes, very much so.

254
00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:40.710
Arun S M: I think.

255
00:37:40.740 --> 00:37:46.650
Arun S M: One other question that you hi Tracy was when we have our own set of questions, how do we consider them and.

256
00:37:48.300 --> 00:37:51.810
Arun S M: Here right so that aspect is is not exploded.

257
00:38:13.890 --> 00:38:14.370
Ry Jones: What.

258
00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:16.260
Arun S M: Do you want to see on the screen.

259
00:38:17.730 --> 00:38:18.180
Arun S M: i'm.

260
00:38:19.290 --> 00:38:31.320
Arun S M: Sorry, I think that the question that Tracy had was in when we bring in our own set of questions which other than the one that we saw Nikita preach, how do we consider those in the scoring criteria.

261
00:38:36.150 --> 00:38:37.620
I think that's an open question.

262
00:38:39.240 --> 00:38:39.480
Arun S M: Like.

263
00:38:51.690 --> 00:39:01.170
Arun S M: So um I would require request the thc and also the the maintainer stuff all the projects to join in the next Security Task Force meeting on Tuesday.

264
00:39:02.430 --> 00:39:20.130
Arun S M: Because that's really the time where we dig some of these questions into deeper and we we do discuss a lot of not many things, and the summary over here captures it's probably a gist of what happened in the call but there's a lot that goes into those cons.

265
00:39:35.010 --> 00:39:39.810
Tracy Kuhrt: Okay, is there anything else or anybody on the screen test for us would like to cover today.

266
00:39:49.230 --> 00:39:50.580
Tracy Kuhrt: I will take that as a no.

267
00:39:51.930 --> 00:40:04.380
Tracy Kuhrt: So, I guess, we will say that we are complete, for today next week Bobby will be presenting some of the work that they've been doing in the learning materials working group.

268
00:40:05.250 --> 00:40:16.140
Tracy Kuhrt: To come up with some guidelines around documentation, or they had a task force going on there, so we'll let Bobby and to present that to us next week.

269
00:40:16.830 --> 00:40:28.770
Tracy Kuhrt: If there's any other items that people think we should discuss as a tlc, please let me know and we will make sure to get that on the agenda as well, and with that I will close out the meeting for today.

270
00:40:30.150 --> 00:40:31.260
Tracy Kuhrt: Thank you all for attending.

271
00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:33.390
sure.
