1
00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:38.430
Tracy Kuhrt: Alright, welcome everybody to the April 7 hyper ledger technical steering committee call, as you are probably all aware, we have two things that you must abide by on this call First is the antitrust policy notice that is currently displayed on the screen.

2
00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.580
Tracy Kuhrt: And the second is our code of conduct, which is linked in the agenda.

3
00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.240
Tracy Kuhrt: So with that let's go ahead and get started with the agenda.

4
00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:03.180
Tracy Kuhrt: Right, so far as our announcements go, we have the hyper ledger Dev weekly developer newsletter that goes out each Friday to.

5
00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:17.820
Tracy Kuhrt: Hundreds of hyper ledger developers, if you have something that you would like to have included in that newsletter please leave a comment at the wiki page that is linked in the agenda and.

6
00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.770
Tracy Kuhrt: The second announcement that we have is the hyper ledger global forum.

7
00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:46.470
Tracy Kuhrt: is currently get the CFP open until April 29 so you have a couple more weeks to get your CFP isn't as heart had mentioned last week there's a call for program committee volunteers, that is currently open and heart, maybe talk about package is kind of embraced.

8
00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:54.870
Hart Montgomery: excited Tracy for most of you on this call if you're interested in being on the program committee for the Global Forum, please reach out.

9
00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:09.630
Hart Montgomery: We are looking for strong volunteers and you know the tlc fits that bill so we'd love to hear from you, I will be reaching out to many of you that I think might be interested.

10
00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:17.100
Hart Montgomery: individually, but if you're interested, please, please feel free to go ahead and reach out and thank you for your time.

11
00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:41.520
Tracy Kuhrt: It takes heart and then the last announcement that I put on here is just a reminder to review the pull request that is out there on adding a page on the kfc responsibilities that are now has so graciously written, for us, so please take take an opportunity to do that Bobby.

12
00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:54.750
Bobbi Muscara: Yes, hi everybody, I just wanted to put this out there, the learning materials working group is formed a task force to do this, best practices and standard documentation.

13
00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:09.780
Bobbi Muscara: Information so if anybody has any articles or information that you think would be of interest during our fact finding two weeks, which starts started on Monday, please post it in our discord page Thank you.

14
00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:12.570
Tracy Kuhrt: Bobby or no.

15
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:25.080
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): Yes, thank you hi everyone, I just wanted to say one more piece on the PR on tsu responsibilities, I mean we there are some.

16
00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:32.070
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): I mean, I think there are parts that are not controversial, but there are their ideas of addition and.

17
00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:43.020
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): I mean, of course, you know I expect this to be formally voted on by the tsa as a whole, eventually, before this gets merged but.

18
00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:52.200
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): It would be best if people you know at a peek at it and you know see if there's anything that you think is missing or, more importantly, that you disagree with.

19
00:03:52.680 --> 00:04:07.770
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): Because I mean technically, this is kind of what we're supposed to live by once, and so it better represent what you think is reasonable for you as a team Member, you know to to to be signed an nda.

20
00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:21.990
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): So when I You know, as I said, I mean eventually I suppose you will ever say when you get to vote, but you know earn your input would be better, so I encourage people to come in and look.

21
00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:24.300
Tracy Kuhrt: yeah definitely thanks.

22
00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:32.340
Tracy Kuhrt: All right, any other comments as far as announcements that people would like to me.

23
00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:55.350
Tracy Kuhrt: Okay, and no additional announcements so for quarterly reports, we still have the hyper ledger explorer quarterly report that we're waiting on I know there are discussions going on about the project offline.

24
00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:57.420
Tracy Kuhrt: To.

25
00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:02.520
Tracy Kuhrt: determine how best to to move forward and so.

26
00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:21.600
Tracy Kuhrt: You know, hopefully, once we get some answers, there will actually hear back from the explore team with what they're what they're planning and then, as far as upcoming reports we have the cactus and the fabric reports that are due next week and so just fyi that those are coming up.

27
00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:40.680
Tracy Kuhrt: As far as discussion items I do not i'm not aware of the discussion items for today's TC business, please let me know if that is not correct if anybody has anything TC business that we should discuss before we get to the task force discussion let's bring that up now.

28
00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:47.010
Ry Jones: I just have a quick question, who is the Indian blockchain Institute.

29
00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:50.340
Ry Jones: we're trying to take taking.

30
00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:54.210
Kamlesh Nagware: An inbox to do.

31
00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:57.270
Ry Jones: yeah is this kamalesh or.

32
00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:01.740
Kamlesh Nagware: yeah, so this is a snippet which attack brand.

33
00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:03.510
Kamlesh Nagware: Okay, unless.

34
00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:06.960
Ry Jones: Okay, we were just trying to take role, thank you.

35
00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:10.350
Kamlesh Nagware: So, and so you're not aware.

36
00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:13.740
Ry Jones: No there's no issue, we were just trying to.

37
00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:21.540
Ry Jones: Do the roll call for the tlc and we weren't we weren't sure who that was whether or not you're representing a tlc number that's all.

38
00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:23.190
Kamlesh Nagware: Okay okay yeah.

39
00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:25.320
Ry Jones: yeah you're you're more than welcome to stay for the meeting.

40
00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:27.090
Kamlesh Nagware: Okay.

41
00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:29.040
Daniela Barbosa: Just rename yourself cameras.

42
00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:32.430
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): Right exactly I was going to say, maybe it doesn't.

43
00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:35.220
Kamlesh Nagware: Anybody actually locked in at that.

44
00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:38.010
Kamlesh Nagware: Oh.

45
00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:43.410
Kamlesh Nagware: He just he doesn't plan meeting with it, it integrated.

46
00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:44.970
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): No problem.

47
00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:52.710
Tracy Kuhrt: Alright, so any other PC business that we should discuss.

48
00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:04.230
Peter Somogyvari: Just a quick one for me, I will have to leave that to halftime other.

49
00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:18.390
Tracy Kuhrt: Right there's nothing else, then I guess i'm handing it off to you to walk through the task force discussion.

50
00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:22.050
Danno Ferrin: And I can share the screen for my.

51
00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:23.790
Danno Ferrin: screen.

52
00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:25.410
Danno Ferrin: Here we go.

53
00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:29.910
Danno Ferrin: browser tonight.

54
00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:41.520
Danno Ferrin: cool so today we're starting the projects gas Task Force on this is a task force when we.

55
00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:49.470
Danno Ferrin: thought of the four main tasks worse we're going to be rotating through this as one idea that I might think it's time for a hyperlink.

56
00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:59.280
Danno Ferrin: To consider apparently other TEAM members did when this commitment is one of the ideas to be less of protest force and that is to figure out, you know what projects are we missing in hyper ledger.

57
00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:16.350
Danno Ferrin: So let's the performing arts, you know make as efficient task force or possibly compete completed list of deliverables so the three things to complete our figure out first identify project areas hyper ledger would want X projects.

58
00:08:17.850 --> 00:08:27.540
Danno Ferrin: That we don't already have and the next two tasks, I think, related to that and then basically fall off of that decision was to figure out the scope we want for that one of them is to.

59
00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:36.480
Danno Ferrin: identify which labs project could deliver those leads those needs and figure out which ones have money and get more support to as thc Members and to encourage other people to join.

60
00:08:37.050 --> 00:08:42.240
Danno Ferrin: And the second one is possibly to identify other sources were products may be solicited from.

61
00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:49.260
Danno Ferrin: Maybe we need to say hey, we need a project in this area that doesn't have existing code and encourage people to start the new project and maps.

62
00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:53.160
Danno Ferrin: Or maybe there's a project outside of hyper ledger that isn't attached to another group.

63
00:08:53.490 --> 00:09:05.520
Danno Ferrin: That might be willing to come in, and I know that specifically how hyper ledger basic came and it was a project that consensus and Brian came to us and asked us to come join a board so that has been a half it's been been worked before.

64
00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:16.020
Danno Ferrin: So the deliverables to affect these these three tasks um I think the first thing we need to do is, we need to have a discussion about the overarching philosophy.

65
00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:24.960
Danno Ferrin: The kinds of projects hyper ledger foundation wants to host this because there's been discussion like you know how to what extent we do, do we read you know.

66
00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:33.360
Danno Ferrin: there's been statements by the tsa in the past we don't want specific applications we don't want to host like a commercial websites project that has the blockchain.

67
00:09:33.690 --> 00:09:43.560
Danno Ferrin: As an open source thing that's out of bounds but there's other things which have grown in bounds, such as the identity libraries that have come in that we're not necessarily part of the initial hyper ledger scope.

68
00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:53.880
Danno Ferrin: So we should probably before we you know get too entrenched in saying you know I want this project come on board figure out what the boundaries are for the project that we think are good fits.

69
00:09:54.270 --> 00:09:58.050
Danno Ferrin: And also that might help us identify areas that are we think might be kind of folder with me.

70
00:09:58.530 --> 00:10:10.980
Danno Ferrin: that the notion of Level one deal tease we got already six of them five of them now in hyper ledger for them are active projects we don't necessarily need more, but we might need a project that support interrupting a hot area.

71
00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:21.870
Danno Ferrin: So from that we would get a list of specific project themes are areas from that philosophy and we would also in that list I think we'd want to include which current projects we haven't finished to those teams.

72
00:10:22.530 --> 00:10:31.560
Danno Ferrin: To show what we have, and that would better identify what the gaps are to show what we have don't have so we can fill in fill in the gaps as the name the project get force.

73
00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:42.150
Danno Ferrin: And then list of labs projects that might be good fits to fill in these uh these gaps and list of affiliate unfilled needs that we would need this list of projects for whatever means.

74
00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:52.770
Danno Ferrin: i'm thinking of putting a time box on this of three months since will be three meetings in the in the tasc and probably two or three off.

75
00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:54.870
Danno Ferrin: Thursday meetings.

76
00:10:56.370 --> 00:10:57.690
Danno Ferrin: um so.

77
00:10:58.830 --> 00:11:09.540
Danno Ferrin: To that end, the first thing I would propose is, we would need to discuss when we want to meet on or off nonsense, because I don't think we can get all this work done just on three calls three that CSC.

78
00:11:10.410 --> 00:11:20.160
Danno Ferrin: My initial proposal would be two weeks from now on a Tuesday, at the same time of this call, are there any other proposals have been brilliant think a better time I might exist.

79
00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:30.330
Danno Ferrin: Going once.

80
00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:35.910
Danno Ferrin: Does this conflict with anyone's project call I guess is a good question this time.

81
00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:45.150
Bobbi Muscara: know.

82
00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:52.680
Danno Ferrin: So don't Let me share screen, you can see everyone's emojis that well this one completed that this.

83
00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.550
Danno Ferrin: make this as big as possible cool.

84
00:11:59.310 --> 00:12:02.640
Danno Ferrin: So the next can all set up a zoom meeting, if it is on the call.

85
00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:10.080
Tracy Kuhrt: Just in case you can't see Bobby you had your hand up did you have something.

86
00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:14.910
Bobbi Muscara: No, I just wanted to see that time works for doesn't conflict.

87
00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:19.890
Tracy Kuhrt: I think there was a.

88
00:12:24.270 --> 00:12:24.750
Danno Ferrin: Okay.

89
00:12:34.950 --> 00:12:39.720
Danno Ferrin: So the next part you go into this House where I think we get more in the open discussion and.

90
00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:46.260
Danno Ferrin: Just I don't I can't drive home and i'm going to need a lot of health and this one, but people brainstorming ideas for what.

91
00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:54.240
Danno Ferrin: The hyper ledger project philosophy we might want to express with this a tranquil and then after that product areas these kind of inner operate and overlap.

92
00:12:54.720 --> 00:13:01.740
Danno Ferrin: But i'd like to start, initially with with philosophy ideas and then the areas we can move back and forth if we need to as we get some of those ideas.

93
00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:11.130
Danno Ferrin: So i'm calling for people on the floor, what are some good project philosophy here, you know what what are some bullet points is what type later project should fill.

94
00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:17.310
Danno Ferrin: Everyone who wants.

95
00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:20.910
Danno Ferrin: Or maybe we shouldn't do, what should we do.

96
00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:22.620
Danno Ferrin: Jim.

97
00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:34.320
Jim Zhang: yeah I feel like integration with public teams should be a major philosophy I don't know that if that fits under this category of philosophies.

98
00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:47.520
Jim Zhang: This either running because, at least with our customers, we see a lot of repeating patterns that using permission chains, I saw I side chains, but integrate with public change to inject value back and forth.

99
00:13:48.750 --> 00:13:52.440
Jim Zhang: Scott, I be pretty popular.

100
00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.770
Jim Zhang: pattern happy to hear thoughts from other other people.

101
00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:02.790
Danno Ferrin: i'm Peter.

102
00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:16.170
Peter Somogyvari: I would say that we could add the idea in there, that if a project was to come in.

103
00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:35.160
Peter Somogyvari: But they're not necessarily a perfect match for our what kind of projects we want rule, but the product already has a substantial and big relatively big Community around it and also maintainer and also contributors.

104
00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:55.260
Peter Somogyvari: Then we should reconsider it even if it's not exactly a match, because the other day for that project based on the Community and the number of contributors and maintain errs, we can say that the people have voted that this is something that should be.

105
00:14:56.460 --> 00:15:02.220
Peter Somogyvari: worked on and so, in those cases, I think we could relax.

106
00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:08.010
Peter Somogyvari: Project project acceptance criteria in terms of.

107
00:15:09.150 --> 00:15:10.500
Peter Somogyvari: The relevance of it.

108
00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:16.920
Danno Ferrin: And so, this.

109
00:15:19.230 --> 00:15:24.030
Danno Ferrin: Statement of that large projects like the joining to let that are not matches should quote unquote growth philosophy.

110
00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:30.330
Peter Somogyvari: yeah yeah sure.

111
00:15:41.610 --> 00:15:42.030
Okay.

112
00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:50.430
Danno Ferrin: How about the kinds of projects.

113
00:15:57.420 --> 00:15:59.790
Danno Ferrin: What is hyper ledger is for looking goal or no.

114
00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:04.290
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): i'm sorry i'm not answering your question, I will.

115
00:16:05.550 --> 00:16:18.540
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): I wanted to suggest that we may also want to set some limits, and you know i'll historically, for instance, we decided to stay away from all the cryptocurrency stuff.

116
00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:37.170
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): Is that something we still want to enforce or not, and you know I raised it as a question I think is important to basically set limits if we have some you know explicitly state what we wouldn't want to do as well as what we are interested in doing.

117
00:16:41.610 --> 00:16:50.310
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): I mean there's plenty of stuff on the web three, for instance, is that someday we want to get in or is that something we feel like no we're not part of this.

118
00:16:53.790 --> 00:17:13.050
Danno Ferrin: Okay, so I wasn't very active, the first few years of hyper ledger I did the first few meetings and then took some years off, but when you say that hyper ledger initially state from cryptocurrency what did that feel like what was the direction of that um maybe harkins a letter or no.

119
00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:24.900
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): Well, I Peter let hot to speak, but you know from my perspective, it was at the time, especially it was felt like okay.

120
00:17:25.470 --> 00:17:37.830
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): There is all this stuff about cryptocurrency happening on rady and what we're interested in is really the the blockchain for the enterprise use case which was not so much cryptocurrency oriented.

121
00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:54.840
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): And so there was a clear intent, not to focus on cryptocurrency and we didn't want to be overwhelmed by everything that was already up in in the cryptocurrency space, so it was a there was, I think, an intent to kind of differentiate ourselves from all the crypto stuff.

122
00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:00.630
Danno Ferrin: Our end up.

123
00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:03.540
Hart Montgomery: I guess, this is a pretty fine line, though.

124
00:18:05.250 --> 00:18:06.480
Hart Montgomery: You know what.

125
00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:29.430
Hart Montgomery: You know I don't think there's a there's a strong line between running something and hosting software, but you know there's a fine line between you know what is a cryptocurrency and what can be used for crypto currency and all of these things.

126
00:18:31.470 --> 00:18:45.780
Hart Montgomery: So you know, like is a central bank digital currency, a cryptocurrency right because we have a lot of we have a lot of people, building on our platforms for those you know so.

127
00:18:47.730 --> 00:18:48.630
Hart Montgomery: I think.

128
00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:53.010
Hart Montgomery: there's there's a fine line here.

129
00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:08.160
Danno Ferrin: distinguish between the software used to run the live network and the live network itself will be uh.

130
00:19:09.810 --> 00:19:21.360
Hart Montgomery: yeah I think we always have their dinner sorry to jump back in and like if we want to actually, this is not just a hyper ledger thing this is even like a Linux foundation, I think.

131
00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:25.680
Hart Montgomery: If we wanted to actually run software, we would.

132
00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:29.550
Hart Montgomery: probably have to get like everybody at the top of that left to approve us.

133
00:19:30.690 --> 00:19:33.180
Ry Jones: Right cruces had her hand up for a bit.

134
00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:34.530
Danno Ferrin: yeah.

135
00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:42.420
Tracy Kuhrt: No problem so yeah i'm curious as to whether or not our tagline is still blockchain for business.

136
00:19:43.950 --> 00:19:52.260
Tracy Kuhrt: And if it is, then I think that's a place that we really need to say that the focus that we have is enterprise.

137
00:19:53.760 --> 00:20:04.620
Tracy Kuhrt: You know, I think that it's very possible that, if you take us away from kind of a roots are the foundations of that blockchain for business tagline.

138
00:20:05.370 --> 00:20:14.280
Tracy Kuhrt: That you end up with a situation where hyper ledger becomes a completely different organization than it is today, and i'm not sure if that's what.

139
00:20:14.790 --> 00:20:30.510
Tracy Kuhrt: hyper ledger foundation actually once and the Governing Board once per se right like I think those are important discussions and maybe discussions that it really do need to be had at the governing board if you're changing the mission or vision of hyper ledger foundation.

140
00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:38.310
Danno Ferrin: Am I pointing this wasn't the trains down the line and trying to go how the philosophy works within the current charter vision.

141
00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:42.330
Danno Ferrin: Launching for businesses tagline what that what that means.

142
00:20:42.810 --> 00:20:52.170
Danno Ferrin: In that, because I think if we're going to change the your I agree with you, if we're going to change the whole basis of hyper ledger that is a higher level issue and more of an existential question so yeah.

143
00:20:53.070 --> 00:21:06.780
Danno Ferrin: To put some limits on this I don't think we should discuss the existential but how the current philosophy of watching for business where we should go into that and what projects, we should look for um I think our know how does, and so did you have any more Tracy.

144
00:21:08.190 --> 00:21:14.910
Tracy Kuhrt: I know I think that when they get to project areas, I think, maybe that'll clarify some of this as well.

145
00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:17.490
Danno Ferrin: Okay, or no, I think you were next.

146
00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:37.050
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): yeah I wanted to follow up on on what hot said, I totally agree with him, this is obviously we never prevented you know anybody from building cryptocurrency system on top of the software that we are building and indeed there's a lot of project now, in the space of CBC.

147
00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:46.110
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): And that's totally fine, I think, indeed the distinction was really the difference between building software.

148
00:21:49.470 --> 00:21:51.240
Danno Ferrin: really just faded out, it was that man.

149
00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:53.970
Tracy Kuhrt: lost him as well.

150
00:21:56.310 --> 00:21:58.530
Ry Jones: yeah sorry or know we lost you there.

151
00:22:00.750 --> 00:22:09.120
Danno Ferrin: I think there's a big difference between building software and building a network which I think is an important one to be completely lose them we completely lost them no we didn't.

152
00:22:11.490 --> 00:22:14.340
Danno Ferrin: Anyway, but I think his point was made i'm.

153
00:22:14.490 --> 00:22:14.940
Jim.

154
00:22:16.470 --> 00:22:25.530
Jim Zhang: yeah honestly I don't think we have a real worry of being mixed up with cryptocurrency communities, because.

155
00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:33.030
Jim Zhang: Those communities would not trust a business oriented foundation like hyper ledger for their technology.

156
00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:39.930
Jim Zhang: we've seen for darragh, for example, trying to do this right, and I think their successes debatable.

157
00:22:41.130 --> 00:22:46.380
Jim Zhang: So I think our angle and to me it's always clear that.

158
00:22:47.790 --> 00:22:58.920
Jim Zhang: We are interested in permission works, but I think it's a unstoppable trends that permission networks cannot continue to run.

159
00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:02.640
Jim Zhang: As silos they are going to.

160
00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:14.160
Jim Zhang: integrate with public networks, where the the value right the trillions of dollars of value exist because that's how you engage.

161
00:23:15.180 --> 00:23:24.570
Jim Zhang: With the general public for for value to flow in into and out of your side chains, so I think.

162
00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:30.090
Jim Zhang: At least for me it's it's us embracing.

163
00:23:31.410 --> 00:23:52.530
Jim Zhang: Technology and then the advancement in the public side and help our customers to to utilize them rather than the other way around, that we will build stuff for the for the public side, and I think would not be successful as a corporate indoors entity to do that kind of thing.

164
00:23:55.050 --> 00:23:55.260
Danno Ferrin: I.

165
00:23:57.390 --> 00:24:09.300
Danno Ferrin: heard a lot of discussion about cryptocurrencies and value networks and public networks are financial use cases, the only use cases for this um I guess nathan's probably jumping into answer my question, or do you have a different answer.

166
00:24:10.290 --> 00:24:16.050
Nathan George: Oh, I had a different comment, but I also think that that's a really interesting question because part of what I.

167
00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:25.470
Nathan George: What got me to get into hyper ledger and was got me excited about it is the availability of experts who knew things I didn't know.

168
00:24:25.770 --> 00:24:31.500
Nathan George: or who had insights into other parts of the ecosystem that I wouldn't have thought of or wouldn't have seen.

169
00:24:31.980 --> 00:24:42.990
Nathan George: So one of the questions I have is we start thinking about know what pieces might be missing are where are their areas of expertise that we want to invite in or how can we get participation from.

170
00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:48.960
Nathan George: More viewpoints that help us, you know advanced the platforms that are already here.

171
00:24:51.120 --> 00:25:01.830
Nathan George: And you know I mean particularly we've recruited pretty hard for folks who were working on secure execution environments we're working on different areas of hardware based cryptography we've recruited.

172
00:25:03.330 --> 00:25:03.990
Nathan George: pretty hard.

173
00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:11.010
Nathan George: For folks who would participate in various of special interest groups that were use case specific.

174
00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:25.770
Nathan George: Those haven't always translated into features for the core platforms that people have been building I think those sorts of participants helped make the project overall stronger, so I don't know how we go about maybe brainstorming.

175
00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:29.790
Nathan George: different facets of what we're looking for.

176
00:25:35.340 --> 00:25:35.880
Danno Ferrin: grace.

177
00:25:38.070 --> 00:25:42.810
Grace Hartley: Just wanting to jimin obviously going to be surprised when I agree with.

178
00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:50.340
Grace Hartley: What Jim was saying about integration Republic change we have priorities, I think we should be really specific, though, about whose needs we're trying to meet here.

179
00:25:50.910 --> 00:25:57.990
Grace Hartley: I think you know Tracy raise a good point that you're going to spend watching for business kind of for a while, but.

180
00:25:58.350 --> 00:26:04.260
Grace Hartley: What does business mean what what what is an enterprise, who are targeted users, because I feel like.

181
00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:13.080
Grace Hartley: You know that you know one type of enterprise will have very different needs another type of enterprise, so you know just to philosophy.

182
00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:20.730
Grace Hartley: philosophical question and I don't have a good answer at this point, but just want to make sure when we're we're thinking about what we're you're trying to attract or what.

183
00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:28.710
Grace Hartley: What is our you know gap analysis, you know let's be sure we know it's meeting you know the audience or the user, that we want.

184
00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:31.260
Grace Hartley: and

185
00:26:32.580 --> 00:26:33.690
Danno Ferrin: i'm part.

186
00:26:34.830 --> 00:26:39.870
Hart Montgomery: awesome yeah so thank you to jevon grace for the the comments.

187
00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:47.010
Hart Montgomery: And I just wanted to hear what you all thought exactly was meant by integration with the public chain.

188
00:26:47.730 --> 00:27:02.910
Hart Montgomery: You know integration is one of those things like web three that you know means a lot of different things to a lot of different people, so I just be curious if you if you if both Jim and grace could elaborate a little bit more on what they meant by that.

189
00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:08.820
Danno Ferrin: yeah.

190
00:27:10.650 --> 00:27:15.030
Jim Zhang: yeah sure I can give some of my.

191
00:27:17.130 --> 00:27:18.510
Jim Zhang: Opinions so.

192
00:27:20.010 --> 00:27:25.740
Jim Zhang: To me, when a we have a lot of customers that are building.

193
00:27:27.660 --> 00:27:34.770
Jim Zhang: sort of permission chain based defy scenarios, you know it can be.

194
00:27:38.730 --> 00:27:43.560
Jim Zhang: Writing smart contracts for a financial instrument right.

195
00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:55.560
Jim Zhang: Using or using fraction fraction is ownership to represent some real estate, for example, that's all died in the side chain.

196
00:27:57.480 --> 00:28:02.790
Jim Zhang: Once that's become successful they want to engage the general public.

197
00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:09.990
Jim Zhang: to open this up to more to a much wider audience and the best way to do that is.

198
00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:26.490
Jim Zhang: allowing people to deposit their public tokens you know curious or you know any of the tokens that runs on interior as an example salon or other side chain other layer one public chains.

199
00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:38.070
Jim Zhang: And then exchange for the tokens inside the permission side chain, and they can so they can participate in the investment opportunities they built in the side chain.

200
00:28:38.880 --> 00:29:01.710
Jim Zhang: And then, once they've guidance and policies, you know they want to withdraw so they can you know realize their their games, they will withdraw and then they exchange back to the cryptocurrency and now they they they have more money going out than coming in, so that's that's a.

201
00:29:03.030 --> 00:29:04.260
Jim Zhang: Pretty.

202
00:29:05.940 --> 00:29:23.430
Jim Zhang: Popular pattern, we have been seeing with enterprise customers sort of growing up and then realizing they they they they have this great technique or architecture to use so they can engage.

203
00:29:24.450 --> 00:29:26.070
Jim Zhang: A huge amount of.

204
00:29:27.330 --> 00:29:34.170
Jim Zhang: Public that holds cryptocurrency so that's kind of the main pattern that I had in my mind.

205
00:29:35.370 --> 00:29:36.750
Jim Zhang: hope that helps or.

206
00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:40.650
Hart Montgomery: It does thanks for the good explanation.

207
00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:50.910
Grace Hartley: Just to jump in I.

208
00:29:50.940 --> 00:29:53.310
Grace Hartley: just wanted to ECHO sorry.

209
00:29:54.240 --> 00:30:02.550
Grace Hartley: Chris no just wanted to echo that Jim was good, I was thinking, I think the technology inside chances major pieces.

210
00:30:08.010 --> 00:30:08.670
Danno Ferrin: Are.

211
00:30:10.620 --> 00:30:18.930
Artem Barger: yeah so I just wanted to race and other points or whatever good bike to sink in the world for start standardizing the.

212
00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:27.120
Artem Barger: was a you know the protocols that the structure and the things that we are doing, you know before speed we drink a lot of.

213
00:30:27.450 --> 00:30:33.540
Artem Barger: respect to crypto I mean the group cryptographic protocol, for example, hyper ledger also.

214
00:30:33.990 --> 00:30:46.290
Artem Barger: There are in the city in the blockchain projects like fabric south to aeroplane etc, and it seems like you know we have a pretty strong a big route and very good song communicate.

215
00:30:46.740 --> 00:31:00.060
Artem Barger: And so I just wondering why he really not not wondering just you know, trying to propose a whenever we would like to consider thinking towards the starting to standardize out of the protocols that we are developing, so you know.

216
00:31:01.350 --> 00:31:03.450
Artem Barger: When I would make sense to include this.

217
00:31:08.610 --> 00:31:08.820
In.

218
00:31:10.710 --> 00:31:12.090
Danno Ferrin: The back to the question I proposed.

219
00:31:12.090 --> 00:31:15.390
Danno Ferrin: Before we went down the last of experts in the.

220
00:31:15.450 --> 00:31:28.020
Danno Ferrin: Various parts ecosystem, one question before we move on in areas that I don't think I got a good answer for this is the only use case because that's I know there's been worked on on pattern for supply chain stuff.

221
00:31:29.850 --> 00:31:42.540
Danno Ferrin: And there's like some energy projects that we have in laps I wanted to know what people's thoughts were is finance the only use case that blockchain for business should be addressing, are there any other use cases.

222
00:31:43.020 --> 00:31:48.960
Danno Ferrin: That might be, you know useful maybe that's a nice bridge into the project areas Karen.

223
00:31:52.020 --> 00:31:54.150
Danno Ferrin: karen's hammer down on agent.

224
00:31:55.530 --> 00:32:00.630
Nathan George: Well, I say that the digital identity folks do a lot more things than just fintech.

225
00:32:01.860 --> 00:32:03.480
Nathan George: So the certainly there's.

226
00:32:04.590 --> 00:32:12.090
Nathan George: A lot of different areas of interest, there we could probably just make a list of the cigs that are active and have a fairly good.

227
00:32:14.070 --> 00:32:16.710
Nathan George: set of participants outside of just fintech.

228
00:32:20.340 --> 00:32:20.700
Danno Ferrin: hey.

229
00:32:21.810 --> 00:32:25.680
Dave Enyeart: I was gonna second your comment about supply chain, I think that is a first class use case.

230
00:32:34.500 --> 00:32:35.760
Danno Ferrin: where's the list of things.

231
00:32:38.430 --> 00:32:39.270
Danno Ferrin: And it's not very.

232
00:32:43.230 --> 00:32:44.970
Danno Ferrin: real question is, what are the active six.

233
00:32:46.410 --> 00:32:51.090
Danno Ferrin: Are the nine listed on the hyper ledger website representative.

234
00:32:58.230 --> 00:33:01.020
Daniela Barbosa: Here in the front of the wiki page anything that's.

235
00:33:02.490 --> 00:33:06.270
Aruna S M: Like is there have been mergers to some of those six right recent times.

236
00:33:06.510 --> 00:33:10.260
Daniela Barbosa: there's eight now because supply chain and trade finance got merged.

237
00:33:14.010 --> 00:33:14.610
Daniela Barbosa: groups.

238
00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:28.890
Danno Ferrin: Mid market CAP climate action capital market governance risk and compliance healthcare media entertainment public sector supply chain Telecom.

239
00:33:35.220 --> 00:33:35.640
Danno Ferrin: Okay.

240
00:33:37.110 --> 00:33:45.840
Danno Ferrin: As soon as agencies is probably one of the things we should focus on and making sure that we have projects that might interest them so maybe we should add that to.

241
00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:49.710
Danno Ferrin: solicit the six as well.

242
00:33:51.450 --> 00:33:55.770
Danno Ferrin: Have any closing remarks on the philosophy before we pivot over to project areas.

243
00:33:58.830 --> 00:34:03.000
Dave Enyeart: I think another basic one is focus on frameworks, rather than applications.

244
00:34:11.160 --> 00:34:11.700
Excellent.

245
00:34:13.260 --> 00:34:13.740
Danno Ferrin: Good one, I think.

246
00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:15.270
Go ahead.

247
00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:27.540
Aruna S M: are probably a comment right so last year we worked on reigniting the Charter for hyper ledger and we introduced a term called multi party systems and should be.

248
00:34:29.220 --> 00:34:38.310
Aruna S M: And I don't think so, we have been very actively seeking for projects in these areas and we probably need to look for what this means.

249
00:34:39.900 --> 00:34:40.260
Aruna S M: and

250
00:34:42.030 --> 00:34:46.380
Aruna S M: So, to me, I don't know when I think of multiparty systems, it comes as.

251
00:34:47.430 --> 00:34:54.180
Aruna S M: What would enable for somebody to build a system that would allow them to interact with their partners or their business partners right.

252
00:34:54.960 --> 00:35:14.130
Aruna S M: It could go into the way of like implementing some data standards or having specific solving I mean having build a probe a framework which would solve a specific scenario or with specify which puts on a specific domain area of problem statement.

253
00:35:27.510 --> 00:35:30.660
Danno Ferrin: Positive stuff and synthesize for our meeting on the 19th.

254
00:35:32.670 --> 00:35:44.460
Danno Ferrin: Great so let's uh with what we brainstorm so far with the philosophy without formalizing and synthesizing it baby can start just listing our product areas that we might want.

255
00:35:45.810 --> 00:35:52.200
Danno Ferrin: doesn't have to be within the philosophy, or it can be well within the philosophy, but let's just start listing them and see see what the direction gets from that.

256
00:35:57.360 --> 00:35:58.350
Danno Ferrin: Well, once.

257
00:35:59.580 --> 00:36:03.810
Danno Ferrin: There is what you can hyper ledger What would you want it to be that we're not we don't have right now.

258
00:36:04.950 --> 00:36:06.960
Danno Ferrin: everyone's got to have that idea in their head What would it be.

259
00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:13.230
Aruna S M: Really.

260
00:36:15.690 --> 00:36:24.960
Aruna S M: Just randomly thinking so at least one of the problems that we end up building in most of our solutions as a way to trace what's happening on a blockchain network across.

261
00:36:26.220 --> 00:36:27.330
Aruna S M: The entire network.

262
00:36:35.160 --> 00:36:36.690
Danno Ferrin: What are some of these new trace.

263
00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:43.980
Aruna S M: it's subjective and.

264
00:36:45.930 --> 00:36:51.360
Aruna S M: i'll be defined the traces pretty much subject to let me see if I can define it generically.

265
00:36:55.290 --> 00:36:57.480
Danno Ferrin: characteristics of what you've had to build in a trace.

266
00:37:01.020 --> 00:37:02.010
Danno Ferrin: We can define it later.

267
00:37:02.820 --> 00:37:04.200
Aruna S M: yeah take some time to think.

268
00:37:04.590 --> 00:37:04.950
Okay.

269
00:37:05.970 --> 00:37:06.450
Aruna S M: Tracy.

270
00:37:07.590 --> 00:37:14.880
Tracy Kuhrt: I think the tooling around our different sites in layer one or one guilty right.

271
00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:25.710
Tracy Kuhrt: I think you know talking through tracing it to me what that brings up is you know expanding the ability to monitor and.

272
00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:40.530
Tracy Kuhrt: We you know we're already doing some automation with the devil, but just continuing to build that out for all of our projects, not just for a single one right so having those kind of cross project.

273
00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:44.790
Tracy Kuhrt: tools for.

274
00:37:45.810 --> 00:37:47.490
Tracy Kuhrt: For monitoring guesses were not.

275
00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:53.040
Danno Ferrin: Monitoring automation.

276
00:37:57.660 --> 00:37:59.430
Danno Ferrin: Deployment I know available does that.

277
00:38:01.290 --> 00:38:09.930
Danno Ferrin: That we can list what we're currently covering to to try and get a feel for what what our plate should look like you know what are the, what are the what's the full pyramid for blockchain.

278
00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:10.800
sure.

279
00:38:12.090 --> 00:38:12.630
Danno Ferrin: Jim.

280
00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:28.410
Jim Zhang: I think we can really do with a standard collection of token implementations it's such a useful constructs both functional and non functional I know the fabric team have.

281
00:38:30.150 --> 00:38:33.480
Jim Zhang: I think at least one maybe more laps.

282
00:38:35.220 --> 00:38:52.950
Jim Zhang: But just feel like we can we can have more prominent implementations like English during World opens up and there's a no brainer go to for high quality dictation for these things, something like this would really help many customers who end up writing.

283
00:38:54.690 --> 00:38:59.010
Jim Zhang: Something themselves if it's it's a if it's on fabric.

284
00:39:00.330 --> 00:39:03.720
Jim Zhang: or one of the other deities that are not based.

285
00:39:06.540 --> 00:39:18.570
Danno Ferrin: yeah that I think about ethereum is your only really got well I guess you can have some of the other aspects of it, but you only got the best for fundable, and non fundable any of the other interesting token taxonomy this.

286
00:39:19.740 --> 00:39:22.410
Danno Ferrin: present moment does have some, but not all.

287
00:39:23.580 --> 00:39:24.090
Jim Zhang: Good.

288
00:39:25.560 --> 00:39:26.040
Danno Ferrin: cool.

289
00:39:26.850 --> 00:39:27.360
heart.

290
00:39:28.890 --> 00:39:30.480
Hart Montgomery: i'm gonna dream really big here.

291
00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:32.220
Hart Montgomery: i'd love to see a.

292
00:39:32.430 --> 00:39:35.400
Hart Montgomery: common consensus interface.

293
00:39:36.930 --> 00:39:41.580
Hart Montgomery: And you know implementation of modular consensus algorithms.

294
00:39:49.350 --> 00:39:51.060
Danno Ferrin: big idea six defenses I like it.

295
00:39:54.330 --> 00:39:55.680
Danno Ferrin: Jim did you still have your hand up.

296
00:39:58.590 --> 00:39:59.280
Danno Ferrin: Okay Nathan.

297
00:40:00.870 --> 00:40:12.360
Nathan George: i'm in the digital identity say we've always thought about self organizing name spaces and can we make it so that possessing some verifiable information qualifies you to share state or process state.

298
00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:23.940
Nathan George: In a in a shared namespace so instead of thinking about the system is side chains think it think about it more as more more like global storage so there's some interesting ideas to explore there, I think.

299
00:40:42.120 --> 00:40:45.060
Danno Ferrin: Any other big audacious goals.

300
00:40:46.650 --> 00:40:51.000
Danno Ferrin: These have to be accomplished in three months is gonna be like, for your projects we can start.

301
00:41:02.910 --> 00:41:06.150
Nathan George: A project that we talked about kind of it.

302
00:41:07.320 --> 00:41:12.570
Nathan George: Is can we use blockchain to make decentralized development more self organizing.

303
00:41:20.730 --> 00:41:21.120
Danno Ferrin: Okay.

304
00:41:30.300 --> 00:41:30.630
Danno Ferrin: heart.

305
00:41:31.590 --> 00:41:34.680
Hart Montgomery: If it is this the reinvent github is blockchain.

306
00:41:34.890 --> 00:41:35.280
Item.

307
00:41:36.570 --> 00:41:52.350
Nathan George: In a different packaging yeah because I think it's taken a couple of tracks that did we were very much but there's a bunch of paths that you know were discussed on the after hours conference track, so to speak, that we haven't tried yet.

308
00:41:53.730 --> 00:41:54.600
Hart Montgomery: gotcha right.

309
00:41:55.380 --> 00:42:02.940
Danno Ferrin: And I think I haven't been almost after I was conference tracks, but it makes me wonder if things like data availability or, like some of the big issues that would.

310
00:42:03.300 --> 00:42:06.030
Danno Ferrin: be presented there because you got more than terabytes of data.

311
00:42:06.510 --> 00:42:10.650
Danno Ferrin: you've got you know approaching an x divided data on some of that how would we share that.

312
00:42:12.360 --> 00:42:12.930
Danno Ferrin: Are some.

313
00:42:22.560 --> 00:42:23.190
Danno Ferrin: Still muted.

314
00:42:23.970 --> 00:42:32.460
Artem Barger: yeah I think I think that the music music a professional use case from the list a decentralized digital identity.

315
00:42:37.980 --> 00:42:38.640
Artem Barger: Have you here.

316
00:42:40.650 --> 00:42:41.280
Artem Barger: So let me see.

317
00:42:49.740 --> 00:42:51.840
Danno Ferrin: What projects might help a decentralized digital its.

318
00:42:52.020 --> 00:42:58.710
Danno Ferrin: identity that aren't well, even if they are here what what's the scope what's the what's the food pyramid look like for a decentralized digital identity.

319
00:42:59.610 --> 00:43:09.180
Nathan George: Well there's a lot of pieces of what trust over IP is defined as the decentralized digital identity stack that are already here we don't do as much on the.

320
00:43:10.200 --> 00:43:11.970
Nathan George: edge agents, or the.

321
00:43:14.040 --> 00:43:22.980
Nathan George: Well, we would call the individuals identity wallet and hyper ledger as we might want, we also don't do as much work on.

322
00:43:24.390 --> 00:43:36.930
Nathan George: Peer to peer cryptography cryptography based api's that the areas protocol work kind of has pushed a lot of interesting constructs around how you can do.

323
00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:49.560
Nathan George: You know peer to peer digital information sharing and how you can do dynamically Compostable api's through that sort of infrastructure and there's probably more we could both investigate and share, about what's been going on in that area.

324
00:43:52.770 --> 00:43:53.190
Danno Ferrin: Okay.

325
00:43:54.060 --> 00:43:54.540
Tracy.

326
00:43:56.280 --> 00:43:57.480
Tracy Kuhrt: Enterprise wallet.

327
00:43:59.640 --> 00:44:00.540
Tracy Kuhrt: For any type of.

328
00:44:01.590 --> 00:44:05.700
Tracy Kuhrt: Asset he then verifiable credentials or.

329
00:44:07.140 --> 00:44:07.710
Tracy Kuhrt: tokens.

330
00:44:28.320 --> 00:44:31.080
Jim Zhang: yeah I guess just can I go.

331
00:44:33.210 --> 00:44:46.920
Jim Zhang: yeah it's just add to that the idea of enterprise wallets mpc based wallet I think it's kind of these days is the most for custody typos scenarios.

332
00:44:48.390 --> 00:44:49.080
Danno Ferrin: MTC.

333
00:44:49.590 --> 00:44:52.110
Jim Zhang: yeah multiparty confused.

334
00:44:57.090 --> 00:45:02.190
Danno Ferrin: Okay that's a little weird on my headphones just like non player characters know multi party confused.

335
00:45:04.470 --> 00:45:04.950
Danno Ferrin: thinking.

336
00:45:06.030 --> 00:45:18.000
Nathan George: there's probably a whole class of enterprise tools integration issues that we should have on our docket for projects, whether it's integrating into conventional authentication systems, integrating into you know.

337
00:45:18.570 --> 00:45:28.470
Nathan George: Business objects system was or you know all those sorts of things that we could probably make a big list of from everyone's internal architectural roadmap debates.

338
00:45:31.170 --> 00:45:31.620
Nathan George: yeah.

339
00:45:31.740 --> 00:45:33.090
Danno Ferrin: um let's.

340
00:45:33.240 --> 00:45:33.840
see a.

341
00:45:36.090 --> 00:45:37.650
Danno Ferrin: track little transform.

342
00:46:02.670 --> 00:46:03.540
Jim Zhang: cto.

343
00:46:09.030 --> 00:46:11.460
Danno Ferrin: He led me to there's there's both approaches to.

344
00:46:13.290 --> 00:46:18.660
Danno Ferrin: Extreme where did you transform before after so people get excited about doing it before so after.

345
00:46:40.050 --> 00:46:41.670
Danno Ferrin: Okay, so.

346
00:46:42.780 --> 00:46:55.560
Danno Ferrin: looks like we got a good list here, so I think that the next step for this this task force um we could go on for 12 more minutes brainstorming, but I think we've reached a critical mass of some of these ideas so on the.

347
00:46:56.790 --> 00:46:58.830
Danno Ferrin: On the 19th I think we need to.

348
00:47:00.810 --> 00:47:02.820
Danno Ferrin: Try and synthesize some of the themes out of this.

349
00:47:03.840 --> 00:47:04.680
Danno Ferrin: and

350
00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:25.410
Aruna S M: I guess, we can add one more point to enterprise tools integration, most of the times, it means so happened that so when we talk about authentication.

351
00:47:26.640 --> 00:47:29.280
Aruna S M: We eventually need to deal with the blockchain.

352
00:47:30.300 --> 00:47:43.140
Aruna S M: blockchain layer itself right and let's say somebody is working on multiple protocols, they may need to deal with different types of key management that each blockchain has to go through and.

353
00:47:44.460 --> 00:47:57.330
Aruna S M: Since hyper ledger most of the frameworks, but does provide a permission in feature, and it would be nice to have a common common integration point for that as well.

354
00:48:42.660 --> 00:48:44.580
Danno Ferrin: Any other last minute adds.

355
00:48:50.880 --> 00:48:54.780
Tracy Kuhrt: Just a question when you say active projects flow you mean graduated project.

356
00:48:56.430 --> 00:48:57.540
you're right like you.

357
00:48:59.250 --> 00:49:11.310
Tracy Kuhrt: You use the word active earlier and the way it the way you said it, I wasn't quite sure whether you meant, you know people were contributing to it actively or if you make graduated so just just wanted to verify.

358
00:49:12.120 --> 00:49:12.780
Danno Ferrin: So.

359
00:49:12.840 --> 00:49:13.830
I mean all of them actually.

360
00:49:15.330 --> 00:49:27.330
Danno Ferrin: Because the activity of a project by give insight as to maybe they're close, but just a little bit off so maybe we need to restart that project or we need to restart it slightly different charter so that might be worth looking into.

361
00:49:31.080 --> 00:49:37.800
Nathan George: I think there's also cases where some of these items probably are covered by the projects that we haven't publicized what's going on there very well.

362
00:49:47.400 --> 00:49:53.190
Danno Ferrin: yeah because I think I said very insightful because it might not be that we don't have a gap is that we don't know that we have something to fill that gap.

363
00:50:03.480 --> 00:50:15.270
Danno Ferrin: cool so encourage everyone to read over this does want to participate in formulating the philosophy and the areas and help identify the gaps feel free to contribute to this page edit leave comments.

364
00:50:16.590 --> 00:50:24.630
Danno Ferrin: And from this world in two weeks time we'll come back and we'll try and synthesize the themes, so when we come back against the CSC.

365
00:50:25.050 --> 00:50:38.220
Danno Ferrin: We can discuss the themes, make sure it lines up and then started identifying where these products line up with the gaps really are and what we would want to fill those gaps, I think, is going to come back in four weeks time in two weeks time bathroom synthesize that.

366
00:50:39.270 --> 00:50:49.680
Danno Ferrin: sort of courage everyone, I will send the when I get the invite out later today i've got a last thursday's My big meeting day so it's going to be a while, before I can set up the the invite sent it out when I send it out, you know.

367
00:50:51.180 --> 00:50:58.320
Danno Ferrin: Please, please attend the meeting, if you want to help synthesize and then categorize these these brainstorming items.

368
00:51:01.980 --> 00:51:07.110
Danno Ferrin: That will be up for the day well make good use of the extra time thanks for keeping the agenda light.

369
00:51:12.570 --> 00:51:13.620
Jim Zhang: It thanks guys.

370
00:51:14.910 --> 00:51:15.510
Sean Bohan (Hyperledger): Thanks a lot.

371
00:51:15.600 --> 00:51:15.780
Thanks.
