1
00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:18.810
Tracy Kuhrt: Welcome everyone to the April 14 hyper ledger technical steering committee call, as you are all aware.

2
00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:30.210
Tracy Kuhrt: Two things we must abide by on this call the first is the antitrust policy notice that is currently displayed on the screen and the second is our code of conduct, which is linked in the agenda.

3
00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:40.950
Tracy Kuhrt: So standard announcements that we have the first one to get weekly developer newsletter goes out each Friday, if you have anything that you would like to see added to that.

4
00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:59.700
Tracy Kuhrt: Please add a comment on the wiki page and then the second announcement is that the hyper ledger global forum is still accepting CFP until April 29th so just about two weeks away now, and if you have anything that you would like to.

5
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:14.040
Tracy Kuhrt: Talk about at the hyper ledger call before and Please submit your CFP and then also, I believe, a heart is still correct at the program committee volunteers still open for people to volunteer.

6
00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:29.040
Hart Montgomery: Absolutely Tracy if you're interested, please feel free to reach out and we are also still reaching out to people, we have a number of people who have already said yes, so thank you very much, if that's if you're one of those people.

7
00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.510
Hart Montgomery: And if not we'd love to hear from you so thanks a lot.

8
00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:35.610
Tracy Kuhrt: All right, great.

9
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.250
Tracy Kuhrt: Any other announcements if anybody would like to make.

10
00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:43.590
Ry Jones: I think Daniela has a minor announcement.

11
00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:47.520
Ry Jones: she's muted.

12
00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.830
Daniela Barbosa: Which is that.

13
00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.230
Ry Jones: The forum for our.

14
00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.120
Ry Jones: event in Dublin.

15
00:01:54.480 --> 00:02:10.410
Daniela Barbosa: Oh, oh okay yeah, so we will be having our hyper ledger evening event at the Guinness storehouse, which is the premier place for for activities in Dublin so cheers to us all and we'll see you there.

16
00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:16.170
Tracy Kuhrt: Thanks Daniela.

17
00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.620
Tracy Kuhrt: Any other announcements that anybody would like to thank.

18
00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.810
Tracy Kuhrt: Okay, see no hands and nobody coming off mute I take that as a no.

19
00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:50.700
Tracy Kuhrt: So we got in the hyper ledger cactus quarterly report that is due, today, I know that some of you have already had a chance to look at it, if you haven't yet had a chance to look at, please do so, I think the there was one question that I asked in Peter took care of that, so I think.

20
00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.000
Tracy Kuhrt: Unless anybody has any questions right now.

21
00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:01.380
Tracy Kuhrt: that's probably it for the reports, but does anybody have any questions on the cactus report.

22
00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:21.270
Tracy Kuhrt: Okay, so no questions there so Dave did, let us know that he'd be putting the fabric report together, so we should be seeing that one coming shortly as well, so as you're.

23
00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:28.650
Tracy Kuhrt: Thinking about reviewing the cactus one if you haven't already please also take a look and see if the fabric, one is available.

24
00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:35.940
Tracy Kuhrt: So we don't have any quarterly reports that are due next week, the next one that's do is hyper ledger sawtooth.

25
00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:49.860
Tracy Kuhrt: And as far as I know we don't have any specific tlc business to discuss, but if, so please speak up now, we can talk about anything that people would like to talk to you see business wise.

26
00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:00.090
Tracy Kuhrt: Okay, so.

27
00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:11.130
Tracy Kuhrt: Then I guess I know it's up to you to take us through the work that you've done for us already on the TC responsibilities.

28
00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:13.770
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): Right, thank you.

29
00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:21.000
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): kitty well today ship is can override do you want to click on the link you had in front of you.

30
00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:23.820
Ry Jones: sure I will I didn't know if you're going to like.

31
00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.990
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): Speak doesn't really matter to either either way works.

32
00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:37.530
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): So I mean for everybody, you can just click on the files changed and there's only one so.

33
00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:41.520
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): So, as you know, this is about.

34
00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:50.760
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): adding a page that disk that describes the responsibility of Jesse members and so.

35
00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:57.390
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): I figured we didn't really need a task force because I don't know that there is much discussion needed.

36
00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:11.280
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): I figured the most effective way forward was to actually put the PR together, and so this PR is the one we're seeing now and it basically adds one page to the.

37
00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:23.490
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): To the tasc space, which would be rendered on the tlc website and I this page basically starts listing the.

38
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:30.120
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): The role of the tasc that comes from the Charter so that's something that we have to accept.

39
00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:39.810
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): If we disagreed with any of this, we would have to go back to the Governing Board to revise the Charter but I don't think any of this is controversial.

40
00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:49.440
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): At least his name, nobody has ever raised in the objections to this, so instead you know I think the more interesting part is the next sections.

41
00:05:49.800 --> 00:06:09.090
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): which you know, is something that is not listed in the Charter, but that, based on my experience with now many years as a tlc members and then, as well as Chair I figured it would be good to least several things that I think are expected of us and.

42
00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:18.900
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): And so I I got feedback from Tracy that I incorporated so, can you scroll down a little bit.

43
00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:29.820
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): yeah So this is the most important part right, so we can look quickly to see Members like a it's pretty straightforward, you have to spit in tlc meetings.

44
00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:33.870
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): review the tlc project updates which we just did.

45
00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:49.800
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): bring up and help resolve any issues related to the need of the Community and participate in an option on your chair the task forces, set up by the tlc that's the kind of stuff we do and.

46
00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:59.550
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): Then one project meeting a month, so you know you see because somebody said, do we really want to have this in there and I think it was a road but.

47
00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:10.890
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): It doesn't matter the I felt like yes, I mean this is a decision we've made we said we would do this and I figured well, we should just list that.

48
00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:23.040
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): And you know we're not the police not tracking what people are actually doing it doesn't really that's not the point I think the point is really to set the expectation.

49
00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:31.470
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): So that, in particular when we do the tsa election every year, you know people can have a look, we can point to this and say.

50
00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:51.090
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): hey you want to nominate yourself of the nominate and you've been nominated by somebody to run on the tsa election, this is what the same tales and then I described the tasc chair role, which you know there's this kind of funny story, I mean it was funny for me.

51
00:07:52.290 --> 00:08:11.970
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): Tracy didn't think it was so funny but you know after she got elected I had a chat with her and I started listing all the things that just brains, you know it was kind of a brain dump all the things that I was doing as chair and they were a lot of things that she.

52
00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:18.210
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): kind of laughed and say oh gee nobody knew about all of these things before.

53
00:08:20.010 --> 00:08:30.300
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): and thankfully I don't think she would not have written, for that matter, but I think it's, it is true that you know some of these things, not necessarily completely obvious.

54
00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:36.090
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): And again, I think it's good to set an expectation, so that if people are interested in running for chair.

55
00:08:36.930 --> 00:08:45.690
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): They should know what it entails and there's The thing that of course everybody knows about you know the running those tlc to calls typically.

56
00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:55.020
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): But you know you may also have realized that tlc always gives an update at the global forum, as well as the Member summit, you may be aware that.

57
00:08:55.440 --> 00:09:08.670
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): That tasc chair is also the Governing Board, which, as a few meetings and during those meetings we are invited us chair to give an update on what's going on in the tasc so to be clear, you can ever.

58
00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:24.270
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): I used to have only one slide and you can have a couple of slides but you're like 1015 minutes to give an update on what's going on and then there's also the last bullet, which I think was the most surprising, the the two to.

59
00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:40.770
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): Tracy is you know, the fact that we are also in contact with the staff who you know will reach out to the chair when they have inquiries from external parties, it can be the press, it can be some analysis to want to know.

60
00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:55.200
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): bit more on the technical side what's going on and typically this can be a collaboration between the staff and the Chair as to how to respond to these inquiries, but this is, you know something that.

61
00:09:56.070 --> 00:10:10.080
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): chairs, you know do, and so, then we added a section, and I think Tracy for bringing that one up i'd forgotten, but we added the small section on the vice chair she's the vice chair.

62
00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:19.920
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): explaining what the when the primary responsibilities are which you, as you know, is to run the test meeting and the Chair is not available.

63
00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:27.930
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): but also to help, so I think this is something Tracy you put in place, I didn't really do that, I think, but.

64
00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:38.700
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): reaching out to projects when they miss submitting to see quality project updates when they're missing, but so this is kind of you know.

65
00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:53.580
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): I, I hope, none of this is a is controversial now, is there any questions about this, because then there's a couple of questions that came up in the comments that I think we should discuss especially one.

66
00:10:57.630 --> 00:11:04.920
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): So I don't see anybody raising their hands or anything so I assume this is non controversial I would expect that to be honest, but.

67
00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:15.600
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): So now, if we go back right to the to the page the chorus conversation page, we can look at the comments.

68
00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:23.190
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): So there was this issue about you know attending meetings a room saying, do we really need this.

69
00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:31.440
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): So you guys can decide, you know if you disagree with it the status quo and cnet and.

70
00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:40.110
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): A room does not further responded and, if you want to do that now room, are you okay with keeping it go ahead.

71
00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:52.350
Aruna S M: Oh, I mean I intentionally did not respond because I did not know what else to respond i'm fine with the explanation, so far, probably should have just said okay.

72
00:11:54.570 --> 00:11:57.780
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): that's fine, we can call that result and.

73
00:11:58.200 --> 00:11:59.820
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): And then the the other one.

74
00:12:00.210 --> 00:12:17.970
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): Is a rune suggested we add something about the responsibility for Chelsea members to act as two words or ambassador for the hyper ledger foundation, I actually think it's it's a good idea, this is definitely something I have been doing.

75
00:12:19.710 --> 00:12:26.640
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): And not just when I was a chair, I mean, in general I you know I bought spinning many conferences.

76
00:12:26.910 --> 00:12:37.170
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): And I were talking about hyper ledger I often talk about I played your fabric next but I always give an introduction about hyper ledger where I explain a bit, but the different projects and so on.

77
00:12:37.650 --> 00:12:43.350
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): And i've been involved in the European blockchain forum for instance and.

78
00:12:43.890 --> 00:12:51.780
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): i'm a member of the expert group there, and you know, one of the things that i've been doing there for several years now.

79
00:12:52.080 --> 00:13:02.460
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): he's talking about what we do an iPad ager to make sure that they are aware and they don't reinvent the world or you know that they they know about this what's what we are doing here.

80
00:13:03.270 --> 00:13:14.940
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): And so I think it's quite appropriate to bring that up, but at the same time, this I realized this is not, this is something everybody feels like they they want to sign up for so.

81
00:13:16.290 --> 00:13:27.240
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): I didn't really want to just add it because, for me, it was not as obvious as the rest and I said we should discuss this, and so, in my opinion, we are free, are we are basically.

82
00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:42.330
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): three options is one we say we don't add this at all the other is we add it as a most this is what's expected or it's like you know, an optional kind of activity that people made.

83
00:13:44.970 --> 00:13:46.680
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): So right, you have your hand up.

84
00:13:47.130 --> 00:13:47.970
Ry Jones: Sure, I.

85
00:13:49.290 --> 00:14:02.610
Ry Jones: I the page is on responsibilities and personally I would feel uncomfortable you know telling people that it's your responsibility to be out there front and Center because, as you know that some people are are not comfortable doing that.

86
00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:19.410
Ry Jones: But I think I raised my hand before you offered the third option, which I think would be the way to do it as not a responsibility, but I would phrase it more as an opportunity.

87
00:14:20.970 --> 00:14:29.550
Ry Jones: For people who want to you know get out there and and talk in public and that's how I would go.

88
00:14:30.750 --> 00:14:31.200
Ry Jones: Tracy.

89
00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:42.030
Tracy Kuhrt: yeah so I I don't I think there are many ways that you can act as an ambassador or steward and I don't think it has to involve.

90
00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:53.400
Tracy Kuhrt: Speaking in front of an audience of hundreds right, I think it could be answering a question on the chat channels, if you know the answer to it, I think it could be.

91
00:14:54.750 --> 00:15:06.060
Tracy Kuhrt: You know, helping somebody get involved in contributing to the project that you're participating in or the working group or the task force right just being welcoming to people in the Community is.

92
00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:24.660
Tracy Kuhrt: acting as an ambassador or steward for hyper ledger right, and so I just want to make sure that we don't conflate the two of speaking at conferences with being an ambassador, and I, I think that being an ambassador Stewart is definitely um you know something that I would.

93
00:15:24.870 --> 00:15:25.920
Tracy Kuhrt: have them adding.

94
00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:32.250
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): But, so what you're saying is if we added, we have to.

95
00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:36.990
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): Be careful I mean to kind of specify what they sent out.

96
00:15:37.590 --> 00:15:39.480
Tracy Kuhrt: yeah yeah yeah well.

97
00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:46.170
Tracy Kuhrt: I think you could, I think you could add it as being an ambassador steward of the hyper ledger foundation.

98
00:15:47.190 --> 00:15:55.020
Tracy Kuhrt: and provide examples of ways that you might do that, instead of saying this is the only way that you can act as an investor sure yeah.

99
00:15:55.980 --> 00:15:58.230
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): I meant yes okay sounds good.

100
00:15:59.250 --> 00:16:00.150
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): Nathan.

101
00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:12.060
Nathan George: Well, and I think it's we're not trying to be prescriptive what someone has to do with this statement so much as setting expectations, and I think it is a good thing to tell potential.

102
00:16:12.090 --> 00:16:20.340
Nathan George: tasc members David or Sean might reach out to you and say hey there's a panel at this conference, are you interested or Can you help with this webinar.

103
00:16:21.270 --> 00:16:32.520
Nathan George: And I think most of the maintainer who would run for the tasc kind of already expect that because they've seen tasc Members do those sorts of things or they've participated in that that kind of thing themselves it's just it's a good thing to have on the list.

104
00:16:35.310 --> 00:16:48.990
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): Alright, so I hear, for now, that people express themselves in to be in favor of hiding something and being careful about you know how we weren't what this entails, but.

105
00:16:50.370 --> 00:16:52.530
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): Any other opinions or hot.

106
00:16:54.330 --> 00:17:01.140
Hart Montgomery: yeah I agree, I mean I think it's not unreasonable to ask tlc members to sort of pitch in and help out with.

107
00:17:01.650 --> 00:17:03.480
Hart Montgomery: You know, some things but certainly.

108
00:17:04.170 --> 00:17:13.650
Hart Montgomery: How that occurs should be open to them, you know Ryan, others are absolutely right that not everybody wants to go in front of you know.

109
00:17:14.970 --> 00:17:22.620
Hart Montgomery: Huge numbers of people at conferences or things like that, but there are lots of other ways to be a Community steward as Tracy pointed out so.

110
00:17:23.730 --> 00:17:25.890
Hart Montgomery: I really liked how Tracy put it.

111
00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:36.600
Ry Jones: did want to point out, and I wanted to make sure that it was public before I did this is the the lf mantra right humble helpful helpful.

112
00:17:39.450 --> 00:17:42.180
Ry Jones: And that is something that.

113
00:17:43.650 --> 00:17:52.920
Ry Jones: I think encapsulates a lot of what Tracy said about answering the questions you know if you can, if you can answer or redirect someone.

114
00:17:54.840 --> 00:18:00.030
Ry Jones: You know that's that's perfect so anyway, I just wanted to share that.

115
00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:11.490
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): opinions.

116
00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:16.980
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): If not, I think you know.

117
00:18:18.750 --> 00:18:23.550
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): This is the only thing left that'd be great if you scroll down I think that's it so.

118
00:18:25.470 --> 00:18:37.830
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): If we're in agreement, well then there's a question of the table of contents and how where it fits in the page, but I don't think a biggie is worth our time discussing here kamlish good.

119
00:18:41.730 --> 00:18:42.030
Kamlesh Nagware: So.

120
00:18:43.860 --> 00:19:02.490
Kamlesh Nagware: This is regarding the point of four and five like communicating with a external industry organization concerning data technical methods and especially our point five appointing representative to work with other open source of each candle communities So what is this one.

121
00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:19.410
Kamlesh Nagware: Like what other law, the likes of or like hmm foundation is one of the open, so it could be that are like well, maybe I typically blockchains all is a different.

122
00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:24.210
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): move back up right please I think it's part of our rooms.

123
00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:28.830
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): comment right is that what you mean them lunch.

124
00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:34.650
Kamlesh Nagware: And as a data Point number four and five in the tsa responded is in the page.

125
00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:40.440
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): Okay yeah yeah yeah you mean at the beginning of the page.

126
00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:45.480
Kamlesh Nagware: Like yeah if you really look at the file change and then open the file yeah yeah.

127
00:19:46.470 --> 00:19:50.550
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): Good point, so this is the part that's from the Charter.

128
00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:51.810
Kamlesh Nagware: yeah.

129
00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:53.340
Kamlesh Nagware: Like was 45.

130
00:19:57.930 --> 00:19:59.700
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): Okay, so what is your question now.

131
00:20:00.210 --> 00:20:01.740
Kamlesh Nagware: My medicine is like.

132
00:20:02.790 --> 00:20:20.760
Kamlesh Nagware: Appointing representative to work with open source and extended Community so if if someone is part of this kind of committee committees today, they need to convey this message or or an update to the hyper ledger or what is all about.

133
00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:29.460
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): So my understanding on this is we haven't done that we have never that I know of, I think I would.

134
00:20:30.810 --> 00:20:34.830
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): But I don't think we've ever formerly appointed any representative.

135
00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:37.230
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): to work in other organizations.

136
00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:42.060
Kamlesh Nagware: Like like I still wasn't because currently this ieee blocking initiatives.

137
00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:55.410
Kamlesh Nagware: You know upon upon me is the Co chair for their some initiatives and sustainability and block chain and even I am I am kind of conducting the hyperlink box up there, so I just want to be.

138
00:20:57.090 --> 00:20:59.340
Kamlesh Nagware: Sure, like whether this is right on this is not.

139
00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:09.180
Kamlesh Nagware: Because I don't live in is all open source community and kind of, but they are not focusing any is basically locking is getting lucky.

140
00:21:10.830 --> 00:21:23.940
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): yeah so my understanding of this and again this comes from the Charter right, so my understanding and others may have a different point of view, but it is always the I mean i'm also involved with no other organizations right quite a few.

141
00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:28.980
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): And, and so clearly you're entitled to do this.

142
00:21:29.130 --> 00:21:37.770
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): And again when you're in those organizations, you can act as a steward for the hyper ledger foundation.

143
00:21:38.190 --> 00:21:56.220
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): Not only because you're a member of the tlc but just because you're involved do you can talk about what's going on, for instance, a an open ssl if i'm given feedback on you know the the visionary vulnerability disclosure guidelines, when we start looking into it and so.

144
00:21:57.330 --> 00:22:09.180
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): I think that's totally fine, I think this point is provided, because there may be situations where we actually want to a point for more representative where.

145
00:22:09.630 --> 00:22:19.170
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): say there is the activities that somewhere else, and as a community we say you know what we should have some somebody representing us there.

146
00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:31.860
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): that's my that's my take on this, but again I mean we've never really done that, and so I don't think the situation as arise so.

147
00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:48.480
Hart Montgomery: yeah That was my take on that to our notes my sort of scenarios imagine that, like you know the EA is doing, like an interrupt committee slash working group right.

148
00:22:49.260 --> 00:23:00.330
Hart Montgomery: And you know hyper ledger is officially, a member of the day, and we should have someone following it so we say okay Peter go join this committee as the hyper ledger representative.

149
00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:08.250
Hart Montgomery: So so that's what I sort of imagined this provision working as and we really haven't ever used it.

150
00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:11.190
Hart Montgomery: But there's no reason we couldn't.

151
00:23:17.070 --> 00:23:18.690
Hart Montgomery: See how theatre.

152
00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:31.140
Daniela Barbosa: In that situation that's actually not allowed if it's a formal organization, it has to be staff members now if those staff members are also.

153
00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:46.830
Daniela Barbosa: employees of companies that are members of those other organizations, then, then that they still can't be official members or representatives of hyper ledger and that's just due to most of those organizations bylaws.

154
00:23:49.770 --> 00:23:50.100
Daniela Barbosa: Just.

155
00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:51.240
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): Of course, I mean.

156
00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:59.670
Daniela Barbosa: We do not yeah we do not by joining hyper ledger foundation by joining the EA or anything else does not.

157
00:24:00.150 --> 00:24:08.070
Daniela Barbosa: provide the ability for anyone in our Community to or Members to be been members of staff just that's a little caveat.

158
00:24:08.130 --> 00:24:08.610
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): Good point.

159
00:24:08.670 --> 00:24:15.210
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): yeah that's a good point I mean, of course, this is assuming that you can the.

160
00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:17.970
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): Other organization.

161
00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:22.740
Daniela Barbosa: We should collaborate, we should certainly collaborate.

162
00:24:22.830 --> 00:24:24.060
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): Okay month so.

163
00:24:24.150 --> 00:24:27.900
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): Alright, so thanks for bringing that up I hope this clarifies it.

164
00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:39.630
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): thing this is interesting is we're never really talked too much about this is a good opportunity to do so and kind of little said everybody's expectation as to what our Charter says.

165
00:24:40.230 --> 00:25:05.460
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): But, so what I meant to say next was if we have general agreement, then what I suggest is I will update the I will update the PR accordingly and then I would really invite everybody to have a look at it and and syndicate please on the PR as you improve.

166
00:25:07.950 --> 00:25:12.120
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): Enough approvals, then we can just merge it and read up.

167
00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:19.020
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): Of course this is like everything else will be updated, later on, if we find.

168
00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:26.430
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): it's a master or.

169
00:25:29.190 --> 00:25:30.090
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): Does that sound good.

170

172
00:25:36.510 --> 00:25:40.050
