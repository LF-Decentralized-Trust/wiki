1
00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:41.610
Tracy Kuhrt: So, welcome to the April 21 hyper ledger technical steering committee call, as you are all aware, two things we missed by by the first one is the antitrust policy notice that is currently displayed on the screen and the second is our code of conduct.

2
00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.210
Tracy Kuhrt: So for our agenda today, we have our standard announcements.

3
00:00:49.410 --> 00:01:08.340
Tracy Kuhrt: A Dev weekly developer newsletter goes out each Friday if you'd like to have something added to that newsletter please leave a comment on the wiki page that is linked in our agenda, and the second announcement is the hyper ledger global forum is still accepting CFP.

4
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:22.050
Tracy Kuhrt: For just over a week more and I did see yesterday, I think it was yesterday and announcement come out that there are also an extra day of workshops that are.

5
00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:36.450
Tracy Kuhrt: open and so, if you'd like to submit CFP for a workshop leave those are now available on the CFP site as well Oh, and then the heart is the call for program committee volunteer still open.

6
00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:53.610
Hart Montgomery: So I clicking the unmute button, yes, we are looking for a couple more volunteers so, particularly if anyone on the tasc is interested in joining several people already have please feel free to reach out.

7
00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.790
Tracy Kuhrt: Any other announcements that anybody has to make today.

8
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:16.200
Tracy Kuhrt: Alright, see no Hansen, nobody coming off mute I will take that as we know, so we've got the quarterly reports I did see the.

9
00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:27.180
Tracy Kuhrt: hyper ledger fabric report come in either last night or this morning, which, but it was in my inbox this morning, so I Dave, thank you for that.

10
00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:39.660
Tracy Kuhrt: i've seen a few people have already had a chance to look at it, but we'll make sure that's kept on the agenda for next week for everybody to have the opportunity to review the fabric report.

11
00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:51.300
Tracy Kuhrt: Next week is the hyper ledger sawtooth report that's do, and of course we always have the calendar out there for people to take a look up.

12
00:02:52.290 --> 00:03:14.640
Tracy Kuhrt: So with that, I do have one item that i'd like to discuss from the T is T PC business this week around the tlc responsibilities, the issue that we reviewed last week in rtc meeting and I believe we've got about six or seven sort of check marks already in the.

13
00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:25.530
Tracy Kuhrt: In the issue itself as far as approvals I did see one change David, I think that you suggested that came in there.

14
00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:34.710
Tracy Kuhrt: just add an extra s to one of the words, but I think that's the only specific change that i've seen a request it.

15
00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:55.830
Tracy Kuhrt: was thinking, maybe we could have a vote almost to see if we would like to formally approved this in a PC meeting, but if anybody has any sort of discussion here that we should have before that, or we don't think we're ready yet now is the time is because.

16
00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:07.350
Aruna S M: I guess, there is one more item to be added Point number nine personally I did it in one of the comments I sorta.

17
00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:19.500
Tracy Kuhrt: So I think we.

18
00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.790
Aruna S M: All want.

19
00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:27.480
Tracy Kuhrt: To do we want to add implicitly the subscribing to the tasc.

20
00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:37.320
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): yeah i'm happy to do put that in with the with the S missing that Dave spotted.

21
00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:48.390
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): yeah, as I pointed out it's it does to be in the city and Lisa wouldn't be numbered nine because that's the Charter least but that's the detail.

22
00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:51.330
Tracy Kuhrt: yeah make sense.

23
00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:57.240
Tracy Kuhrt: Okay, any other comments or concerns.

24
00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:01.860
Ry Jones: So I guess I just thought of one.

25
00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:03.420
Tracy Kuhrt: In.

26
00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:04.770
Ry Jones: Along the same lines.

27
00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:09.570
Ry Jones: What about joining the github org.

28
00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:11.970
Ry Jones: Is that a requirement.

29
00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:17.820
Peter Somogyvari: I guess.

30
00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:21.810
Tracy Kuhrt: I guess if they want to be informed of the.

31
00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:30.300
Tracy Kuhrt: issues that are coming up on the tsp hyper ledger slash gc repo and that would probably be a requirement as well.

32
00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:35.340
Ry Jones: Okay, there are a couple that aren't but it's.

33
00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:39.390
Ry Jones: We can address that later, I think.

34
00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:40.800
Tracy Kuhrt: Okay.

35
00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:49.470
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): yeah I mean, as I said before, I mean we can always expand on it and we trade it's not the end of the world.

36
00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:54.750
Tracy Kuhrt: that's right yeah if we come up with other things that we want to add to this after the fact.

37
00:05:55.170 --> 00:06:06.990
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): And I suspect this kind of small things are not controversial by any means, just like you know, so we can just schedule Leah agree through a pull requests and.

38
00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:09.090
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): Small additions.

39
00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:12.120
Tracy Kuhrt: completely agree on oh.

40
00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:22.650
Tracy Kuhrt: Okay, any other questions or comments any objections to us voting I guess would be.

41
00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:25.200
Tracy Kuhrt: Where we're at at this point.

42
00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:44.700
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): So, to be clear, I mean we're talking about approving this pull request with the two additional changes which is adding this requirement, about being on the Ts mailing list and the github or.

43
00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:48.960
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): And and adding the missing s.

44
00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:49.500
Adding.

45
00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:58.920
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): it's funny after all, you know so many people looking at it is like we still miss it and it's like oh wait.

46
00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:01.770
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): But it's good.

47
00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:04.920
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): yeah.

48
00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:12.240
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): So i'm happy to approve this of course.

49
00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.900
Tracy Kuhrt: Alright, so shall we take that as emotion, or no.

50
00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:18.120
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): Yes.

51
00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:19.050
Tracy Kuhrt: We have a.

52
00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:20.850
Nathan George: Second.

53
00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:24.570
Tracy Kuhrt: Alright, thanks anything um.

54
00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:30.420
Tracy Kuhrt: you're right do you want to lead us through but it doesn't have to be roll call vote, but just uh.

55
00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:31.680
yeah.

56
00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:35.190
Ry Jones: All those who wish to abstain.

57
00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:38.400
Ry Jones: abstain or some.

58
00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:44.070
Ry Jones: All those in.

59
00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:49.590
Ry Jones: who wish for the motion, not pass please say, nay.

60
00:07:52.470 --> 00:07:55.140
Ry Jones: And all in favor say Aye Aye captain.

61
00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:04.500
Ry Jones: Motion passes.

62
00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:06.240
Arnaud J Le Hors (IBM): Thank you.

63
00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:09.150
Tracy Kuhrt: Thanks Ray.

64
00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:15.960
Tracy Kuhrt: And thanks for putting that together for us and for all the input that we had from the TC on that.

65
00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:34.500
Tracy Kuhrt: particular issue, so as far as I know we don't have any any additional on PC business this week, but before we get to the task force discussion is there any PC business that we should be talking about that I did not know about or didn't include in our agenda.

66
00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:44.520
Ry Jones: I did for this issue on and then.

67
00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:46.320
Ry Jones: Dino.

68
00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:48.870
Ry Jones: found a pull request.

69
00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:51.690
Ry Jones: I would just like the dsc to.

70
00:08:52.770 --> 00:09:00.870
Ry Jones: You know, read this over and add comments on dale's pull request we don't have to discuss in this meeting.

71
00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:04.350
Tracy Kuhrt: Okay, thanks for that I will.

72
00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:10.410
Tracy Kuhrt: have to review is that pull request 33 I think it was.

73
00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:12.420
Danno Ferrin: 33.

74
00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:13.230
Danno Ferrin: All right.

75
00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:16.050
Tracy Kuhrt: So yeah pull request 33 on the TT repo.

76
00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:29.310
Tracy Kuhrt: we'll make sure we include that on the discussion items for next week, but feel free to have a look at that before we get to next week, any other PC business anybody would like to bring up at this point.

77
00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:50.580
Tracy Kuhrt: Alright, see nobody coming off mute or raising their hands, I will take that as a no so Jim I guess it is up to you to walk us through the task force discussion for a project health dashboard.

78
00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:55.260
Jim Zhang: sounds good thanks Tracy Mr sharing.

79
00:09:58.410 --> 00:10:12.000
Jim Zhang: Okay, so I created the task force page and there will be a page for today's minute, but I guess, just as a refresher for everyone for the background of this.

80
00:10:13.290 --> 00:10:14.070
Jim Zhang: This thread.

81
00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:30.120
Jim Zhang: We were talking about project reports in early January, and there was a follow up action to to think about what kind of data can we pull pull together.

82
00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:32.670
Jim Zhang: To January, some sort of.

83
00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:35.130
Jim Zhang: Report.

84
00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:37.170
Jim Zhang: For every project.

85
00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:51.420
Jim Zhang: Whenever the tasc needs to make decisions on the health status of a project, this could be a status change on the project from innovation to active, or vice vice versa.

86
00:10:52.950 --> 00:10:55.740
Jim Zhang: or four laps to to go into incubation.

87
00:10:57.270 --> 00:11:05.220
Jim Zhang: Just feel like if we have the right types of data than a lot of decisions can be made much easier and faster.

88
00:11:06.570 --> 00:11:14.160
Jim Zhang: So there's already pretty good sources of such data, such as the insight.

89
00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:23.430
Jim Zhang: By Linux foundation and there's also previous efforts in particular made by Tracy and others.

90
00:11:24.510 --> 00:11:28.710
Jim Zhang: to generate reports, based on github data.

91
00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:39.990
Jim Zhang: So this effort is to kind of pull together all the all the thinking and get this.

92
00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:42.390
Jim Zhang: get this.

93
00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:56.790
Jim Zhang: take it to the to the finish line, basically, so we can have these be hosted somewhere or maybe there is something that can be embedded in every report just by default.

94
00:11:57.780 --> 00:12:09.300
Jim Zhang: So every every report will have this be automatically generated from all the data sources so that's the that's the thinking behind this effort and.

95
00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:23.880
Jim Zhang: there's a running issue in github that has got contributions from many people thanks for everybody who's participated and and the result of the discussion we've got so far.

96
00:12:25.230 --> 00:12:26.460
Jim Zhang: Is captured.

97
00:12:27.510 --> 00:12:28.170
Jim Zhang: here.

98
00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:31.950
Jim Zhang: On this page.

99
00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:41.760
Jim Zhang: But I want to start with the High Level goals, so we can talk about it and agree, and then we can get into.

100
00:12:43.080 --> 00:13:01.050
Jim Zhang: The details, so I think the High Level goals as as displayed here is together and present rich set of data about a project can be both top level projects and labs and enable data driven decision making at tasc.

101
00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:11.460
Jim Zhang: Specific tasks to be completed number one, we need to define the types of data that makes sense, this has been what.

102
00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:16.440
Jim Zhang: The participants on this effort, have been focusing on.

103
00:13:18.390 --> 00:13:35.250
Jim Zhang: What are the types of data that would help with the decision making is it on code is it on person is it on activity that sort of thing and then we should decide how to collect that kind of thing.

104
00:13:36.630 --> 00:13:47.940
Jim Zhang: Given the data we believe are useful, where to find it, how to collect them and based on the discussions we've got so far, some of them.

105
00:13:49.500 --> 00:14:00.570
Jim Zhang: will be available programmatically but others we may have to resort to manual contribution manual collection.

106
00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:10.050
Jim Zhang: For the list of deliverables for this task force, I think we should.

107
00:14:11.850 --> 00:14:14.250
Jim Zhang: document, the decisions.

108
00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:26.520
Jim Zhang: In the github issue or maybe there's other better format to document what we decided on.

109
00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:33.210
Jim Zhang: And we should discuss with the Linux foundation insight it team.

110
00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:38.670
Jim Zhang: about enhancing the dashboard and the gathering of the data.

111
00:14:38.970 --> 00:14:40.560
Jim Zhang: and generating reports.

112
00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:48.930
Jim Zhang: Such capabilities are missing today there's a lot in there, but some key capabilities are still missing.

113
00:14:51.510 --> 00:15:09.690
Jim Zhang: And for the if we have data that has to be collected manually, then we need to publish some sort of recommended practices, so the Community can make the information available, and we can collect them.

114
00:15:13.350 --> 00:15:25.860
Jim Zhang: I like to think we could accomplish everything in three months if that's not at that time turns out to be too optimistic probably six months.

115
00:15:26.970 --> 00:15:30.270
Jim Zhang: At most, and we should time opposite.

116
00:15:31.950 --> 00:15:33.060
Jim Zhang: So.

117
00:15:35.790 --> 00:15:45.510
Jim Zhang: let's let's let's look at what we've got so far, so this is just capturing the input from the previous discussions in the.

118
00:15:46.830 --> 00:16:02.340
Jim Zhang: In the in the issue, so I can go through these items and but everybody, please feel free to jump in on any of these points, and we can discuss more so.

119
00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:25.050
Jim Zhang: We put this in edit mode Okay, so the first one first category is Community I think that's that's a no brainer that it's a key success to the to any projects is a diverse active Community that cares about the code base.

120
00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:33.210
Jim Zhang: So we've got five subcategories and underneath that growth.

121
00:16:34.830 --> 00:16:54.180
Jim Zhang: Is the Community growing diversity is it looked after by a single org name organization, or does it have a diverse source of contributions which tend to make the project more viable in the long run.

122
00:16:56.730 --> 00:17:16.410
Jim Zhang: retention is for contributors do they feel their input are are being respected being valued and their code contributions are getting to the main branch and getting to customers hands so they're delivering value.

123
00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:24.990
Jim Zhang: or skip maturity to the end, because I was having trouble.

124
00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:36.330
Jim Zhang: articulating articulating this so maybe someone else can help with this one responsiveness is kind of.

125
00:17:37.770 --> 00:17:44.580
Jim Zhang: tight to allow the others, is how responsive is the current contributor group.

126
00:17:46.020 --> 00:18:01.890
Jim Zhang: or two to potential contributors, maybe they reached out on discord or through a PR or they are they given attentions are due diligence being.

127
00:18:02.910 --> 00:18:05.430
Jim Zhang: given to their to their contributions.

128
00:18:06.810 --> 00:18:08.100
Jim Zhang: So.

129
00:18:09.870 --> 00:18:16.530
Jim Zhang: maturity I I feel like this came from David I don't know if David is on.

130
00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:17.490
David Boswell: yeah.

131
00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:18.450
Jim Zhang: i'm here now is can.

132
00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:20.940
Jim Zhang: Speak to this yeah go ahead.

133
00:18:22.110 --> 00:18:30.600
David Boswell: So basically I my thought of maturity, was it gives context to the other stats there so, for example, if you're a brand new project have only been around for a month or two.

134
00:18:31.230 --> 00:18:39.600
David Boswell: Your stats are very likely going to look different from somebody who's perhaps you know, been around for a project has been around for several years and has a different.

135
00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:44.730
David Boswell: The Community is going to look different right, I mean, I think, for example, that new project.

136
00:18:45.330 --> 00:18:52.770
David Boswell: Probably won't have the same sort of organizational diversity, so it helps give context right I think something that might be a red flag.

137
00:18:53.130 --> 00:18:59.160
David Boswell: For a more mature project, for example, if you if you didn't have organizational diversity after.

138
00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:10.440
David Boswell: Three years, for example, that might be a red flag, whereas if you don't have organizational diversity and you just started that's not a black right, I mean it's natural for a new project that just came from one organization, for example.

139
00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:19.260
David Boswell: To not have that diversity, yet, so I think it's just a way to help set context for those other projects and I meant diversity here are maturity here, in the sense of.

140
00:19:21.210 --> 00:19:31.080
David Boswell: You can measure it simply by age, for example, or the stage, you know, an incubator project is going to be less mature in this sense, and I graduated projects that's all I meant by that.

141
00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:32.880
Jim Zhang: Okay gotcha.

142
00:19:33.570 --> 00:19:34.440
That makes sense.

143
00:19:35.790 --> 00:19:44.490
Jim Zhang: So I guess this maturity is more of more of a qualifier rather than a category by itself.

144
00:19:45.030 --> 00:19:54.360
Tracy Kuhrt: Well, Jim I would I would add, specifically, maybe a couple of bullets there why around when was the first code commit.

145
00:19:55.380 --> 00:20:00.060
Tracy Kuhrt: And then maybe another around frequency of releases.

146
00:20:03.990 --> 00:20:05.640
Jim Zhang: yeah okay.

147
00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:11.310
Tracy Kuhrt: Because I think i'm more mature project is well I think when you're when you're.

148
00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:25.410
Tracy Kuhrt: Like if you look at fabric right I think they have quarterly releases that's a pretty mature project are able to you know get to a place where they can plan for releases every three months and successfully do that.

149
00:20:26.850 --> 00:20:42.570
Tracy Kuhrt: versus you know, maybe a newer project hasn't quite figured out when they should do releases or how often or how they manage that whole process, so I think you know that's the sort of thing that I think about when I say frequency of releases.

150
00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:45.300
Jim Zhang: Okay gotcha.

151
00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:55.500
Jim Zhang: Are they are they able to stick to the published really schedule that reflects the maturity.

152
00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:04.110
Jim Zhang: yeah yeah definitely makes sense when you're working on still working on like core foundation of the architecture.

153
00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:21.180
Jim Zhang: You could easily step into unforeseen complexities and previously published schedule be blown out of the water versus if it's a mature code base and it's just adding enhancements than that it's much easier to.

154
00:21:22.380 --> 00:21:25.650
Jim Zhang: to stick to the schedule yeah that makes sense.

155
00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:43.710
Jim Zhang: Any other comments on on these aspects on community itself are we missing any important aspects as far as the health indicators of the Community itself.

156
00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:06.330
Jim Zhang: Okay yeah we can always revisit this later so i'll continue.

157
00:22:07.650 --> 00:22:09.390
Jim Zhang: For the code aspect.

158
00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:12.510
Jim Zhang: that's obviously another important.

159
00:22:14.130 --> 00:22:21.240
Jim Zhang: dimension for project is the code itself and so far we've got two categories.

160
00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:25.560
Jim Zhang: One we call usefulness.

161
00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:30.060
Jim Zhang: Which is.

162
00:22:31.110 --> 00:22:57.210
Jim Zhang: How are the general Community reacting to this projects functionality, it can be really cool can have a lot of coding there, but if people are not using it it's indicator that it's either way ahead of its time or maybe there's a better solution somewhere else so.

163
00:22:58.470 --> 00:23:00.210
Jim Zhang: usefulness is.

164
00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:06.450
Jim Zhang: Our Is this the right solution for the right problem.

165
00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:19.200
Jim Zhang: Is the is the problem that's being addressed or a real problem, how many people are struggling with it so that's that's the that's the usefulness aspect.

166
00:23:21.780 --> 00:23:24.270
Jim Zhang: notice that we didn't really.

167
00:23:25.290 --> 00:23:29.460
Jim Zhang: capture some sort of.

168
00:23:34.350 --> 00:23:39.840
Jim Zhang: Popular aspect for code, how many lines of code is in the project.

169
00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:43.950
Jim Zhang: How active is the code being pushed.

170
00:23:47.430 --> 00:23:49.080
Jim Zhang: I don't think it's.

171
00:23:50.580 --> 00:24:01.980
Jim Zhang: A necessary good indicator to the health status of a project, because you can be working on something you know just among the few people.

172
00:24:02.970 --> 00:24:18.390
Jim Zhang: That pushes ton of code and you know, there are 10 PRS every day, but if if you are the ones who only you're the only ones work here who care about this code base for a long time that's indicator that.

173
00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:22.830
Jim Zhang: This is not very useful to the general general Community.

174
00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:28.770
Jim Zhang: Okay.

175
00:24:28.830 --> 00:24:36.750
Dave Enyeart: Good on that point, I do think the commit rate is important and how it changes over time for a project I don't think that's captured anywhere here.

176
00:24:40.020 --> 00:24:40.770
Jim Zhang: Committed rate.

177
00:24:42.150 --> 00:24:45.420
Jim Zhang: How many lines of code are being pushed in.

178
00:24:45.690 --> 00:24:50.220
Dave Enyeart: or number of commits per month or something like that, and then you can look at that over time.

179
00:24:54.660 --> 00:25:04.080
Dave Enyeart: Like in the fabric reports, I always put a commit for the quarter number, and then I compare it to the previous year, so we can kind of get a feel for is it less active or more active.

180
00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:08.970
Jim Zhang: I guess that's.

181
00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:12.720
Jim Zhang: It feels like a different dimension.

182
00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:28.890
Jim Zhang: cuz your fabric, the usefulness is is out of the question so that's that be established, first, I think things like rates is a useful indicator right.

183
00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:34.410
Dave Enyeart: yeah I agree it's probably not under the usefulness category, but I think somewhere, we should capture it.

184
00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:35.370
He.

185
00:25:36.540 --> 00:25:38.820
Jim Zhang: We need something.

186
00:25:40.050 --> 00:25:41.610
Jim Zhang: placeholder.

187
00:25:43.410 --> 00:25:45.330
Jim Zhang: Think of something to call this.

188
00:25:48.630 --> 00:25:51.330
Dave Enyeart: could be like based metrics or something because it's kind of a fundamental.

189
00:25:52.470 --> 00:25:53.100
Dave Enyeart: metric.

190
00:25:53.550 --> 00:25:53.790
yeah.

191
00:25:58.410 --> 00:26:05.160
Nathan George: Well, and maybe to say something more about that were the production readiness and the usefulness is really trying to measure the growth.

192
00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:14.310
Nathan George: Of the project this metric seems to be monitoring for when a project might cool down or when a project might be.

193
00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:26.370
Nathan George: starting to become less interesting, for whatever reason, so there's probably a few other statistics we could put in here that would help us understand if maybe people are moving off on to other ideas or off on to other projects.

194
00:26:31.110 --> 00:26:31.890
Jim Zhang: Good plane.

195
00:26:38.850 --> 00:26:42.780
Tracy Kuhrt: And Jim Hart has his hand up I don't know if you're able to why you're.

196
00:26:42.930 --> 00:26:44.430
Jim Zhang: Sorry yeah I wasn't able to.

197
00:26:45.330 --> 00:26:46.440
Tracy Kuhrt: Make sure to keep track.

198
00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:46.530
Tracy Kuhrt: Of.

199
00:26:47.010 --> 00:26:48.300
Jim Zhang: yeah Thank you, I appreciate it.

200
00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:49.680
Jim Zhang: yeah hard go ahead.

201
00:26:50.310 --> 00:26:58.080
Hart Montgomery: hey Jim so I like this one thing that I don't see mentioned here that I think is important and I don't know where we want to put it as documentation.

202
00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:00.390
Jim Zhang: yeah.

203
00:27:01.530 --> 00:27:04.650
Hart Montgomery: So I don't know whether that goes under code Community or what.

204
00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:14.250
Hart Montgomery: But I think it's an important thing and and we should have some it should be included in this document.

205
00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:23.760
Jim Zhang: If I agree, I mean people can get their hands on how easy or difficult it is that's a.

206
00:27:25.620 --> 00:27:33.390
Jim Zhang: Pretty critical, I guess, this would be more of a manual or subjective measurement.

207
00:27:35.550 --> 00:27:43.080
Jim Zhang: Right, the quality of the docs I guess we're mainly referring to the quality of the dogs right heart.

208
00:27:43.650 --> 00:27:48.360
Hart Montgomery: Well sure, but just the existence of documentation to various different things right.

209
00:27:50.190 --> 00:27:50.550
Jim Zhang: and

210
00:27:51.180 --> 00:27:52.110
Hart Montgomery: So yeah both.

211
00:27:54.870 --> 00:27:57.240
Jim Zhang: yeah okay that makes sense.

212
00:27:58.260 --> 00:27:59.850
Tracy Kuhrt: And Bobby has her hand up as well.

213
00:28:01.530 --> 00:28:01.770
Bobbi Muscara: yeah i'd.

214
00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:11.700
Bobbi Muscara: Like to i'd like to help you out with that piece because we're working, we have a task force in the learning materials development working group right now to create some kind of badging.

215
00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:22.650
Bobbi Muscara: That will fit into the existing structure so we'll talk later, but I would like to be a part of that piece, because our task force will be reporting on that shortly.

216
00:28:31.980 --> 00:28:33.330
Jim Zhang: awesome I appreciate that.

217
00:28:34.350 --> 00:28:40.110
Jim Zhang: So we can talk in more details, how to sort of wrap these aspects into a.

218
00:28:40.290 --> 00:28:41.490
Jim Zhang: into a badging.

219
00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:47.700
Jim Zhang: Criteria and have it be captured in a more concise manner.

220
00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:51.840
Jim Zhang: that's great so we haven't talked.

221
00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:53.880
Jim Zhang: About this, this part.

222
00:28:55.350 --> 00:28:58.710
Jim Zhang: I believe this was brought up by heart during the discussion.

223
00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:01.320
Jim Zhang: Production readiness.

224
00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:13.080
Jim Zhang: it's kind of related to the usefulness, which what naturally to this being used in production and the team working on making it production ready.

225
00:29:14.490 --> 00:29:26.700
Jim Zhang: so obvious indicators include has been a one dot zero release what's the test coverage performance and reliability tests.

226
00:29:29.250 --> 00:29:34.020
Jim Zhang: And I guess documentation is somewhat captured here.

227
00:29:39.810 --> 00:29:53.880
Jim Zhang: yeah so this would apply more to the top level projects, but even for labs a good documentation would be a.

228
00:29:54.930 --> 00:29:55.920
Jim Zhang: Pretty big.

229
00:29:57.150 --> 00:30:02.910
Jim Zhang: factor to be considered when this lab is brought brought up for.

230
00:30:04.470 --> 00:30:07.080
Jim Zhang: For proposal to become incubation.

231
00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:20.160
Jim Zhang: Okay, so I guess, overall, we feel pretty good about the aspects on the code aspect.

232
00:30:23.610 --> 00:30:25.290
Jim Zhang: Anything else we should consider.

233
00:30:27.870 --> 00:30:37.950
Artem Barger: So, Jim I don't I don't know what the best could take a degree to put this year, but the problem might consider something that is related topics it reflects the.

234
00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:54.330
Artem Barger: Innovation around the project so, for example, the amount of a you know resuscitation so resource publication, that is a around the area, the technology that the project has been developing is producing.

235
00:30:55.980 --> 00:30:59.130
Jim Zhang: See it's not it's not it's not directed the code.

236
00:30:59.490 --> 00:31:10.080
Artem Barger: But it's a you know we are working in the Boston area that is kind of you know everything is in distributed system cryptography consensus on server and you know.

237
00:31:11.070 --> 00:31:24.990
Artem Barger: it's supposed to be quite a lot of research for your on this effort, so I think that this indicator of might reflect the innovation around the project and the direction the project is heading towards.

238
00:31:26.430 --> 00:31:29.790
Jim Zhang: So do you think makes sense, it falls under usefulness.

239
00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:31.530
Jim Zhang: may be.

240
00:31:31.590 --> 00:31:45.510
Jim Zhang: This is more research effort so even though it's not being picked up by regular users by it generates research publications and it's being cited in.

241
00:31:46.890 --> 00:31:48.510
Jim Zhang: In other people's work.

242
00:31:50.220 --> 00:31:52.980
Jim Zhang: he's like this belongs under usefulness.

243
00:31:54.390 --> 00:32:07.440
Artem Barger: So it might reflect the foremost, but I think that you know it might might be to basically devote a completely separate second section that you know stands for innovation.

244
00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:20.910
Artem Barger: Because you know, a shelter project, in my opinion, has to innovate, the once in a while, and you know if you'll be able to capture the level of innovation that brought up by the project might be might be good.

245
00:32:25.020 --> 00:32:25.440
Jim Zhang: But yeah.

246
00:32:29.430 --> 00:32:30.450
Jim Zhang: yeah go ahead.

247
00:32:30.630 --> 00:32:40.050
Hart Montgomery: yeah I think this is a good topic we can measure it, you know reasonably well by looking at like a printer archive for all of the other like.

248
00:32:41.310 --> 00:32:57.930
Hart Montgomery: Research publication websites this it measures you know academic interest in something, and it will let us know sort of like you know what people who are interested in the most cutting edge technology are you know.

249
00:32:58.980 --> 00:33:00.450
Hart Montgomery: Are are following great.

250
00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:14.010
Hart Montgomery: So you know this, this is definitely something it's something I have sort of done myself actually about a bunch of these projects, and I think it's a good metric.

251
00:33:16.050 --> 00:33:16.920
Hart Montgomery: To.

252
00:33:17.940 --> 00:33:23.160
Hart Montgomery: measure as art and put it sort of how cutting edge, something is.

253
00:33:31.740 --> 00:33:33.060
Jim Zhang: yeah okay.

254
00:33:34.860 --> 00:33:36.450
Jim Zhang: That makes sense.

255
00:33:37.980 --> 00:33:40.290
Hart Montgomery: i'm referring to the ar XIV.

256
00:33:41.700 --> 00:33:43.860
Jim Zhang: yeah that's what I was trying to spell.

257
00:33:44.670 --> 00:33:45.510
Hart Montgomery: The Horace.

258
00:33:46.770 --> 00:33:47.880
Jim Zhang: Only manage the three.

259
00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:48.690
Jim Zhang: Letters of that.

260
00:33:56.820 --> 00:33:58.050
Tracy Kuhrt: hey if it hasn't signed up as well.

261
00:33:59.460 --> 00:34:00.300
Jim Zhang: yeah go ahead.

262
00:34:01.260 --> 00:34:06.420
Nathan George: i'm a classic quote is you manage what you measure.

263
00:34:07.470 --> 00:34:24.000
Nathan George: And so I like how we've kind of separated some categories here of the different numbers and what we think that they're useful for because one of the dangers here is if we put the wrong numbers in front of the wrong audiences they'll try to optimize for things that might not be healthy.

264
00:34:25.260 --> 00:34:35.070
Nathan George: For example, it would be, it would probably be a bad thing if a project tried to maximize their e print air XIV numbers by themselves.

265
00:34:35.550 --> 00:34:48.210
Nathan George: Have or if they tried to increase a number at the expense of the stability of their community, so I wonder if, once we finished kind of this all the things we might want to look at it would be good for us to.

266
00:34:49.020 --> 00:35:04.110
Nathan George: split this dashboard of statistics to the more than one category, because some of these things are things we would want to put in front of me taters and say you should watch these, but some of them are not because they could lead to optimizing the wrong things for sustainability.

267
00:35:05.130 --> 00:35:19.650
Jim Zhang: That makes sense you're saying, if a project is not really driven for innovation, it they shouldn't be staring at the stairs or the dashboard this category is always zero.

268
00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:27.750
Nathan George: Well, or likewise a lot of early stage project might really need to worry about how many people are contributing and how often are they contributing.

269
00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:40.620
Nathan George: But a stable project might need to say we need to get people to bundle their commits better because the thing we need to optimize for is maintainer burden as opposed to onboarding more more people, so I.

270
00:35:41.340 --> 00:35:56.730
Nathan George: It feels like we need to give some thought to the life cycle of the project and which statistics are most important web, because if we can help the maintainer focus on the right things it'll make the job, a lot easier if we make them focus on everything it'll make your job, a lot harder.

271
00:35:57.900 --> 00:35:58.170
Jim Zhang: yeah.

272
00:36:01.740 --> 00:36:04.590
Jim Zhang: Do you think this captured your concern here.

273
00:36:06.600 --> 00:36:09.270
Jim Zhang: Sure okay cool appreciate that.

274
00:36:09.900 --> 00:36:17.280
Ry Jones: I will point out this document is in edit mode so like other tlc members to feel free to.

275
00:36:18.330 --> 00:36:18.960
Ry Jones: jump in.

276
00:36:19.710 --> 00:36:23.280
Jim Zhang: Here definitely thanks for that reminder.

277
00:36:24.660 --> 00:36:27.660
Jim Zhang: Okay, let me go ahead and date.

278
00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:31.590
cool.

279
00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:37.140
Ry Jones: I just met in terms of you know, we do we multiple people can edit at the same time.

280
00:36:37.650 --> 00:36:41.100
Ry Jones: yeah so other people wanted to jump in here and help edit.

281
00:36:51.330 --> 00:37:09.210
Jim Zhang: So I guess for today's call i'd like to focus on making sure these dimensions are as complete as we can manage and then we can we can use follow up calls to talk about detailed measures to collect them.

282
00:37:11.130 --> 00:37:22.740
Jim Zhang: So I guess on both categories are there any other things, we should consider, or is there a complete new categories, where are missing here.

283
00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:39.510
Nathan George: there's a couple of early pipeline interest things that sometimes are worth looking at it sometimes you're not.

284
00:37:39.900 --> 00:37:55.410
Nathan George: Like how many stars or forks there are other repositories how many people have signed up for the mailing list or how many how many users are inside of the chat channels, where it may not indicate act actual activity, but it might indicate that.

285
00:37:56.850 --> 00:38:00.150
Nathan George: There are folks we have the opportunity to invite to create that activity.

286
00:38:05.100 --> 00:38:08.340
Jim Zhang: So i'm.

287
00:38:10.470 --> 00:38:12.150
Jim Zhang: Trying to capture.

288
00:38:14.280 --> 00:38:26.520
Jim Zhang: What What this means in terms of the data that can be so you're saying there could be a different dashboard that is presented to early early stage projects.

289
00:38:27.690 --> 00:38:36.450
Nathan George: um well when I said that I said it a lot like, if you remember the statistics page that I showed us before it talks about kind of.

290
00:38:37.650 --> 00:38:42.180
Nathan George: A new contributors versus mature contributors versus inactive contributors.

291
00:38:42.300 --> 00:38:42.990
Nathan George: there's this kind of.

292
00:38:43.470 --> 00:38:45.870
Nathan George: People who are poking around expressing interest.

293
00:38:47.460 --> 00:38:59.400
Nathan George: kind of part of the the contributor pipeline of people just they're signing up for the mailing list and they're lurking or they've started the repository because they want to watch to see what might be happening next.

294
00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:04.650
Nathan George: year if we think of the maintainer is is kind of managing a.

295
00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:13.380
Nathan George: pipeline of new traders, that they have the potential to onboard seeing a lot of activity at this stage of the pipeline might eat it's time to.

296
00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:30.900
Nathan George: invite people to do something or go go get your ticket repository and label whole bunch of things as good first bugs if you see a bunch of people kind of wandering by and starting to stop and stare it's a chance to invite them to join.

297
00:39:32.910 --> 00:39:33.300
Jim Zhang: yeah.

298
00:39:36.210 --> 00:39:37.590
Jim Zhang: So that that's more of.

299
00:39:40.230 --> 00:39:51.420
Jim Zhang: Not measuring the health by helping the helping the providing the data to the mainers so they can they can.

300
00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:54.390
Jim Zhang: Better grow the Community.

301
00:39:55.500 --> 00:40:02.850
Jim Zhang: So this is not so much helping the thc the judges more to help maintain nurse to grow.

302
00:40:05.670 --> 00:40:06.270
Nathan George: yeah.

303
00:40:08.370 --> 00:40:13.410
Nathan George: yeah and for me that's ultimately that's what ptsd is trying to do and measuring as well as that.

304
00:40:14.700 --> 00:40:17.130
Jim Zhang: I guess yeah I guess.

305
00:40:17.160 --> 00:40:18.030
Jim Zhang: that's correct.

306
00:40:20.190 --> 00:40:22.080
Jim Zhang: Okay, so.

307
00:40:49.980 --> 00:40:56.730
Tracy Kuhrt: On the maturity section I don't know if this is right place for it or it's a good.

308
00:40:57.240 --> 00:41:01.350
Tracy Kuhrt: measure of maturity, but the number of good first issues Nathan, when you said that that.

309
00:41:01.890 --> 00:41:04.110
Tracy Kuhrt: popped into my head is something that maybe.

310
00:41:05.550 --> 00:41:08.760
Tracy Kuhrt: We would want to be able to look at as well.

311
00:41:11.550 --> 00:41:14.100
Jim Zhang: yeah so we're saying.

312
00:41:15.690 --> 00:41:21.120
Jim Zhang: A mature project should have more of these are the other way around.

313
00:41:24.420 --> 00:41:37.710
Tracy Kuhrt: I think that a mature project should have them because it indicates that they're willing to work with others and and I don't know, maybe it goes under at different.

314
00:41:38.820 --> 00:41:52.410
Tracy Kuhrt: Maybe it's not maturity, maybe it's something else, but I just feel like it says something about the Community if they're willing to bring on new contributors and mentor those contributors through those good first issues.

315
00:41:54.360 --> 00:41:59.010
Jim Zhang: gotcha, so this is kind of a is the Community is.

316
00:42:00.090 --> 00:42:03.570
Jim Zhang: Project friendly to new contributors.

317
00:42:04.080 --> 00:42:11.670
Tracy Kuhrt: yeah that's probably a good way of looking at that so maybe it's a completely different sort of metric under Community.

318
00:42:13.140 --> 00:42:14.730
Tracy Kuhrt: And heart has his hand up as well.

319
00:42:15.360 --> 00:42:24.540
Hart Montgomery: yeah I was just going to suggest exactly your last point there Tracy I think this is really important, and I think we could have a whole category on.

320
00:42:25.650 --> 00:42:29.820
Hart Montgomery: Ease of new contributions or sort of new person onboarding great.

321
00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:37.620
Hart Montgomery: We would like projects to have sort of smooth ways for new people to get involved.

322
00:42:39.960 --> 00:42:41.100
Hart Montgomery: So you know.

323
00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:46.470
Hart Montgomery: Good first issues is is adjust one of these things right.

324
00:42:47.880 --> 00:42:52.260
Hart Montgomery: There are a lot of other different things that some projects do to help new contributors.

325
00:42:54.030 --> 00:42:56.790
Hart Montgomery: So yeah I think this is where the whole category.

326
00:42:59.970 --> 00:43:02.430
Jim Zhang: Or do you think this country is that category.

327
00:43:03.750 --> 00:43:04.560
Hart Montgomery: Sure yeah.

328
00:43:05.160 --> 00:43:06.750
Jim Zhang: Okay cool.

329
00:43:09.060 --> 00:43:09.720
Jim Zhang: that's.

330
00:43:10.410 --> 00:43:18.210
Nathan George: Great I was just going to challenge, whether that's a different category than responsiveness I think how how this is.

331
00:43:19.350 --> 00:43:29.610
Nathan George: How you respond to new contributors is is an important metric of responsiveness, and I think one of the things that we often see and why one of the why of.

332
00:43:30.600 --> 00:43:38.160
Nathan George: How we measure time result vr is time to respond to questions is to make sure that there's not kind of a hidden decision making cabal.

333
00:43:39.390 --> 00:43:44.670
Nathan George: inside of the project, where some folks get their issues responded to quickly and other folks get their issues perpetually ignored.

334
00:43:45.300 --> 00:43:57.150
Nathan George: Because that's a good sign that the projects having internal conflict or is likely to fork or have other troubles, and I think these friendliness numbers kind of all fit into that kind of a category of is everyone.

335
00:43:58.410 --> 00:44:00.960
Nathan George: committed to working together and responding to one another.

336
00:44:04.950 --> 00:44:05.190
Nathan George: Are.

337
00:44:05.220 --> 00:44:06.660
Jim Zhang: Tracy, what do you think.

338
00:44:12.180 --> 00:44:15.060
Hart Montgomery: Well, you know responsive how we've.

339
00:44:16.530 --> 00:44:16.980
Hart Montgomery: You know.

340
00:44:18.360 --> 00:44:23.070
Hart Montgomery: The way we've defined responsiveness right now is more about like.

341
00:44:24.330 --> 00:44:34.110
Hart Montgomery: Time to communication, you know if we want to make a more general definition of like Community responsiveness that's fine.

342
00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:37.950
Hart Montgomery: You know I thought it.

343
00:44:39.240 --> 00:44:46.200
Hart Montgomery: I thought responsiveness had meant something more specific, but if we want it to be something broader that's fine too.

344
00:44:47.520 --> 00:45:01.050
Hart Montgomery: You know, however, we classify these things or incorporate them into categories, you know it's it's not as important as it sort of just all being mentioned so i'm really fine with, however, we want to present this.

345
00:45:03.990 --> 00:45:15.870
Jim Zhang: How about this, I think, maybe there's an aspect you guys are trying to capture Tracy heart is how easy is for someone to solve to get self started to to sort of.

346
00:45:16.500 --> 00:45:26.400
Jim Zhang: know this is something they can they can get their hands on before even talking to people, this is sort of their first impression kind of thing.

347
00:45:27.390 --> 00:45:40.080
Jim Zhang: Whereas responsiveness is more once a contributor has done something after have having you know evaluated this.

348
00:45:40.740 --> 00:45:57.210
Jim Zhang: Then, how are they being treated by the by the maintainer group, because if you didn't have a good list of these things, it would be pretty difficult for a contributor to to get started right.

349
00:46:00.900 --> 00:46:06.570
Jim Zhang: And then responsiveness wouldn't be reflected at all because there's no communication.

350
00:46:13.200 --> 00:46:15.420
Tracy Kuhrt: And thank you, they go hand in hand.

351
00:46:17.040 --> 00:46:24.840
Tracy Kuhrt: I think that you know somebody starting out first issue they're probably going to be asking a lot of questions and then their.

352
00:46:26.220 --> 00:46:36.060
Tracy Kuhrt: Time to get a response on say discord is going to impact, whether or not they can be working in the issue or not right was that first impression that they got of the.

353
00:46:36.540 --> 00:46:53.340
Tracy Kuhrt: Community something that was a good first impression, or it really just turned them off completely and they decided they'd go spend their time where they you know felt more welcomed into the Community and sorry rude I started speaking before I noticed, you had your hand up.

354
00:46:55.740 --> 00:47:07.230
Aruna S M: No research so as him like I can speak now yep um I think on since we are on this topic right, one of the hard thing right now for us to measure or you know something's happening over there is.

355
00:47:08.100 --> 00:47:18.210
Aruna S M: When we know their contributors and then understand the code base, and they would like to proceed with the contributions, however, they are not aligned to the projects roadmap or.

356
00:47:18.750 --> 00:47:28.500
Aruna S M: What project maintenance currently think of right, so there is definitely a conflict of interest among those contributors and how would they like to answer them are.

357
00:47:29.760 --> 00:47:36.870
Aruna S M: Where would they like to take it up from there, so I have heard such concerns earlier in a couple of projects, but.

358
00:47:38.490 --> 00:47:53.280
Aruna S M: I don't know I think that's a bigger can of worms if we were to discuss that topic and I don't have answers as to how to measure or how to call can we win might understand that something like this exist internally to those projects.

359
00:47:55.500 --> 00:48:00.060
Jim Zhang: So just make sure I understand you're saying.

360
00:48:02.280 --> 00:48:09.900
Jim Zhang: Do we want to detect the situation where there are conflicting priorities within the maintainer group of a project.

361
00:48:11.340 --> 00:48:11.670
Aruna S M: you're trying.

362
00:48:12.120 --> 00:48:12.780
Aruna S M: To prevent.

363
00:48:13.620 --> 00:48:22.950
Aruna S M: This is to prevent either of them from stopping to contribute, or you want to prevent them from creating a new coke off after project altogether.

364
00:48:26.340 --> 00:48:26.880
Jim Zhang: Okay.

365
00:48:33.450 --> 00:48:34.590
Jim Zhang: me too.

366
00:48:48.600 --> 00:48:51.390
Jim Zhang: yeah splitting up the beauty, so the.

367
00:48:52.470 --> 00:49:00.870
Jim Zhang: Have we have we seen evidence of this happening, either now or before I mean this is definitely a.

368
00:49:02.670 --> 00:49:10.350
Jim Zhang: theoretical possibility but we We believe this is happening and it's it should be a concern.

369
00:49:12.360 --> 00:49:16.380
Jim Zhang: By how important how hyper do you think this is.

370
00:49:21.450 --> 00:49:29.190
Aruna S M: So it can answer if something like this happened, and to my understanding is I could see something like this happening in the past.

371
00:49:29.730 --> 00:49:41.190
Aruna S M: Is it still happening I don't have an answer for that, in terms of priorities, since we're not seeing it anymore, when we should take it up some time but maybe not as a priority at this present.

372
00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:46.980
Jim Zhang: yeah I feel like this is more on a case by case basis, I can think of, you know.

373
00:49:48.150 --> 00:49:59.760
Jim Zhang: I don't, mind you know, giving this example because I think is public knowledge, the split between is hearing and mean that and if you're in classic right that's probably a good example of.

374
00:50:00.840 --> 00:50:10.440
Jim Zhang: A Community splitting to quite quite independent code base because of their their parties and philosophies.

375
00:50:13.050 --> 00:50:31.560
Jim Zhang: Sometimes it's it's not necessarily a good thing, sometimes maybe it is a good thing to allow that different approaches to to become different communities, so I I feel like this should be evaluated on a case by case basis.

376
00:50:40.980 --> 00:50:47.910
Danno Ferrin: On the Amina classic split I think it's a bit more nuanced than that, but basically classics become a downstream distribution of maintenance.

377
00:50:48.390 --> 00:51:03.120
Danno Ferrin: So that's another way that communities by split one might stop being you know, the main one and mine might become a downstream and just do what they want, on top of it, because you know the Kobe says split all the code for the most part flows from a network in the classic work.

378
00:51:04.980 --> 00:51:05.850
Jim Zhang: yeah I agree.

379
00:51:06.540 --> 00:51:12.300
Jim Zhang: majority of the enhancements still applies to both code base yeah definitely.

380
00:51:17.460 --> 00:51:21.360
Hart Montgomery: I mean, I think, communities could split for totally benign reasons to that are.

381
00:51:21.450 --> 00:51:35.820
Hart Montgomery: they're actually quite good right, I mean like you know essentially right sort of indie Forked off both areas and ursa right, and I think those were both positive forks right, it was hey here's this component.

382
00:51:37.050 --> 00:51:43.290
Hart Montgomery: You know we're using it, but other people want to use it to what you know people that don't want to use sort of our main.

383
00:51:43.710 --> 00:51:56.310
Hart Montgomery: thing why don't we work it off so it's easier for them to use right, I think you know those were you know I think certainly positive examples of of projects, putting off right.

384
00:51:57.360 --> 00:51:57.990
Jim Zhang: yeah.

385
00:52:04.710 --> 00:52:08.670
Nathan George: Well, in some sense that's what gets that the thing that's hard to measure here, which is.

386
00:52:09.330 --> 00:52:20.130
Nathan George: A project needs to be friendly enough to new ideas, so that those new ideas can incubate within the project as opposed to having to create their own new space outside of hyper ledger to explore that.

387
00:52:20.580 --> 00:52:35.730
Nathan George: That new or interesting idea right because it's that's the paradox of open source is that the easier, you are to fork within your project, the less likely someone will have to make a new venue or a new Community in order to explore their idea and what we're trying to get at here is.

388
00:52:37.290 --> 00:52:48.960
Nathan George: Is there's that kind of conflict or sheer that makes people want to leave, or is there that kind of collaboration and friendliness that makes people want to say, I disagree with you, but I want you to watch and see if i'm doing something dangerous tell me.

389
00:52:58.200 --> 00:53:06.810
Jim Zhang: yeah definitely agree there, so I put that under friendliness to new contributors or new ideas.

390
00:53:22.050 --> 00:53:29.520
Jim Zhang: Any other big ideas, I guess, we have one more minute, and then we should wrap up and give the floor back to Tracy.

391
00:53:32.670 --> 00:53:33.240
Jim Zhang: So.

392
00:53:36.570 --> 00:53:45.840
Jim Zhang: We probably should talk about the the cadence of the call I guess i'll model, the other task forces to have one off cycle call.

393
00:53:50.250 --> 00:53:51.390
Jim Zhang: Probably should.

394
00:53:52.590 --> 00:53:56.430
Jim Zhang: Self organize to decide on the the timing of that.

395
00:53:59.490 --> 00:54:01.470
Jim Zhang: Through discord.

396
00:54:07.140 --> 00:54:13.350
Jim Zhang: cool so I guess right, you would have to create that channel for us right.

397
00:54:15.030 --> 00:54:15.990
Jim Zhang: That has for us.

398
00:54:17.220 --> 00:54:21.690
Ry Jones: That that ability has been delegated to all Members with the tlc role.

399

406
00:54:43.800 --> 00:54:55.620
Jim Zhang: Those who are interested to continue the discussion on a off cycle call schedule and then we can go from there appreciate everybody's input today and.

407
00:54:56.730 --> 00:54:58.170
Jim Zhang: give it back to you Tracy.

408
00:54:59.730 --> 00:55:02.580
Tracy Kuhrt: Alright, thanks, Jim thanks for taking us through this.

Tracy Kuhrt: Next week the things that I know that are going to be on the agenda are.

410
00:55:12.240 --> 00:55:17.400
Tracy Kuhrt: they're just all slipped my mind, they were right there another gun so that pull request from Dan oh.

411
00:55:18.420 --> 00:55:36.240
Tracy Kuhrt: The review of fabric and then I think we're back to the beginning of the task forces so we'll be talking about project families next week, so if you have any additional input on the project families that you haven't added to any of the wiki pages, or the word document, please do that.

412
00:55:37.770 --> 00:55:47.580
Tracy Kuhrt: And we'll make sure that we can continue that discussion next week so with that i'm going to close the call so thanks for attending today.
