00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:21.169
Tracy Kuhrt: Welcome everybody to the December, the eighth Hyper Ledger Technical Oversight Committee call.

2
00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:30.900
Tracy Kuhrt: as everyone who's on this call is aware of 2 things that we must abide by. The first is the antitrust policy. Notice that it is currently displayed on the screen.

3
00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:36.399
Tracy Kuhrt: and the second is our code of conduct which is link in the agenda.

4
00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:46.109
Tracy Kuhrt: All right. So for our agenda today we have the standard announcement: the Deaf Weekly Developer Newsletter goes out each Friday.

5
00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:55.650
Tracy Kuhrt: if you would like to include anything in that newsletter, please leave a comment for consideration at the link that is, in the agenda

6
00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:01.500
Tracy Kuhrt: as far as meetings for the holidays. I thought we should probably cancel

7
00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:12.120
Tracy Kuhrt: the 20Â s, the 20 ninth, and the fifth to make sure that everybody who is on holiday I can enjoy those holidays and not have to worry about the technical oversight committee. Call

8
00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:25.219
Tracy Kuhrt: I'm not sure whether we'll have content for next week, and we'll decide that next week as to whether or not we have one next week. But I definitely for the the holidays. I'd like to make sure that we cancel those meetings

9
00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.180
Tracy Kuhrt: any other announcements that anybody on the call has

10
00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:39.480
Tracy Kuhrt: a root.

11
00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:48.589
Arun S M: This so this is regarding Hyper ledger, blockchain, Explorer Project, which was recently deprecated or end of life cycle, I guess.

12
00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.690
Arun S M: And there has been interest in multiple

13
00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:56.450
Arun S M: among multiple community members. So it is going to be

14
00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.839
Arun S M: like people are looking into adding certain features to that project, and seeing

15
00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:06.990
Arun S M: and further improving the project and bringing it back to life. So there is going to be a

16
00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.660
Arun S M: discussion tomorrow.

17
00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:10.140
Arun S M: Hey? Damn

18
00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:11.220
Arun S M: Eastern time!

19
00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:22.000
Tracy Kuhrt: And the calendar link is where, exactly for people who might be interested in joining that

20
00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:27.109
Arun S M: right. I need to work with David and getting it up on the calendar link.

21
00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.089
Tracy Kuhrt: Okay.

22
00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.100
Tracy Kuhrt: Okay? And then yeah,

23
00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:42.830
Tracy Kuhrt: I think if I understand correctly that the the code base has been moved to the Labs area. So it's currently a a lab in that project.

24
00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:49.830
Tracy Kuhrt: and if that would like to come back to be a top level project at some point in the future it will have to go through the

25
00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.790
Tracy Kuhrt: project. Proposal process.

26
00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:54.120
Arun S M: Agree.

27
00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:54.730
Yup.

28
00:03:55.270 --> 00:04:01.480
Arun S M: Okay. So if you know of anybody else who is interested in the project. Please bring them to the call tomorrow.

29
00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:02.050
Yeah.

30
00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:04.810
Tracy Kuhrt: alright, thanks.

31
00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:08.240
Tracy Kuhrt: Any other announcements that anybody would like to make.

32
00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:19.140
Tracy Kuhrt: I don't see any hands.

33
00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:27.850
Tracy Kuhrt: Nobody coming off mute, so i'll take that, as they know, as far as quarterly reports. We did have the cello report come in

34
00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:29.310
Tracy Kuhrt: this week.

35
00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:31.739
Tracy Kuhrt: I did not see

36
00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:40.570
Tracy Kuhrt: any comments on that. I'm just opening it now, just to make sure that nothing new has come in overnight that I may have this.

37
00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:48.750
Tracy Kuhrt: no, it looks like the only comment here is from from David Boswell. about

38
00:04:49.410 --> 00:05:09.110
Tracy Kuhrt: social media post and marketing for the one release that's coming out. Looks like we still do have a number of Toc members that have yet to review the document. So we'll you know, book to see if there's anything that comes out there. Any questions, though, that anybody does have from that particular

39
00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:12.059
Tracy Kuhrt: project, report the cello project report.

40
00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:23.709
Jim Zhang: Hey, Tracy? I I did have a question on the documentation

41
00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:35.560
Jim Zhang: and the like. There of was the same comments from their last report. I still didn't see much update in that in that area. So I just putting another comment in there.

42
00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:46.750
Tracy Kuhrt: Okay, and it's that there needs to be more documentation for the cello project. Do you think, before the the one that releases what you're asking for?

43
00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:54.860
Jim Zhang: Yeah, yeah, what what thing there is completely lacking. If i'm a newcomer trying to pick up travel, I just can't figure out anything.

44
00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:56.580
Tracy Kuhrt: Okay.

45
00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:14.650
Tracy Kuhrt: probably. Have you in the learning materials working group. Has anybody been working with the cello folks on

46
00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:19.240
Tracy Kuhrt: any sort of documentation or anything there? Has that come up or not?

47
00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:32.430
Bobbi Muscara: no, it hasn't but David and I had a meeting this week about how we're going to change learning materials, working group to help support that more with a task force, and one of them will be that documentation task force.

48
00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:33.370
Tracy Kuhrt: Okay.

49
00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:36.719
Tracy Kuhrt: alright thanks, Bobby

50
00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:57.189
Bobbi Muscara: didn't need to put you on the spot there, but I I know you had helped some other projects in the past. I didn't know this one was one that had come up or not. No, but that documentation working group was going to support all those efforts to make it simple and work together with us to help them attain the documentation they need to get newcomers on boarding easily.

51
00:06:57.660 --> 00:06:58.400
Tracy Kuhrt: Okay.

52
00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:03.069
Tracy Kuhrt: and Jim when we get there. This might be a

53
00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:06.770
Tracy Kuhrt: a best practice that we want to add to the checklist.

54
00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:10.610
Tracy Kuhrt: As we are thinking about documentation.

55
00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:17.099
Jim Zhang: Yeah, it it was kind of my my my subtle way to say

56
00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:23.030
Jim Zhang: they need to really drastically improve documentation to declare one.

57
00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:24.320
Tracy Kuhrt: Yeah.

58
00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:25.480
Tracy Kuhrt: okay, okay.

59
00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:31.920
Bobbi Muscara: I'll reach out folks this week and set something up to get started.

60
00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:34.130
Jim Zhang: Yeah, I appreciate it, Bobby.

61
00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:36.470
Tracy Kuhrt: That's great. Thanks. Probably

62
00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:41.640
Tracy Kuhrt: all right any other comments about cello At this point

63
00:07:47.010 --> 00:07:58.150
Tracy Kuhrt: alright, I will note that the Firefly also did come in early this week. So I did include the link there on the agenda. We'll definitely include it next time

64
00:07:58.290 --> 00:08:01.650
Tracy Kuhrt: as well. But just a yi! That one did come in

65
00:08:01.770 --> 00:08:05.340
Tracy Kuhrt: if you Haven't had a chance to look at it yet. Please do so.

66
00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:18.620
Tracy Kuhrt: And I guess I can ask the question because it does look like a a good number of people have already taken a look at that. Are there any comments or questions about the Firefly report at this point

67
00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:32.150
Tracy Kuhrt: alright, resounding now.

68
00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:42.800
Tracy Kuhrt: So so last week we had talked about a couple of things one we had talked about the different task forces and closing those out

69
00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:47.749
Tracy Kuhrt: and one of the items that came up when we were talking about the project Help

70
00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:49.310
Tracy Kuhrt: task force was

71
00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:53.030
Tracy Kuhrt: potentially creating a checklist where we would move some of the

72
00:08:53.120 --> 00:09:00.429
Tracy Kuhrt: questions that we have in the project reports to some sort of spreadsheet and maybe try to include some of the project. Health

73
00:09:00.590 --> 00:09:04.380
Tracy Kuhrt: type things into this particular

74
00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:06.810
Tracy Kuhrt: sort of

75
00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:12.040
Tracy Kuhrt: checklist of Yes, no. Do we have these things that are included?

76
00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:17.650
Tracy Kuhrt: I I started this with the list of the things that we have done in the past.

77
00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:34.039
Tracy Kuhrt: in the past year, right? We've created the common repository structure we've created the maintain our guidelines, and we've approved the inclusive naming proposal. And so I basically included all of the items from the there, Whether or not they were, must or should.

78
00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:38.559
Tracy Kuhrt: They are included here. for most of these I

79
00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:45.919
Tracy Kuhrt: specified whether they were required or recommend it. but not all of them. maybe I need to go back and do that for the ones I missed.

80
00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:55.279
Tracy Kuhrt: there. But, you know these these items. None of them should surprise us, as we have approved these things in the past.

81
00:09:55.470 --> 00:10:01.039
Tracy Kuhrt: but I did want to have a discussion and see if there were other things that we should be adding to this list.

82
00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:08.479
Tracy Kuhrt: i'm happy to, you know. Take those notes and and start to add them here. directly in the document.

83
00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:27.660
Tracy Kuhrt: Any thoughts, things that we should add to this list.

84
00:10:37.690 --> 00:10:41.409
David Enyeart: I don't have things to add, but i'll just say I like it.

85
00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:49.429
David Enyeart: and a all in one location is very convenient, and I wish this had existed previously. So.

86
00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:59.410
David Enyeart: it looks like it's pretty inclusive of the things we already have. I can't think of anything new, but I think this would be a good thing going forward, and we'll add to it

87
00:10:59.570 --> 00:11:00.989
David Enyeart: as we think of things.

88
00:11:01.850 --> 00:11:12.810
Tracy Kuhrt: Yeah. And and Dave and others, the what I was thinking here is that we would probably create a separate tab for each of the projects. that would be a copy of this template

89
00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:19.950
Tracy Kuhrt: right, and as we as when we add things to the template, we would also add them to the individual project

90
00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:24.340
Tracy Kuhrt: Tabs, so that again one place to go to to see.

91
00:11:24.370 --> 00:11:34.089
Tracy Kuhrt: you know. do our projects support the best practices? If so, where can you find that? so that it's it's also somewhat of a

92
00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:53.940
Tracy Kuhrt: appendix or an index, I guess, is the right way to say that right? That that basically allows people to quickly find the information, so that if they're interested in, say, becoming a maintainer of one of the projects they can go find out. What? How, what does that take? And how do I, how do I become a maintainer? What are the steps I have to go through?

93
00:11:53.970 --> 00:11:58.469
Tracy Kuhrt: so yeah, I think that's kind of the idea here.

94
00:11:59.120 --> 00:11:59.980
Tracy Kuhrt: Peter.

95
00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:09.250
Peter Somogyvari: quick suggestion that i'm ever made a change to. This will be okay if

96
00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:10.579
Peter Somogyvari: I move

97
00:12:10.770 --> 00:12:13.990
Peter Somogyvari: It's the the

98
00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:18.150
Peter Somogyvari: information into its own column. So let's feel tripled by it.

99
00:12:19.450 --> 00:12:21.570
Tracy Kuhrt: sure. Yeah, we can definitely do that.

100
00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:23.490
Okay?

101
00:12:23.790 --> 00:12:29.669
Peter Somogyvari: And then once I do that, i'll have a few ideas for optional stuff, but nothing to add on the required

102
00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:30.560
Peter Somogyvari: from

103
00:12:31.390 --> 00:12:32.090
Tracy Kuhrt: Okay.

104
00:12:39.530 --> 00:12:44.139
Kamlesh Nagware: So I think maybe information about the Lts releases

105
00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:46.590
Kamlesh Nagware: It' be added.

106
00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:49.879
Kamlesh Nagware: And the other thing I even

107
00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:53.440
Kamlesh Nagware: couple of open source project I have seen so

108
00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:56.960
about the

109
00:12:57.250 --> 00:12:58.300
Kamlesh Nagware: Okay. Now.

110
00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:06.029
Kamlesh Nagware: the project implementation, like it was the real time on the production implementation of the particular open source project.

111
00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:11.020
Tracy Kuhrt: So

112
00:13:11.050 --> 00:13:16.549
Tracy Kuhrt: do you have a list of

113
00:13:16.690 --> 00:13:22.160
Kamlesh Nagware: Yeah. Yeah. So so like, for example, if you see any for them, I suppose if you go to any open source projects

114
00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:24.369
Kamlesh Nagware: they mentioned about like who are using

115
00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:25.759
Kamlesh Nagware: this particular project

116
00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:29.280
Kamlesh Nagware: Wouldn't: be.

117
00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:30.110
Tracy Kuhrt: Yeah.

118
00:13:31.590 --> 00:13:41.460
Tracy Kuhrt: Okay, sean. If you scroll down, I am editing, as we speak. So yeah, at the bottom, I added this question: do you have a list of production? Uses

119
00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:44.900
Tracy Kuhrt: to the the document.

120
00:13:44.930 --> 00:13:45.830
Tracy Kuhrt: the camel

121
00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:51.410
Tracy Kuhrt: I also added, your Lts release piece as well on line 25.

122
00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:56.440
Tracy Kuhrt: All right, are you?

123
00:13:58.100 --> 00:14:04.689
Arnaud J Le Hors ("Arno"): Yes, hi! I mean I see what's been said before. This would be great to have, for sure it feels like

124
00:14:05.730 --> 00:14:10.239
Arnaud J Le Hors ("Arno"): I wish you could populate some of this automatically. But,

125
00:14:10.290 --> 00:14:15.900
Arnaud J Le Hors ("Arno"): my question really is, how do you deal with the fact that many projects, if not all.

126
00:14:16.130 --> 00:14:18.600
Arnaud J Le Hors ("Arno"): have multiple repositories?

127
00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:23.330
Arnaud J Le Hors ("Arno"): Are we going to just focus on the main one or

128
00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:34.920
Tracy Kuhrt: good question, Arnold. I have that same question in my head, and I don't know a good answer to that. I really appreciate thoughts here. Right?

129
00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:38.119
Tracy Kuhrt: I I mean in my mind, there's

130
00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:42.149
Tracy Kuhrt: 2 ways that come to my mind of how we can deal with this

131
00:14:42.190 --> 00:14:48.939
Tracy Kuhrt: one is that we have a separate tab for each repo. I think this is going to make this a very long spreadsheet.

132
00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:52.939
Tracy Kuhrt: and that that may be too overwhelming for people.

133
00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:59.569
Tracy Kuhrt: maybe I have a third way. We could create a separate one for each project, and then have repo

134
00:15:00.510 --> 00:15:04.399
Tracy Kuhrt: specific questions and project-specific questions. Right?

135
00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:11.870
Tracy Kuhrt: we could the the third option, which was my original second option was, we do it for project.

136
00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:17.290
Tracy Kuhrt: and in the location column we have multiple locations, one for each repo.

137
00:15:17.490 --> 00:15:21.740
Tracy Kuhrt: so yeah, I think those are the 3 that come to mind. But i'm like

138
00:15:22.210 --> 00:15:30.190
Tracy Kuhrt: would love to hear your thoughts on what you think is best. And if there's a fourth or fifth option that might be better.

139
00:15:31.690 --> 00:15:32.480
Yeah, I mean, I

140
00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:41.410
Arnaud J Le Hors ("Arno"): So I don't claim to have the right answer. Either. That's why I bought it that it it crossed my mind, I think you know, practically speaking.

141
00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:45.999
Arnaud J Le Hors ("Arno"): at least as a first step focusing on the main repository.

142
00:15:46.170 --> 00:15:47.600
Arnaud J Le Hors ("Arno"): It seems like you are reasonable

143
00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:48.570
Arnaud J Le Hors ("Arno"): thing to do.

144
00:15:48.610 --> 00:15:51.659
Arnaud J Le Hors ("Arno"): I think otherwise. It's getting very quickly overwhelmed.

145
00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:56.530
Arnaud J Le Hors ("Arno"): I think it's better to

146
00:15:56.750 --> 00:16:05.489
Arnaud J Le Hors ("Arno"): less information that that we can keep, you know, accurate. Keep it up to date. Then trying to encompass everything, and then

147
00:16:05.750 --> 00:16:10.769
Arnaud J Le Hors ("Arno"): you know it's going to become obsolete before you know. And then it. This is the whole

148
00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:11.820
Arnaud J Le Hors ("Arno"): purpose.

149
00:16:14.930 --> 00:16:20.329
Arnaud J Le Hors ("Arno"): noting how people use these. So they're aware.

150
00:16:20.470 --> 00:16:22.370
Arnaud J Le Hors ("Arno"): And maybe

151
00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:27.019
Arnaud J Le Hors ("Arno"): maybe there's something that needs to be done at the project. They've also that

152
00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:28.250
Arnaud J Le Hors ("Arno"): you know.

153
00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:30.109
Arnaud J Le Hors ("Arno"): I see

154
00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:34.029
Arnaud J Le Hors ("Arno"): I i'm taking the outlook, so I will join.

155
00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:36.310
Arnaud J Le Hors ("Arno"): But

156
00:16:36.750 --> 00:16:43.479
Arnaud J Le Hors ("Arno"): you know, I wonder if it's up to the project to point to the the repo, and that provide additional information

157
00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:49.629
Arnaud J Le Hors ("Arno"): to some degree. You can see this out by just the name. Usually you can find that out.

158
00:16:50.290 --> 00:16:51.590
Arnaud J Le Hors ("Arno"): Maybe more can be done.

159
00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:53.140
Arnaud J Le Hors ("Arno"): There you go

160
00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:54.950
Arnaud J Le Hors ("Arno"): of the project tomorrow.

161
00:16:57.070 --> 00:16:58.689
Tracy Kuhrt: Yeah. And and

162
00:16:58.970 --> 00:17:05.460
Tracy Kuhrt: I don't know, because you've said that I guess a fourth option that has just now come to mind is.

163
00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:08.189
Tracy Kuhrt: what if we required this in the reading

164
00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.539
Tracy Kuhrt: for each of the repost.

165
00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:14.700
Tracy Kuhrt: or it

166
00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:16.869
Tracy Kuhrt: pointer to this from the remaining

167
00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:18.900
we're basically

168
00:17:19.069 --> 00:17:25.829
Tracy Kuhrt: The information existed as an index to the project, so that people knew where to find things within that particular repo.

169
00:17:30.970 --> 00:17:32.769
Tracy Kuhrt: okay, a room.

170
00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:44.980
Arun S M: hey? Thanks, Tracy. So I was looking through this list, and thanks for aggregating in one place. I am. I like it to be in one place now that I say this least.

171
00:17:45.410 --> 00:17:49.690
Arun S M: So thinking of some of the bigger projects are some of the projects that have wider scope

172
00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:54.249
Arun S M: it, it could be as simple as, for instance, let's say, for example, for instance.

173
00:17:54.410 --> 00:17:58.310
Arun S M: a a repository that may get contributions from multiple

174
00:17:58.450 --> 00:17:59.220
Arun S M: folks

175
00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:04.250
Arun S M: in each interested in some aspect of it some few folks interested in

176
00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:07.290
Arun S M: on the let's say, bringing up of a Testament.

177
00:18:07.370 --> 00:18:12.769
Arun S M: whereas few of them could be interested in writing samples on the chain code different languages

178
00:18:13.750 --> 00:18:14.760
Arun S M: having.

179
00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:17.979
Arun S M: I know, like private team is doing good job, but

180
00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:19.679
Arun S M: maybe we can recommend

181
00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:22.760
Arun S M: another file called something like owners

182
00:18:22.930 --> 00:18:26.810
Arun S M: which the chromium, like defined earlier.

183
00:18:26.950 --> 00:18:30.770
Arun S M: which allows us to define older level ownership right?

184
00:18:30.930 --> 00:18:39.259
Arun S M: We can say that there can be reviewers and reviewers can who specializes on that particular field, or that either it could be that part of

185
00:18:39.850 --> 00:18:43.959
Arun S M: I mean that folder of a project, or in that part of a project.

186
00:18:44.150 --> 00:18:47.889
Arun S M: and then approval is only when they approve. It goes into

187
00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:50.529
Arun S M: the main base.

188
00:18:53.670 --> 00:18:54.980
Tracy Kuhrt: Yup.

189
00:18:55.250 --> 00:18:59.990
Tracy Kuhrt: and that would be an Owner's file would be recommended, I think right?

190
00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:04.249
Arun S M: Right? It's not a mandate. it it. Yeah, I command it.

191
00:19:04.410 --> 00:19:05.120
Yeah.

192
00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:06.060
Tracy Kuhrt: Okay.

193
00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:21.109
Kamlesh Nagware: So I think like, i'm not just point right there. There are multiple projections of projects. Maybe we can also have we having a list of some projects.

194
00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:27.310
Kamlesh Nagware: so it will easily be identifiable to the people like with project related to which

195
00:19:27.590 --> 00:19:28.810
Kamlesh Nagware: particular repose.

196
00:19:31.290 --> 00:19:35.649
Kamlesh Nagware: So, for example, I'm. Supposed to the fabric having a multiple of it, could be included in the

197
00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:37.860
Kamlesh Nagware: A in the

198
00:19:50.970 --> 00:19:53.740
Tracy Kuhrt: Okay.

199
00:19:54.480 --> 00:20:14.320
Nathan George: on this sheet it seems like it's important for us to to to call out, but most of these are required on a per repo basis. Even if you try to save energy, you still have to have something there for either a legal compliance, reason, or because, if it's not there You're probably not doing. The activity in indicates like doing the testing or

200
00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:22.440
Nathan George: implementing the conventions. And so you know, one of the hopes is that as we get our lymph linting tool

201
00:20:23.230 --> 00:20:31.979
Nathan George: kept up to speed, is it? It's very easy for us to to run this against the repositories and get a picture overall of where the project is at

202
00:20:32.060 --> 00:20:49.759
Nathan George: because they there there is going to be a constant struggle to keep some of these things up to date. And one of the things that's important when project decides to make lots of sub repositories is that they understand upfront what they're signing up for. because I think one of the things that happens is often the sub project is kind of a matter of maintainer convenience.

203
00:20:49.850 --> 00:21:04.129
Nathan George: or it's a matter of you know it. It's just more easier to use the pro the programming language tools. If I don't have to worry about more than one programming language in the same repo. and they don't realize all of these things. end up duplicated as a result.

204
00:21:14.780 --> 00:21:23.080
Tracy Kuhrt: I agree, i'm not sure what specific change, if any we need to make to this to reflect that

205
00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:24.070
Tracy Kuhrt: me, too.

206
00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:31.839
Nathan George: I just wondered if in required and recommended if there's something we can call out about whether they can link or whether they have to duplicate the content

207
00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:42.840
Nathan George: Couple of these we could probably just link from one to the other, and I know we've had that debate at Nauseum and the repository structure and the Maintainer guidelines. So it may be that just the content that's in that linked document is enough.

208
00:21:45.830 --> 00:21:50.140
Tracy Kuhrt: Yeah. completely understood. I think.

209
00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:56.419
Tracy Kuhrt: if I remember correctly, and we'd have to open it. but I think in the

210
00:21:56.860 --> 00:21:59.950
let me see if I can open it here and just take a look at it.

211
00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:06.999
Tracy Kuhrt: I think in the Maintainer's guidelines we have.

212
00:22:09.150 --> 00:22:15.150
Tracy Kuhrt: Was it? The Maintainer's got. My, no, it was the common repository structure and the common repository structure. We do have

213
00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:18.439
Tracy Kuhrt: a comment I remember about

214
00:22:18.570 --> 00:22:26.970
Tracy Kuhrt: these files must contain specific comment. it's specific content. so I think the license, the code of conduct and the security

215
00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:32.339
Tracy Kuhrt: are the 3 that we list as must requires a specific content.

216
00:22:32.470 --> 00:22:34.299
Tracy Kuhrt: is that

217
00:22:34.710 --> 00:22:41.200
Tracy Kuhrt: is that what we should be marking then is those 3 as these require specific content?

218
00:22:41.430 --> 00:22:44.929
Tracy Kuhrt: and then the other files are the variable content ones.

219
00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:48.990
Nathan George: Yeah, I just wonder if where we say for you. File required

220
00:22:49.070 --> 00:22:56.949
Nathan George: we we could put a note in this in this list. It's just. It's really nice as a maintainer to have something like this spreadsheet where I can just go.

221
00:22:57.310 --> 00:23:04.210
Nathan George: but just go through and make sure each thing is is ready to go, because it makes the pull request a lot easier to follow if I

222
00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:06.289
Nathan George: can get them all through at the same time.

223
00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:10.140
Tracy Kuhrt: Yeah, yeah, it is the

224
00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:16.620
Tracy Kuhrt: security. I just said I'm.

225
00:23:17.590 --> 00:23:25.550
Tracy Kuhrt: and my brain obviously is not awake yet. This one security, license and current contact that are the the ones that are special.

226
00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:34.800
Tracy Kuhrt: Maybe maybe the reason that my brain is not able to keep those in my head is because

227
00:23:34.850 --> 00:23:38.050
Tracy Kuhrt: a security and license where is the code of conduct? Here we go.

228
00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:41.380
Tracy Kuhrt: so these 3 are the ones that are special, If you will.

229
00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:44.739
Tracy Kuhrt: I'm. Just gonna mark them. Highlight them in some way. So

230
00:23:45.050 --> 00:23:47.949
Tracy Kuhrt: we remember that we need to do something special with these.

231
00:23:50.190 --> 00:23:53.820
Tracy Kuhrt: Okay, thank you, Nathan, for that.

232
00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:57.030
Tracy Kuhrt: I will make sure to do that

233
00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:11.099
Tracy Kuhrt: any other comments anything else we should add. Jim, I feel like what I want to add around documentation is

234
00:24:12.420 --> 00:24:15.550
Tracy Kuhrt: something like. Do you have tutorials

235
00:24:16.740 --> 00:24:28.549
Tracy Kuhrt: on use to reflect kind of the comment you made about the cello one? Are there other sorts of documentation that people think is extremely important to make sure that

236
00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:30.869
Tracy Kuhrt: that exists for our projects.

237
00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:45.660
Jim Zhang: Yeah, I'm kind of torn a little bit here. I I feel like a a active project will naturally have good documentation, because that's the only way to get the community

238
00:24:45.790 --> 00:24:49.349
Jim Zhang: to be able to pick it up and use it.

239
00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:59.429
Jim Zhang: if it If If your project is lacking basic documentation, it's a sign that nobody cares about it.

240
00:24:59.980 --> 00:25:05.360
Jim Zhang: so that's that's kind of what's in my head. So

241
00:25:05.670 --> 00:25:16.079
Jim Zhang: maybe we can say best practices is having good documentation. But really, if you don't have that, how can you be? the effective project?

242
00:25:19.490 --> 00:25:22.220
Tracy Kuhrt: Yeah. So I added,

243
00:25:22.490 --> 00:25:25.289
Tracy Kuhrt: okay, I obviously have no idea how these sheets.

244
00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:35.939
Tracy Kuhrt: I added, do you have documentation as one right? It's very possible that some of our projects that are in incubation. Haven't gotten to the documentation yet, so that will end up being a no

245
00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:42.209
Tracy Kuhrt: And then I added the second question of tutorials on use.

246
00:25:43.260 --> 00:25:45.790
Tracy Kuhrt: I I want to.

247
00:25:47.230 --> 00:25:53.119
Tracy Kuhrt: I want to avoid the use of the word good, because it's very subjective. What good means.

248
00:25:53.250 --> 00:26:00.770
Tracy Kuhrt: and i'd like to be more specific if we could. If If there's other things that we think are necessary in the documentation

249
00:26:00.900 --> 00:26:04.139
Tracy Kuhrt: that would make it good in our mind.

250
00:26:04.270 --> 00:26:07.949
Tracy Kuhrt: right. what what does that really mean to us?

251
00:26:13.150 --> 00:26:14.090
Tracy Kuhrt: So all right.

252
00:26:17.490 --> 00:26:20.229
Arun S M: yeah, maybe i'm overlooking it. but

253
00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:27.399
Arun S M: I feel like as a developer when I first time see any of the code bases i'm like, unless I know the code base.

254
00:26:27.690 --> 00:26:33.200
Arun S M: I may be interested in knowing how to build it locally how to test it of my test environment.

255
00:26:33.930 --> 00:26:36.440
Arun S M: So I know there is a testing code

256
00:26:36.730 --> 00:26:39.260
Arun S M: point which is put as recommended.

257
00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:40.320
Arun S M: I'm.

258
00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:44.279
Arun S M: I'm. Just not sure if it considers the build and test

259
00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:46.079
Arun S M: if that's what it meant to be.

260
00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:53.630
Arun S M: It's like that in this row number 19.

261
00:26:54.050 --> 00:26:55.699
Tracy Kuhrt: Yeah, no,

262
00:26:56.130 --> 00:27:04.120
Tracy Kuhrt: that is truly testing code. So I added lines 31 and 32 here. do you have

263
00:27:04.310 --> 00:27:07.639
Tracy Kuhrt: build instructions, probably in your documentation.

264
00:27:07.850 --> 00:27:10.229
Tracy Kuhrt: and then

265
00:27:10.410 --> 00:27:12.040
Tracy Kuhrt: the second one.

266
00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:16.640
Tracy Kuhrt: Do you have documentation to help a contributor understand the code base?

267
00:27:16.970 --> 00:27:19.780
Tracy Kuhrt: I think that's what you're asking for. Is it a room.

268
00:27:20.270 --> 00:27:26.940
Arun S M: Sure maybe not the code base at least to build instructions, if possible, because there could be let's say

269
00:27:27.460 --> 00:27:31.250
Arun S M: some of them. Some of the projects would be using, make, find some of them could be using

270
00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:33.940
Arun S M: a rest place is once i'm

271
00:27:34.070 --> 00:27:41.190
Arun S M: they could have multiple flags in there, and as a first time contributor. I may understand how the programming language works.

272
00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:44.339
Arun S M: but I may not be able to comprehend the the

273
00:27:44.940 --> 00:27:48.370
Arun S M: multiple options which are provided in in those files

274
00:27:48.550 --> 00:27:54.810
Arun S M: unless I know about the project right? So maybe they should be an option. So if you are a development, if you are building

275
00:27:55.390 --> 00:27:59.570
Arun S M: if you are contributing, and here is how you can build locally.

276
00:27:59.630 --> 00:28:03.669
Arun S M: It allows you us to gain confidence that you have tested.

277
00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:05.589
Arun S M: and it gives you confidence that

278
00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:07.070
Arun S M: you are able to build it.

279
00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:07.970
Tracy Kuhrt: Yep.

280
00:28:09.030 --> 00:28:09.730
Tracy Kuhrt: Okay.

281
00:28:11.150 --> 00:28:11.880
Tracy Kuhrt: Poppy.

282
00:28:13.110 --> 00:28:24.230
Bobbi Muscara: So with the documentation task force our goal and hopefully will be finished by the end of the year is to get some recommendations for projects and incubation to take their Github repositories and put them through

283
00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:41.589
Bobbi Muscara: these templates and have user docs. And again. I completely agree with everyone who said that the documentation is direct. Reflect on how the project is loved. So, depending on how much work went into describing steps in the Github is is

284
00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:52.890
Bobbi Muscara: as good as your documentation when you say the only thing that I have a question on is when you say, you are more talking about how to tutorials.

285
00:28:52.910 --> 00:29:04.109
Bobbi Muscara: I'm not sure how you could get the community all to do that in a uniform way unless you supply a template that each project has to do for that specific reason.

286
00:29:06.650 --> 00:29:10.370
Tracy Kuhrt: Yeah, I I think that tutorials are going to be very dependent on

287
00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:20.289
Tracy Kuhrt: the project at hand. Right? I think it's important to have those tutorials. But I don't think it's necessary to reflect what type of tutorials, if you will.

288
00:29:30.170 --> 00:29:32.280
Tracy Kuhrt: Okay? Other thoughts.

289
00:29:56.960 --> 00:29:57.710
Tracy Kuhrt: Alright.

290
00:29:58.750 --> 00:30:02.890
Arun S M: Yeah. I know. I'm not supposed to use the check here by type.

291
00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:06.830
Arun S M: I could. I just wanted to paste the link. So this is

292
00:30:07.060 --> 00:30:09.580
Arun S M: some kind of documentation that I was

293
00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:10.570
Arun S M: talking about.

294
00:30:11.060 --> 00:30:13.659
Arun S M: Personally, this benefited me when

295
00:30:13.890 --> 00:30:17.809
Arun S M: I mean long back when I started contributing to this project.

296
00:30:30.820 --> 00:30:31.440
Tracy Kuhrt: Okay.

297
00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:42.010
Tracy Kuhrt: Any other

298
00:30:44.750 --> 00:30:47.799
Tracy Kuhrt: thoughts, anything else we should add to this

299
00:31:10.090 --> 00:31:11.590
Tracy Kuhrt: Peter the

300
00:31:11.780 --> 00:31:16.499
Tracy Kuhrt: the column you requested the required recommended is this kind of the idea that you had there.

301
00:31:20.140 --> 00:31:21.179
Peter Somogyvari: Yeah, that works

302
00:31:22.940 --> 00:31:23.959
Tracy Kuhrt: that works.

303
00:31:24.190 --> 00:31:27.919
Tracy Kuhrt: You had something else in my

304
00:31:29.060 --> 00:31:32.510
Peter Somogyvari: my first idea will be slightly different.

305
00:31:32.620 --> 00:31:33.640
Peter Somogyvari: But

306
00:31:33.790 --> 00:31:39.299
Peter Somogyvari: this is perfect. It it serves the purpose. It's a it makes the data structural

307
00:31:39.430 --> 00:31:40.699
Peter Somogyvari: just the same way.

308
00:31:42.420 --> 00:31:45.890
Peter Somogyvari: So it wasn't it wasn't a job

309
00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:46.790
good.

310
00:31:47.020 --> 00:31:47.860
Tracy Kuhrt: thanks to either.

311
00:31:54.740 --> 00:32:04.550
Tracy Kuhrt: alright, so i'll clean this up a bit. I think you know some of these other things that we had that our mark jet as recorded recommended.

312
00:32:04.660 --> 00:32:10.639
Tracy Kuhrt: i'll check the whatever we document it when we document it, say the maintenance guidelines or the

313
00:32:10.750 --> 00:32:14.989
Tracy Kuhrt: common repository structure, and make sure that they

314
00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:18.419
Tracy Kuhrt: have, whether or not it's a required or recommended

315
00:32:18.550 --> 00:32:29.479
Tracy Kuhrt: some of these new things that we just added, i'm i'm guessing these are all recommended practices, since we just kind of added them. they weren't things that we thought were necessarily required.

316
00:32:29.530 --> 00:32:34.760
Tracy Kuhrt: but happy to to be told that you think something should be required. If

317
00:32:34.890 --> 00:32:36.010
Tracy Kuhrt: if it should be

318
00:32:49.990 --> 00:32:54.510
Tracy Kuhrt: okay, so for the moment i'll make them all recommend it.

319
00:32:56.130 --> 00:33:02.690
Tracy Kuhrt: And then, if for some reason, at some point in the future we decide that they should be required. We can have that discussion

320
00:33:07.900 --> 00:33:10.979
Tracy Kuhrt: any other thoughts on this before we close this topic.

321
00:33:15.990 --> 00:33:17.830
Peter Somogyvari: so I think it's a great idea.

322
00:33:18.050 --> 00:33:20.309
Peter Somogyvari: Gary thumbs up plus one.

323
00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:32.009
Arnaud J Le Hors ("Arno"): so maybe you said it before, and I it so what's the plan now? I mean, what how do you go at feeling out all this data?

324
00:33:32.670 --> 00:33:34.920
Tracy Kuhrt: Yeah. So

325
00:33:35.490 --> 00:33:45.530
Tracy Kuhrt: Oh, no. I thought I could maybe potentially take a first stab at this by going through for the different projects and marking whether or not they exist, and where I found them.

326
00:33:45.730 --> 00:33:50.330
Tracy Kuhrt: and then anything that's left blank. Turn that over to the

327
00:33:50.350 --> 00:33:54.210
Tracy Kuhrt: the projects to allow them to update it

328
00:33:54.420 --> 00:33:59.539
Tracy Kuhrt: or change it, as the case may be. If if I got it wrong for some reason.

329
00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:05.190
Tracy Kuhrt: Does it sound like a an appropriate next step?

330
00:34:06.490 --> 00:34:23.540
Arnaud J Le Hors ("Arno"): Well, if you're willing to do the work, I don't think it is, you know, Jack, but I think it's a bit unfair. I don't know why you would have to carry the load here. We have people from different projects, even within the Tsc. Alone. I think it should be spread around, so that at least one per

331
00:34:23.550 --> 00:34:28.150
Arnaud J Le Hors ("Arno"): one person for project volunteers to do it for their own project.

332
00:34:29.130 --> 00:34:33.640
Arnaud J Le Hors ("Arno"): and then there may be some that for which we don't have anybody.

333
00:34:35.020 --> 00:34:37.659
Arnaud J Le Hors ("Arno"): Maybe we can

334
00:34:37.870 --> 00:34:43.519
David Enyeart: that would work, or we could just say for the next quarter reports. Please fill out the initial spreadsheet.

335
00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:50.159
Okay.

336
00:34:52.110 --> 00:34:57.840
Tracy Kuhrt: I'm happy to do either way. If somebody wants to volunteer to fill it out. Now, that's great.

337
00:34:58.070 --> 00:35:05.599
Tracy Kuhrt: I'm not going to force anybody to do that. But I I do think yeah, definitely. I want in the next quarterly report.

338
00:35:05.780 --> 00:35:11.399
Tracy Kuhrt: If it hasn't been filled out, or it's partially filled out for the the projects to complete that.

339
00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:19.059
David Enyeart: Tracy, i'll volunteer to do it to do fabrics

340
00:35:19.390 --> 00:35:22.620
David Enyeart: first here. Yeah. So we have a

341
00:35:23.090 --> 00:35:24.339
David Enyeart: precedent.

342
00:35:27.310 --> 00:35:34.170
Tracy Kuhrt: Alright, i'm gonna I'm gonna change that link that I have right now. It's coming, only i'm gonna change it to editor

343
00:35:34.280 --> 00:35:38.790
Tracy Kuhrt: so that anybody can go ahead and edit the the document going forward.

344
00:35:46.900 --> 00:35:49.299
Jim Zhang: So, Tracy, we'll have

345
00:35:51.820 --> 00:35:54.899
Jim Zhang: this as ongoing or just one time

346
00:35:55.620 --> 00:35:57.200
Jim Zhang: capture

347
00:36:00.710 --> 00:36:05.769
Jim Zhang: it zooming. Some projects may not have all of them checked.

348
00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:10.499
Jim Zhang: Do we want them to progress? So eventually they have all of them checks.

349
00:36:11.500 --> 00:36:17.589
Tracy Kuhrt: I I think that would be ideal, Jim, right as we do get to a place where they are all checked.

350
00:36:17.670 --> 00:36:18.620
Tracy Kuhrt: I think it

351
00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:28.399
Tracy Kuhrt: the the more that people and projects. let's say, the the more that projects have checked these, I think the the more advanced they are.

352
00:36:28.460 --> 00:36:32.079
Tracy Kuhrt: I think there's you know, potentially a question of

353
00:36:32.410 --> 00:36:42.320
Tracy Kuhrt: and this was not something I did. But maybe we also want to look at the incubation incubation. Exit criteria and see if there's any other things here that

354
00:36:42.370 --> 00:36:44.749
Tracy Kuhrt: might be good questions to include.

355
00:36:44.920 --> 00:36:53.529
Tracy Kuhrt: that would also tell us where the projects are currently being incubated. Whether or not it's is getting close to to being

356
00:36:53.720 --> 00:36:56.840
Tracy Kuhrt: something that they would request to go active.

357
00:36:57.240 --> 00:37:01.540
Tracy Kuhrt: so yeah, I don't think this is a one time thing. I think

358
00:37:01.870 --> 00:37:06.460
Tracy Kuhrt: you know. The the problem that we have is that once people fill it out, they think they're done.

359
00:37:06.580 --> 00:37:10.359
Tracy Kuhrt: but things change in the projects, right? New repos are added.

360
00:37:10.520 --> 00:37:12.979
Tracy Kuhrt: you know,

361
00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:15.080
Tracy Kuhrt: people, you know.

362
00:37:16.260 --> 00:37:21.099
Tracy Kuhrt: may may do things differently in the code, right? They They may have changed some stuff.

363
00:37:21.250 --> 00:37:31.429
Tracy Kuhrt: Some of these will definitely feel like they're static. But I think there is the need for us to, you know. Look at this ever so often and make sure that things are up to date.

364
00:37:32.930 --> 00:37:43.170
Jim Zhang: Yeah, that's how i'm thinking about it as well. So given that it's probably a good idea just to tie this up with the quarterly report.

365
00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:50.779
Jim Zhang: either Expand this the section where we do the

366
00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:53.689
Jim Zhang: the the yes and no

367
00:37:55.830 --> 00:37:57.120
Jim Zhang: checklist

368
00:37:57.380 --> 00:38:00.160
Jim Zhang: or link link to this

369
00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:01.959
Jim Zhang: from that section.

370
00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:11.600
Jim Zhang: and we can also, clarify what does require mean? what does not doing? The require. intel.

371
00:38:13.050 --> 00:38:19.669
Jim Zhang: Would that just prevent me from graduating, or there's other other consequences?

372
00:38:21.220 --> 00:38:23.390
Tracy Kuhrt: I yeah, I think.

373
00:38:23.730 --> 00:38:30.850
Tracy Kuhrt: So. 2 things, Jim. One on the project reports. What I thought i'd do is replace the current section that we have

374
00:38:31.110 --> 00:38:34.590
Jim Zhang: to ask the Yes no questions, and just replace it with a

375
00:38:34.610 --> 00:38:38.549
Tracy Kuhrt: pointer to this document. so that people

376
00:38:38.850 --> 00:38:40.999
Tracy Kuhrt: can check their

377
00:38:41.150 --> 00:38:43.179
Tracy Kuhrt: project to make sure that it's up to date

378
00:38:43.410 --> 00:38:44.779
Tracy Kuhrt: right

379
00:38:45.210 --> 00:38:55.600
Tracy Kuhrt: and then related to whether or not, a project has not completed a required step. I think that is the time at which we

380
00:38:55.730 --> 00:39:01.690
Tracy Kuhrt: become a bit noisy with with them as the Toc. And we we say, when are you going to do this?

381
00:39:02.190 --> 00:39:05.060
Tracy Kuhrt: I know I've seen that a lot in the project reports

382
00:39:05.210 --> 00:39:07.920
Tracy Kuhrt: in the past right where

383
00:39:08.440 --> 00:39:10.630
Tracy Kuhrt: where it's been the case that

384
00:39:10.680 --> 00:39:12.279
Tracy Kuhrt: a particular

385
00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:13.839
Tracy Kuhrt: project, Hasn't

386
00:39:13.930 --> 00:39:24.000
Tracy Kuhrt: completed something maybe in the inclusive language statement or something, and and usually a question comes out right in that project report when I'm going to do it, or

387
00:39:24.020 --> 00:39:30.540
Tracy Kuhrt: why haven't you done this? And I think that's there's still the appropriate type of steps for us to be taking.

388
00:39:33.250 --> 00:39:35.109
Jim Zhang: Yeah, Cool Sounds good.

389
00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:45.169
Tracy Kuhrt: all right.

390
00:39:46.740 --> 00:39:51.060
Tracy Kuhrt: Any other volunteers for anybody who would like to

391
00:39:52.870 --> 00:39:54.959
Tracy Kuhrt: volunteer for any of the projects.

392
00:39:56.920 --> 00:39:59.079
Jim Zhang: Yeah, I'll, I'll do the Firefly one.

393
00:39:59.220 --> 00:40:00.589
Tracy Kuhrt: Okay, thanks, too.

394
00:40:00.790 --> 00:40:02.029
That's

395
00:40:20.890 --> 00:40:24.989
Tracy Kuhrt: alright. Any other volunteers anybody want to take on any of the other projects.

396
00:40:28.040 --> 00:40:29.700
I

397
00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:31.339
Peter Somogyvari: and that will

398
00:40:32.420 --> 00:40:34.029
Tracy Kuhrt: and double. Okay.

399
00:40:36.030 --> 00:40:36.890
Tracy Kuhrt: Thanks, Peter.

400
00:40:40.980 --> 00:40:42.140
Tracy Kuhrt: Anyone else.

401
00:40:49.850 --> 00:40:52.709
Tracy Kuhrt: No. Okay. Great.

402
00:40:52.780 --> 00:40:53.799
Tracy Kuhrt: So

403
00:40:53.820 --> 00:41:01.399
Tracy Kuhrt: the the the link is now editable. So if you do open it again, you should be able to see that you can edit it.

404
00:41:01.540 --> 00:41:06.649
Tracy Kuhrt: I have nothing else on the agenda, for today. Does anybody else have anything they would like to bring up

405
00:41:08.340 --> 00:41:12.830
David Enyeart: in terms of logistics. What was the idea to create a tab for each project?

406
00:41:12.970 --> 00:41:15.419
David Enyeart: Yes, or a column? A Tab.

407
00:41:15.730 --> 00:41:16.319
Tracy Kuhrt: Yeah.

408
00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:20.580
David Enyeart: Okay, Which is just basically a copy of the Template.

409
00:41:30.590 --> 00:41:33.989
Tracy Kuhrt: Any other topics for discussion today?

410
00:41:40.240 --> 00:41:41.609
Tracy Kuhrt: No? Okay.

411
00:41:41.670 --> 00:41:44.660
Tracy Kuhrt: Well, then, I appreciate that.

412
00:41:47.670 --> 00:41:53.649
Tracy Kuhrt: I maybe just one comment before I let you guys go. I know you guys were all excited where you hit that button.

413
00:41:53.690 --> 00:42:12.069
Tracy Kuhrt: the the Tsc. I think we said this last time with the Coc. Election is currently in the hands of the governing board. so we're expecting results back from that in a week, probably early next week, I think, is is the timeline for that.

414
00:42:12.230 --> 00:42:13.149
Tracy Kuhrt: So

415
00:42:13.620 --> 00:42:17.490
Tracy Kuhrt: how we will let people know once those results are final

416
00:42:17.550 --> 00:42:21.760
Tracy Kuhrt: as far as the the new Tfc. That's coming in

417
00:42:21.970 --> 00:42:26.780
Tracy Kuhrt: one of the things I was thinking we might do for a toc call next week is.

418
00:42:26.840 --> 00:42:34.049
Tracy Kuhrt: if we do have the results potentially, we'll get some of the new joiners to come in, and we could potentially have a discussion on

419
00:42:34.180 --> 00:42:38.840
Tracy Kuhrt: You know, a transition type discussion where the people who are

420
00:42:38.940 --> 00:42:42.029
Tracy Kuhrt: are leaving the the Toc.

421
00:42:42.120 --> 00:42:45.609
Tracy Kuhrt: Would, you know, provide some thoughts and insight into

422
00:42:45.760 --> 00:42:53.350
Tracy Kuhrt: things that they've done. And I would like to, you know, see, maybe being continued in the next year, and then maybe some

423
00:42:53.370 --> 00:42:56.220
Tracy Kuhrt: input from the new Tlc members as far as

424
00:42:56.330 --> 00:43:00.130
Tracy Kuhrt: what it is that they'd like to accomplish in the next year.

425
00:43:00.150 --> 00:43:01.759
Tracy Kuhrt: So

426
00:43:01.940 --> 00:43:11.350
Tracy Kuhrt: all up for when when the final results actually come in, if it shows up in time or not. But that's that's kind of the current thinking and kind of what's happening

427
00:43:11.380 --> 00:43:13.140
Tracy Kuhrt: with the toc election.

428
00:43:19.420 --> 00:43:24.970
Tracy Kuhrt: All right, so that's all I have. Jim, you did come off me. Did you have a question?

429
00:43:25.300 --> 00:43:36.670
Tracy Kuhrt: No, I was ready to say, thanks to Jason. Alright, great. yeah. So that's it. I will let you guys actually hit the lead. But now so thanks again. For your thoughts and your discussion today.
