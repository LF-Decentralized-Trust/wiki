1
00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.510
Tracy Kuhrt: Welcome to the July 21 hyper ledger technical steering committee call.

2
00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:27.360
Tracy Kuhrt: As you're all aware, two things that we must abide by the first is the address policy notice and is currently being displayed on the screen.

3
00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:39.840
Tracy Kuhrt: And the second is our code of conduct which is like in the agenda as far as announcements go, we have the standard announcements, the weekly developer newsletter goes out each Friday.

4
00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:57.360
Tracy Kuhrt: If you have something that you want to include in that newsletter please leave a comment on the wiki page that's link in the agenda and glad to have ledger developers any other announcements that anybody has or would like to make.

5
00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:24.720
Tracy Kuhrt: Okay, no announcements, so as far as quarterly reports we don't have any do this week I did provide a link for you to check any open task for previous reports in case there were any that you haven't had a chance to review yet.

6
00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:35.730
Tracy Kuhrt: The hyper ledger transact report is due next Thursday, so we may or may not get that before the meeting next week, but we'll.

7
00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:48.090
Tracy Kuhrt: Obviously cover that next week, I did not have any specific tlc business to discuss this week, but please if anybody else has something that we should be discussing now's the time to speak up.

8
00:01:50.790 --> 00:02:00.390
Ry Jones: If I just wanted to quickly mention that I wrote a process that checks, a bunch of our Repo for things and I found that there are.

9
00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.920
Ry Jones: 50 something repos they don't have a maintainer file.

10
00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:12.750
Ry Jones: So I plan on reaching out to those projects and asking them to add them, even if it's just a redirect so.

11
00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.500
Tracy Kuhrt: Okay, great thanks right well.

12
00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:23.490
Hart Montgomery: hey Tracy thanks, so we had a brief legal review over charter language.

13
00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:26.070
Hart Montgomery: yesterday.

14
00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.930
Hart Montgomery: While.

15
00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:37.320
Hart Montgomery: While the essence of what we wanted to capture in the Charter and the overall plan is fine, it looks like some more of our language is going to have to be modified.

16
00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:45.660
Hart Montgomery: So, unfortunately, this is still going to be an ongoing process and we will keep everyone posted on this.

17
00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:57.210
Tracy Kuhrt: Okay, thanks, and we did review that just the overall essence of what it is that we wanted to change with the Governing Board on Monday and there were no.

18
00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:11.160
Tracy Kuhrt: sort of concerns, so I guess next stage heart is to finish up the legal review and any sort of wording and then take that back to the governing board for their vote is that still correct next steps.

19
00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:26.730
Hart Montgomery: that's exactly right, we just need to get everything polished up well apparently our Charter is now on the older side of charters in the Linux foundation, and there has been some desired updates.

20
00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:35.880
Hart Montgomery: Again, not changing anything about how things actually work or the essence of the Charter, but just the terms themselves so.

21
00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:38.940
Tracy Kuhrt: Great.

22
00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:44.160
Tracy Kuhrt: we'll look forward to seeing that when it's ready any other.

23
00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:48.720
Tracy Kuhrt: TC discussion items before we move on to the task force discussion.

24
00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:03.840
Tracy Kuhrt: Okay i'm not seeing anybody come off mute or any hands so Jim I think it is over to you to talk about the project health Task Force.

25
00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:09.390
Jim Zhang: yeah thanks Tracy me share the screen.

26
00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:11.310
Jim Zhang: Okay.

27
00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:15.150
Jim Zhang: So I I did some.

28
00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:43.020
Jim Zhang: For work from the discussions we had in the last call that we talked about this and I I feel like we're at a pretty good place in terms of recognizing the different types of data that needs to be collected to accurately reflect the health of a project and where they will come from.

29
00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:50.790
Jim Zhang: I think I feel like the next step is figuring out what we do.

30
00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:55.920
Jim Zhang: And what are the things we should look at first.

31
00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:02.310
Jim Zhang: To get things to get things going to get data actually collected.

32
00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:09.300
Jim Zhang: To that end I categorized the stuff that.

33
00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:13.620
Jim Zhang: We listed in this column the supporting data column.

34
00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:17.250
Jim Zhang: into it, two different ways.

35
00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:24.660
Jim Zhang: One is under this bullet list in three categories, what are the things that are.

36
00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:34.860
Jim Zhang: Quote unquote easily collected with API calls because they came from a developer friendly platform like github or discord.

37
00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:59.970
Jim Zhang: What are the things that don't really exist and behind any API so we have to manually collect them and the third category is they, they don't necessarily exist anywhere, even in digital form they pretty much existing people's minds, so we have to think about ways to to pull those out.

38
00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:14.220
Jim Zhang: Using you know surveys, for example, is just one one measure that I can think of, so we have to ask people for for this kind of information so.

39
00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:23.340
Jim Zhang: As you can see it's pretty straightforward the github and discord information can be can be pulled from API calls.

40
00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:33.060
Jim Zhang: will talk about separately, who, who we contact, or you know who do we work with to.

41
00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:35.970
Jim Zhang: make those API calls happened.

42
00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:41.730
Jim Zhang: In the second category, we need.

43
00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:56.970
Jim Zhang: people to go to these different places, they may be in documentation section of a project, they may be in wiki pages or meetup.

44
00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:01.770
Jim Zhang: in various places and just collect them manually.

45
00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:11.100
Jim Zhang: But there is also a third category where we should maybe work with the marketing team.

46
00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:20.520
Jim Zhang: To think about can we create can we create surveys or polls to ask people about about face.

47
00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:32.700
Jim Zhang: I won't go through each of these bullets individually, but are there any questions or comments or feedback on on this part.

48
00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:42.810
Jim Zhang: I guess, especially.

49
00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:48.000
Jim Zhang: In the third category, besides surveys.

50
00:07:50.220 --> 00:08:07.050
Jim Zhang: Do we think there are other means to collect this type of information, for example, how do we know if a Community a project is actively effectively involving the Community to define a roadmap.

51
00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:16.950
Jim Zhang: may just have to ask the participants of that community that are that are not competitors.

52
00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:26.940
Jim Zhang: To ask them how do they feel right, how do they feel do they do, they feel they are being included.

53
00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:29.460
Jim Zhang: In defining the roadmap.

54
00:08:31.410 --> 00:08:39.390
Jim Zhang: I don't think there's any objective data that exists anywhere what tell the story.

55
00:08:41.490 --> 00:08:47.970
Jim Zhang: The second bullet about can new ideas be accommodated similar to the first one.

56
00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:54.210
Jim Zhang: Basically, are outside voices being respected and.

57
00:08:56.910 --> 00:09:02.580
Jim Zhang: that's it's pretty subjective that we may have just actively ask people about.

58
00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:09.330
Jim Zhang: So all of these are in this kind of category.

59
00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:17.100
Jim Zhang: Creating polls and surveys, is the only.

60
00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:21.000
Jim Zhang: way.

61
00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:26.250
Jim Zhang: To create this or do we have other other ways to do this.

62
00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:30.270
Jim Zhang: Maybe I don't know I don't know if.

63
00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:34.410
Jim Zhang: folks have ideas to contribute here.

64
00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:42.480
Tracy Kuhrt: So, Jim I I think you used an interesting word when you use the word subjective.

65
00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:45.870
Tracy Kuhrt: You know I, I think that.

66
00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:55.020
Tracy Kuhrt: The challenge when it comes to measuring project health based on subjective type of.

67
00:09:56.250 --> 00:10:01.440
Tracy Kuhrt: Criteria versus objective type of criteria is going to be very challenging.

68
00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:18.060
Tracy Kuhrt: Right from the perspective of you may think people respond to you very quickly, I may think that people don't respond to me very quickly for project right and what What is the difference between you and me, in that case or.

69
00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:28.860
Tracy Kuhrt: Maybe it's the question that's the problem right it's not the individual I just I think there's a whole lot of challenges that come into play there.

70
00:10:29.310 --> 00:10:43.110
Tracy Kuhrt: So I think we need to be careful about criteria that might be considered subjective for measuring project health, although, in some cases, the.

71
00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:55.380
Tracy Kuhrt: feeling that somebody gets when they tried to enter any community is so much more important than anything else right do they feel like they're welcome.

72
00:10:56.130 --> 00:11:05.100
Tracy Kuhrt: When they join a Community call or they immediately welcome, even if there's somebody who's never been on that call before they got welcome.

73
00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:17.130
Tracy Kuhrt: that's going to have a big impact as far as whether or not somebody decides to stay in that Community right or whether or not they decided to go and so.

74
00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:34.980
Tracy Kuhrt: it's I think this is the the important part to being a welcoming community is how how how much people feel like they belong to that Community and.

75
00:11:35.970 --> 00:11:53.130
Tracy Kuhrt: are welcomed in that Community so I don't know that that's a that leads us anywhere, but I think it's something that we need to really consider with this particular task force of measuring project health versus measuring the.

76
00:11:55.350 --> 00:11:58.200
Tracy Kuhrt: The desire for people to stay once they've joined.

77
00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:05.880
Jim Zhang: yeah very much agree with with the comment Tracy that.

78
00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:08.460
Jim Zhang: This category.

79
00:12:09.690 --> 00:12:16.320
Jim Zhang: touches on the more softy side of things, which is still very important.

80
00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:38.250
Jim Zhang: It can be expressed in multiple different ways it's very hard to measure with data how welcoming you know the tone of voice the presenters are during the Community calls when people raise a question how are they treated today to welcome respected.

81
00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:50.070
Jim Zhang: So I I I chose the word subjective because that's definitely from each individual's point of view is subjective.

82
00:12:51.270 --> 00:13:05.190
Jim Zhang: subjective feeling, more than anything else, and I do agree that it's a pretty important part in people's decision should I continue to engage with this project or not.

83
00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:19.440
Jim Zhang: because every time I said something it's either neglected or shut down, you know why would I waste my time because i'm not making any any impact.

84
00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:26.190
Jim Zhang: versus my first question, you know, led to a.

85
00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:43.620
Jim Zhang: Great discussion that that ended up being a feature that lands in the next release that's you know that's a great way to engage people and it's hard to collect data along that along that process to say.

86
00:13:45.630 --> 00:13:52.110
Jim Zhang: This is what the the project team is doing right, you have to you have to ask.

87
00:13:53.430 --> 00:14:08.400
Jim Zhang: So I think the the third category is probably the most challenging part, but it could also be very straightforward, because we know how to create pose we know how to design the right questions, we just need to decide if if that's.

88
00:14:09.690 --> 00:14:11.190
Jim Zhang: Something we want to do.

89
00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:16.080
Tracy Kuhrt: He has his hand up.

90
00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:20.610
Jim Zhang: Go ahead right Thank you.

91
00:14:21.090 --> 00:14:30.300
Arun S M: Gentlemen Tracy so I believe the topic that we're discussing kind of ties back to being responsive and in the Community, so that people feel welcome about it.

92
00:14:31.710 --> 00:14:41.160
Arun S M: So very, very similar topic that ties back probably ties to both of these roles right, for instance, how friendly a particular project days and then.

93
00:14:41.550 --> 00:14:52.950
Arun S M: What other alternatives to we have, and apart from surveys, so this also came up in our security process Task Force and then Tracy I saw your replies as well i'll try to address them.

94
00:14:54.480 --> 00:15:02.460
Arun S M: Was that some of these issues that are reported through these tools that are again linked to hyper ledger foundation right for.

95
00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:12.180
Arun S M: Where, for instance, the security issues are reported, we need a mechanism to address them in time if that's not done then.

96
00:15:13.770 --> 00:15:25.890
Arun S M: When I say address it should at least be a reply, saying that hate your effort is considered and we are in process of evaluating right so when such an response would matter towards.

97
00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:40.770
Arun S M: So these external tools that we currently have I guess that's the security reporting tool that we can consider, for now, but there could be other tools which i'm not aware of could also play a role.

98
00:15:45.510 --> 00:15:45.900
Jim Zhang: yeah I.

99
00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:51.510
Jim Zhang: agree with that So besides the discussions that happen on.

100
00:15:53.190 --> 00:16:02.190
Jim Zhang: hyper ledger properties, you know the Community cars and whatnot those actionable tools should also be considered yeah thanks for that input around.

101
00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:19.950
Jim Zhang: cool um if there's no other feedback for now, maybe we can continue the second thing I did was for each of the items I listed them.

102
00:16:22.410 --> 00:16:30.360
Jim Zhang: with different color trying to decide what are the things we can start doing in the first face to collect them.

103
00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:39.570
Jim Zhang: So green means easy blue means low harder and red means very hard.

104
00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:44.250
Jim Zhang: So if we can agree on.

105
00:16:46.170 --> 00:16:53.520
Jim Zhang: The list of green items, then we can think about doing them so.

106
00:16:55.590 --> 00:17:12.660
Jim Zhang: I guess I don't know what's the best way to run through that maybe just give folks a few minutes to look at this list and see if the coloring makes sense, and we should and then i'd like to.

107
00:17:14.340 --> 00:17:15.810
Jim Zhang: start talking about.

108
00:17:17.670 --> 00:17:22.290
Jim Zhang: How do we, how do we go about collecting them who do we talk to.

109
00:17:33.870 --> 00:17:40.170
Jim Zhang: So folks please maybe take one minute or two just.

110
00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:48.930
Jim Zhang: Take a look and see if any jumps out at you that's miss colored and we can talk about those and then we'll move on to.

111
00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:51.330
Jim Zhang: To the how part.

112
00:17:56.310 --> 00:18:02.910
Tracy Kuhrt: So, Jim under diversity, the first bullet, the number of organizations, contributing to the code base and roadmap.

113
00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:06.360
Tracy Kuhrt: Right you send out a link.

114
00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:11.220
Tracy Kuhrt: Recently, to a tool that collect some data.

115
00:18:13.590 --> 00:18:20.100
Tracy Kuhrt: I forget what the tool is called but I had a look at that and they did have organizational data.

116
00:18:21.210 --> 00:18:24.330
Tracy Kuhrt: associated with that and i'm wondering if.

117
00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:33.450
Tracy Kuhrt: They can get that information if we could also get that information in some way, shape or form and maybe that's a green instead of a blue.

118
00:18:36.330 --> 00:18:38.370
Ry Jones: Are you talking about the ght thing.

119
00:18:38.850 --> 00:18:43.020
Tracy Kuhrt: No, no, no, the external tool see if I can find it.

120
00:18:44.610 --> 00:18:45.510
Tracy Kuhrt: On discord.

121
00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:47.100
Ry Jones: The.

122
00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:50.790
Ry Jones: Open something that I oh.

123
00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:53.040
Tracy Kuhrt: yeah okay.

124
00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:54.360
yeah.

125
00:18:56.220 --> 00:19:00.870
Ry Jones: i'll i'll go link and drop it in the tlc chat.

126
00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:11.340
Jim Zhang: Is that a tools tells us the organization behind each of the github handles.

127
00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:14.370
Tracy Kuhrt: it's oasis insight that I oh.

128
00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:20.730
Tracy Kuhrt: it's what it is, I found it right when he said open, I was able to search.

129
00:19:22.590 --> 00:19:32.010
Tracy Kuhrt: And you can specify a repository and it gives you a lot of data on on a particular repository.

130
00:19:42.030 --> 00:19:42.390
Tracy Kuhrt: link.

131
00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:44.250
Ry Jones: yeah I also.

132
00:19:45.150 --> 00:19:46.140
Ry Jones: did a thing about.

133
00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:48.960
Ry Jones: I added a.

134
00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:53.790
Ry Jones: thing for hyper ledger as well.

135
00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:02.760
Tracy Kuhrt: Okay, I put a link in the.

136
00:20:04.470 --> 00:20:18.960
Tracy Kuhrt: In the discord channel for today's meeting so people would like to take a look at it, I think there's some really interesting information in that you'd found there right and so to be to be something that is as we go forward.

137
00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:24.240
Jim Zhang: cool that's that's great.

138
00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:31.920
Jim Zhang: thanks for that input Tracy.

139
00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:35.460
Jim Zhang: scare folks.

140
00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:37.530
Jim Zhang: To run down the list.

141
00:21:04.950 --> 00:21:05.190
Jim Zhang: Oh.

142
00:21:21.690 --> 00:21:34.290
Ry Jones: I also I created i've posted a link to the hyper ledger collection and I also create a collections for a zoo and fabric and I will post a link to the fabric one as well.

143
00:22:09.030 --> 00:22:11.100
Jim Zhang: Okay, so.

144
00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:18.000
Jim Zhang: let's talk about how to go about collecting them, the first obvious.

145
00:22:19.710 --> 00:22:23.160
Jim Zhang: place is get up api's.

146
00:22:26.070 --> 00:22:30.720
Jim Zhang: A lot of us are developers, we know those api's and we know you can make a lot of.

147
00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:37.740
Jim Zhang: composite API calls and process data right some simple programs.

148
00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:41.700
Jim Zhang: The same for this Court.

149
00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:49.560
Jim Zhang: api's I guess the main question is who would be doing this kind of thing.

150
00:22:55.740 --> 00:23:01.710
Jim Zhang: I know I can do it, but I know a lot of people on the call can do it, but we don't really.

151
00:23:03.210 --> 00:23:13.080
Jim Zhang: have the time or the resources necessary to make this a mission for ourselves, personally I don't know if.

152
00:23:14.250 --> 00:23:18.720
Jim Zhang: hyper ledger has the resource for doing this kind of thing i'm i'm completely.

153
00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:21.750
Jim Zhang: Asking for your opinions.

154
00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:26.460
Ry Jones: If it's something that we can automate then.

155
00:23:28.530 --> 00:23:31.770
Ry Jones: preferably by github action than the answer is yes.

156
00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:36.510
Ry Jones: If it's something that we can add to.

157
00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:40.170
Ry Jones: The effects, the answer is maybe.

158
00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:43.260
Jim Zhang: what's the second one.

159
00:23:45.690 --> 00:23:48.270
Ry Jones: insights fx insights.

160
00:23:48.570 --> 00:23:54.150
Ry Jones: gotcha it's undergoing a lot of change right now I can't even add like new projects.

161
00:23:56.610 --> 00:24:00.480
Ry Jones: To it once they get the new version public then.

162
00:24:01.620 --> 00:24:02.760
Ry Jones: i'll see what we can get.

163
00:24:05.910 --> 00:24:06.030
Oh.

164
00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:09.720
Jim Zhang: yeah please.

165
00:24:10.530 --> 00:24:15.570
Hart Montgomery: yeah, I just wanted to second right here that in the long run, I think a lot of this stuff is a great.

166
00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:21.630
Hart Montgomery: You know it's great suggestion for what else fx should include.

167
00:24:23.730 --> 00:24:30.150
Hart Montgomery: So you know if some people from the Community, want to go talk to the fx folks.

168
00:24:31.230 --> 00:24:49.110
Hart Montgomery: At some point, I think that'd be a fantastic thing I think they would be interested in hearing from you all, and you know it might be a way to push things that you know we want into you know places that would actually benefit everyone at the Linux foundation.

169
00:24:50.190 --> 00:25:02.010
Hart Montgomery: As Ray correctly pointed out these folks are extremely busy, and behind right now, so this is again a longer run thing than a shorter run, but you know it's something we should definitely consider.

170
00:25:06.660 --> 00:25:07.440
Jim Zhang: sounds good.

171
00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:15.330
Jim Zhang: So if we want to talk to the l ex teammates I guess it will be.

172
00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:22.110
Jim Zhang: Just me and Ryan getting a call with them is that as simple as it is that.

173
00:25:24.630 --> 00:25:25.650
Ry Jones: yeah.

174
00:25:28.620 --> 00:25:29.670
Ry Jones: We can set that up.

175
00:25:30.630 --> 00:25:31.110
Okay.

176
00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:34.200
Jim Zhang: sounds good.

177
00:25:36.990 --> 00:25:42.420
Jim Zhang: So I heard can help actions, this would be.

178
00:25:43.530 --> 00:25:51.060
Jim Zhang: Asking each project team to set this up in the repositories or This is something that.

179
00:25:52.110 --> 00:25:57.180
Jim Zhang: The hyper ledger team can set up in at the org level.

180
00:25:58.020 --> 00:26:05.490
Ry Jones: I would prefer to set it up in probably the no not for every project that's just terrible.

181
00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:10.530
Ry Jones: I mean it, it would be code for no reason.

182
00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:16.950
Ry Jones: i'll find a repo or make a repo where it can park.

183
00:26:18.930 --> 00:26:19.470
Jim Zhang: cool.

184
00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:27.540
Jim Zhang: Right.

185
00:26:28.830 --> 00:26:32.910
Jim Zhang: And did I hear right you volunteer to.

186
00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:35.160
Jim Zhang: To look into this.

187
00:26:36.990 --> 00:26:40.530
Jim Zhang: I think we can definitely help you know, whereas in terms of.

188
00:26:41.790 --> 00:26:48.510
Jim Zhang: Finding the API finding the right endpoints and that sort of thing, but would you be responsible for.

189
00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:52.560
Jim Zhang: looking after this this repo and the content in.

190
00:26:54.630 --> 00:26:55.050
Jim Zhang: China.

191
00:26:55.350 --> 00:26:56.430
Ry Jones: I can.

192
00:26:58.380 --> 00:27:04.170
Ry Jones: buy My preference would be that I don't develop it but.

193
00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:09.630
Ry Jones: Let me take a stab at i'm already collecting a bunch of this data in other ways.

194
00:27:10.350 --> 00:27:12.360
Jim Zhang: yeah I saw those.

195
00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:16.830
Ry Jones: So let's just.

196
00:27:17.850 --> 00:27:18.570
Ry Jones: Give me.

197
00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:22.170
Ry Jones: But let's just say no firm answer at this point.

198
00:27:23.370 --> 00:27:23.790
Ry Jones: I mean.

199
00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:32.250
Jim Zhang: yeah we probably can ask for help from the Community as well there's a lot of.

200
00:27:36.570 --> 00:27:42.210
Jim Zhang: There should be there should be people who are willing to help in this way.

201
00:27:46.530 --> 00:28:01.620
Jim Zhang: Okay cool we should get the repository setup and then at least make one or two endpoint cause to to show how things should be implemented, and then we can we can grow from there.

202
00:28:02.370 --> 00:28:12.480
Jim Zhang: I think between you and me, we can at least get something going to show as an example, how things should be done, and then over time back and be built up.

203
00:28:15.420 --> 00:28:17.070
Jim Zhang: Does that sound okay to you right.

204
00:28:20.430 --> 00:28:22.770
Ry Jones: yep are sounds good.

205
00:28:24.510 --> 00:28:29.190
Jim Zhang: So that covers the github api's and discord api's.

206
00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:38.670
Jim Zhang: And that is majority of the green items.

207
00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:41.790
Jim Zhang: Let me think.

208
00:28:44.730 --> 00:28:51.690
Jim Zhang: There are also These are the things that are marked as green but not API driven.

209
00:28:53.700 --> 00:28:55.470
Jim Zhang: meetups, for example.

210
00:28:57.150 --> 00:29:01.890
Jim Zhang: don't know if the meetup platform has any APIs that we can use to say how many.

211
00:29:04.890 --> 00:29:18.450
Jim Zhang: meetups were organized by the hyper ledger once do we, how do we even identify the high pleasure ones I don't think there's a single organization that owns all of the meetup groups.

212
00:29:19.020 --> 00:29:21.300
Ry Jones: There is, we have a paid meetup account.

213
00:29:22.230 --> 00:29:23.130
David Boswell: yeah their ends.

214
00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:30.300
David Boswell: And with their beautiful is pretty nice api's as far as I know, i've looked at it, but we haven't really used them but i've looked into it and they do have pretty extensive.

215
00:29:31.830 --> 00:29:32.280
Jim Zhang: Okay.

216
00:29:32.310 --> 00:29:34.860
Jim Zhang: that's great news I haven't looked at them at all.

217
00:29:34.890 --> 00:29:46.260
Jim Zhang: So that's great news, so all the hyper ledger meetup groups in different locations, they all belong to the the High Level hyper ledger more.

218
00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:54.780
David Boswell: yeah I mean there may be one or two that are outside the org that just people set up but that's pretty minor yeah all the ones that we run are on one word.

219
00:29:56.550 --> 00:29:56.820
Jim Zhang: Okay.

220
00:29:57.150 --> 00:29:58.140
that's great news.

221
00:30:18.060 --> 00:30:20.460
Jim Zhang: So we can look into those as well.

222
00:30:22.950 --> 00:30:27.210
Jim Zhang: let's see are there other sources in the green.

223
00:30:29.550 --> 00:30:35.790
Jim Zhang: So docker docker post as pretty straightforward and docker COM.

224
00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:39.240
Jim Zhang: binary downloads.

225
00:30:40.890 --> 00:30:47.340
Jim Zhang: don't know if github provides this, but it would be a github API if it's if there is one.

226
00:30:51.090 --> 00:30:53.040
Jim Zhang: same for all of this.

227
00:30:56.520 --> 00:31:05.880
Jim Zhang: github github Okay, so I think that covers all the green items, so if we move on to the blue ones.

228
00:31:07.110 --> 00:31:07.200
Jim Zhang: I.

229
00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:13.680
Jim Zhang: think the blue ones are mainly manual manual collection.

230
00:31:15.300 --> 00:31:18.510
Jim Zhang: I guess My first question is how do we feel about.

231
00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:26.400
Jim Zhang: Asking each project team to self report, or do we want to have a.

232
00:31:28.890 --> 00:31:35.100
Jim Zhang: team that the PSC designates that would be doing this for every project.

233
00:31:42.660 --> 00:32:02.310
Jim Zhang: Because it's manual collection somebody has to do some busy work to collect that data, we want a decentralized that for all the projects to do that from themselves as you mean everybody will do it diligently and honestly, or do we want a.

234
00:32:04.140 --> 00:32:07.410
Jim Zhang: Specific team to be responsible for all projects.

235
00:32:08.670 --> 00:32:11.370
Tracy Kuhrt: So, so one thing that i'll say is.

236
00:32:12.450 --> 00:32:28.170
Tracy Kuhrt: Part of the reason for creating this task force, if I remember correctly, was the fact that we thought we could automate a lot of the project reports if we start asking a bunch of questions of the project.

237
00:32:29.580 --> 00:32:33.630
Tracy Kuhrt: maintain owners to answer in during the project reports are we.

238
00:32:34.980 --> 00:32:39.390
Tracy Kuhrt: Doing are we taking a step back right from where we're at today with the project reports.

239
00:32:39.990 --> 00:32:59.940
Tracy Kuhrt: yeah so I you know this let's keep in mind that the original intention of this is to three things easier for us one to determine what is helping the project is but to to make it easier for the people who are creating the reports to not have to provide data that is.

240
00:33:02.250 --> 00:33:07.050
Tracy Kuhrt: You know, over and beyond, something right Ted to make their project reporting eight here.

241
00:33:12.030 --> 00:33:12.750
Jim Zhang: Yes.

242
00:33:14.250 --> 00:33:21.300
Jim Zhang: thanks for that reminder Tracy is so um I think it was just just naturally.

243
00:33:23.070 --> 00:33:28.620
Jim Zhang: coming out of the discussion that these data sources were.

244
00:33:30.150 --> 00:33:37.050
Jim Zhang: listed here that are at least at at the moment not automated level.

245
00:33:39.930 --> 00:33:52.050
Jim Zhang: So I guess this changes the question to do we want to just put these aside for now until they become automated of all, we can totally.

246
00:33:53.130 --> 00:33:54.870
Jim Zhang: make that decision instead.

247
00:33:58.680 --> 00:34:04.380
Jim Zhang: So I based on what Tracy just reminded us, I like to propose that.

248
00:34:05.460 --> 00:34:12.390
Jim Zhang: We do not look at collecting those that are not automated.

249
00:34:17.460 --> 00:34:19.740
Jim Zhang: there any objections to that.

250
00:34:22.740 --> 00:34:23.070
Tracy Kuhrt: Your.

251
00:34:24.900 --> 00:34:26.250
Jim Zhang: Objective C.

252
00:34:26.700 --> 00:34:34.680
Peter Somogyvari: say that I support that because I think the low hanging fruit will be all the automated ones and and can always iterate on the manual ones later.

253
00:34:39.540 --> 00:34:41.010
Jim Zhang: Great thanks Peter.

254
00:34:59.610 --> 00:35:02.220
Jim Zhang: Alright, so that solves a big problem.

255
00:35:03.810 --> 00:35:05.400
Jim Zhang: For us so.

256
00:35:06.870 --> 00:35:09.780
Jim Zhang: We would focus on I think these.

257
00:35:11.460 --> 00:35:16.080
Jim Zhang: Three major data sources that are API driven.

258
00:35:17.190 --> 00:35:38.610
Jim Zhang: I think 80% or more are between github and discord there's some behind meetup and Ryan, I was look start looking to maybe at least one call or two calls to each of the platforms and create a new.

259
00:35:40.140 --> 00:35:43.860
Jim Zhang: repository to show how those should be made.

260
00:35:45.210 --> 00:35:57.090
Jim Zhang: Is a bash script or no jess or Python programs right, so people can contribute to that over time and we're all this this footprint.

261
00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:01.080
Jim Zhang: Honestly, the.

262
00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:16.920
Jim Zhang: The red colored ones are also falling into the same category of not being automated double for now, so I think we should just also leave those behind, but should we consider.

263
00:36:18.270 --> 00:36:24.150
Jim Zhang: Still, creating a space for those to be recorded if people would like to contribute to to that.

264
00:36:26.580 --> 00:36:28.650
Jim Zhang: For example, I would imagine.

265
00:36:29.790 --> 00:36:30.870
Jim Zhang: Research.

266
00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:34.500
Jim Zhang: folks would like.

267
00:36:35.550 --> 00:36:43.500
Jim Zhang: To say our effort has resulted, a publication of these you know 10 different.

268
00:36:44.670 --> 00:36:45.630
Jim Zhang: papers.

269
00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:54.540
Jim Zhang: right on the cornell side, for example, where would they so that they would have a place to to report that.

270
00:36:57.210 --> 00:37:08.850
Jim Zhang: What would be the right place for that kind of reporting to be done, I think it should be a long running thing so maybe create a page.

271
00:37:09.870 --> 00:37:12.240
Jim Zhang: On the tlc side dedicated to that.

272
00:37:19.230 --> 00:37:20.190
Jim Zhang: That makes sense.

273
00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:40.710
Peter Somogyvari: I think we could allow people to self report these custom metrics that they have, but the real question is.

274
00:37:41.730 --> 00:37:46.230
Peter Somogyvari: Then, how do we take that into account if you know if it's there.

275
00:37:47.790 --> 00:37:48.450
Peter Somogyvari: Then.

276
00:37:50.070 --> 00:37:55.080
Peter Somogyvari: must be then spend time sort of processing it manually as well.

277
00:37:56.130 --> 00:38:05.640
Peter Somogyvari: Because I wouldn't mind people just collecting the data so that maybe in the future can be used I wouldn't necessarily want to be then.

278
00:38:09.270 --> 00:38:22.260
Peter Somogyvari: obligated to then do myself myself to something with myself that would then end up being yet another manual process, so I don't want I wouldn't want that to leak into.

279
00:38:23.580 --> 00:38:29.850
Peter Somogyvari: or grow itself out into more valuable things basically i'm just a huge proponent of automation.

280
00:38:33.750 --> 00:38:51.240
Jim Zhang: So I think what you're saying is definitely allow people to report but don't necessarily have to take those into account when evaluating your projects, health, because that will require making those reports.

281
00:38:52.680 --> 00:38:57.330
Jim Zhang: accurate and comprehensive, which will generate more manual work.

282
00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:01.350
Peter Somogyvari: Yes, sorry to the or.

283
00:39:01.770 --> 00:39:12.840
Peter Somogyvari: If they want to call the information out for whatever else reason it's always there and acknowledge its existence, I just don't want to be additional that your chakras.

284
00:39:16.680 --> 00:39:17.190
Tracy Kuhrt: Bobby.

285
00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:36.150
Bobbi Muscara: hi everybody um I keep some of these metrics on a frameworks and tool page for each project i'll put a link in the chat to the basic one if that helps I continue to do this, so it would be there for.

286
00:39:37.290 --> 00:39:43.590
Bobbi Muscara: people to look at and get metrics from i'll put a link in the chat hold on just a second.

287
00:39:47.850 --> 00:39:49.470
Bobbi Muscara: Oh, do I have to use discord chat.

288
00:39:50.700 --> 00:39:52.350
Jim Zhang: um yeah I guess if you.

289
00:39:52.440 --> 00:39:54.870
Bobbi Muscara: Okay, no worries i'll put it in the discord chat.

290
00:39:54.930 --> 00:39:59.850
Jim Zhang: yeah if you're if you are their workplace great thanks for being.

291
00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:04.290
Jim Zhang: Okay um let's see.

292
00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:06.900
Jim Zhang: So I think.

293
00:40:08.250 --> 00:40:12.000
Jim Zhang: For me at least it's a pretty good place to end the call.

294
00:40:13.290 --> 00:40:24.180
Jim Zhang: I feel like we have some concrete actions to act on and we agreed on the the types of data we'd like to collect with the automation.

295
00:40:26.670 --> 00:40:33.930
Jim Zhang: And right and I will take the action and report to folks on the next call.

296
00:40:35.100 --> 00:40:39.420
Jim Zhang: Are there any other last minute comments or questions.

297
00:40:46.290 --> 00:40:49.980
Jim Zhang: If not, I gave the call back to you Tracy.

298
00:40:53.220 --> 00:40:54.810
Tracy Kuhrt: So, as far as I know.

299
00:40:57.750 --> 00:41:09.660
Tracy Kuhrt: I haven't seen any sort of items cannot yet for next week's call on, but they do that's fine, we can get them in the agenda, but what I was thinking is that maybe we needed to.

300
00:41:10.050 --> 00:41:20.970
Tracy Kuhrt: Use the test for discussion next week for continuing from the security discussion since I know there's been some movement on that, since the last go around.

301
00:41:21.480 --> 00:41:34.530
Tracy Kuhrt: And then we'll go back and start over again with Dino on the project gaps and just continue that way with the task force so that's my plan if anybody has any other ideas, open to hearing them.

302
00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:37.080
Tracy Kuhrt: Bobby.

303
00:41:38.220 --> 00:41:54.150
Bobbi Muscara: I was just wondering if the documentation task force can get on the calendar, the first meeting I think it's the second of August i'm just double check that for the it's the fourth of August to report what we've concluded.

304
00:41:54.750 --> 00:41:56.130
Tracy Kuhrt: Yes, sounds good sounds good.

305
00:41:57.450 --> 00:41:59.580
Tracy Kuhrt: So so we'll do security next week.

306
00:41:59.880 --> 00:42:01.470
Tracy Kuhrt: The gods mutation one the following.

307
00:42:01.470 --> 00:42:05.850
Tracy Kuhrt: Week start over again if that sounds good to everybody.

308
00:42:08.940 --> 00:42:14.400
Tracy Kuhrt: Alright, so with that we'll close the meeting, and we will talk again next week.

309
00:42:16.590 --> 00:42:17.640
Jim Zhang: Thanks Tracy thanks guys.
