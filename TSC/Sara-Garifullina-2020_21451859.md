### Nominated By

Self

### Short personal bio

Hello! My name is Sara and I have been working for Soramitsu and helping to maintain HL Iroha for more than 2 years now as a community manager and a little bit of a tech writer/ editor. I am not technically a tech person – musician, major in English literature and psychologist by BA and MA diplomas and technology enthusiast by choice – nice to meet you! ![(smile)](images/icons/emoticons/smile.png) 

I have experience volunteering in science and tech communications as well as in tech support – which makes bringing tech-related ideas to anyone my thing and something I love to do (I even got admitted to TUM this year to keep studying technology from social point o view).

It seems like this is where other nominees tell more about their community experience in HL. Well, I visited only one offline Hyperledger event (+ a few online) – Bootcamp in Moscow and I realised how great it is – feeling yourself part of the community, talking about project you love and making people feel welcome discussing it – it is encouraging on so many levels. Not only I visited that bootcamp myself but I was also a Grey Cardinal behind some other presentations about Iroha (just kidding – what I did was mostly help HL Iroha maintainers to prepare for presentations) and I loved it too – now I want to dive deeper into the community by becoming a member of the TSC.

### Short personal pitch

First, here are some things I believe to be necessary for good communications in any group:

- Any decision should not only benefit one person or a smaller group. I think that every decision should be based on what it might bring to the community as a whole: the users, maintainers, contributors and everyone else – so the community could thrive in all its diversity
- All voices should be heard. We cannot make people share their opinions but if there is an idea or opinion – it should be heard and considered.
- Community should not only listen and react but actively move towards its members – by creating not confusing policies but easy to understand documentation using human language explaining all the whys and hows.

These three statements, I hope, could clarify why I am nominating myself – because I believe that, although not a tech person, I could bring value to the Hyperledger community by applying my communication/ writing skills and my experience both as a person managing communications in the community and as a contributor/ member myself communicating with different groups including TSC while adding something to the project. I want to make it easy for anyone new (or not new!) who wants to express themselves through open-source project, who has something to give but might believe it to be too difficult or unavailable.

I would like to be the person who could probably be like a communication bridge between different groups in Hyperledger and TSC – including the underrepresented ones and try to bring more voices into decisions.
