# Technical Oversight Committee : Sent by CIVS System to Voters

Created by David Huseby, last modified on Oct 09, 2020

Dear Hyperledger Community Members,

Thank you for contributing to Hyperledger! The election for the 2020-2021 term has started. Please read the [nomination statements](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/TSC/2020+Nomination+Statements) from each candidate.

The TSC is responsible for setting the direction and character of the Hyperledger community across all its technical projects. This is your chance to influence that direction and character. The TSC should represent a broad range of voices from across the Hyperledger community. We encourage you to take the time to read the candidate statements linked from this email and consider your vote carefully.

Thank you!
