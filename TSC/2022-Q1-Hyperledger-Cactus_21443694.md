# Technical Oversight Committee : 2022 Q1 Hyperledger Cactus

Created by Hart Montgomery, last modified by Jim Zhang on Mar 09, 2022

Project Health

Cactus continues to be a healthy project.   Cactus grew even during the holiday period, which was excellent news for the project.  Moreover, our communications and response times have been more prompt, which is encouraging for adding even more contributors in the future.  We continue to get non-Accenture and Fujitsu contributions, which is a very positive sign going forward.   Additionally, we are progressing in our work with the teams from Yui and Weaver as well on wider Hyperledger interoperability. There is also a rising awareness by the academic community in Hyperledger Cactus.

# Required Information

1. [Have you switched from master to main in all your repos](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/TSC/Projects+have+two+quarters+to+comply+with+common+repo+structure?focusedCommentId=21452776)? Yes.
2. [Have you implemented the Common Repository Structure in all your repos](https://tsc.hyperledger.org/repository-structure.html)? Yes.

# Questions/Issues for the TSC

This isn't really a question, but we are planning a v1.0 release in the not-too-distant future.  We have more questions for marketing–who should we talk to about this?

Some projects under the Hyperledger Summer Internship program (namely the research-oriented projects) led to multiple academic publications. This has proven to be a good way to attract academic and industry interest towards Cactus and Hyperledger in general. Are there plans to foment cross-project academic collaboration in Hyperledger? 

# Releases

We had two releases since the last quarterly report (which wasn't quite a full quarter).  For full details, please see [https://github.com/hyperledger/cactus/releases](https://github.com/hyperledger/cactus/releases).  We have a nice outline there.

v1.0.0-rc.2:

This release focused on some bug fixes and worked out some things in our Fabric Connector, WASM, and HTLC coordinator.

v1.0.0-rc.3:

This release focused mostly on bug fixes.  However, there is notably some work done towards Weaver compatibility.

# Overall Activity in the Past Quarter

There has been quite a bit of activity in the past quarter on Cactus despite the fact that it was the "holiday quarter," which is usually mostly dead for HL projects. We have had more and more contributors, and have continued to increase the features and blockchain support of Cactus.

Some things the maintainers wanted to emphasize:

- &lt;Maintainers add here&gt;

We have also been continuing collaborations with the other interop efforts in Hyperledger, and this is something we want to continue to emphasize.

We have been supporting academic paper writing in the scope of the Hyperledger Summer Internship program. A technical report has been published, and there is a paper being written.

# Current Plans

We are currently working towards a v1.0 release, and this is probably the biggest goal (in terms of work) that we have in the near future. In addition, we also want to work more closely with other interop efforts in Hyperledger and are putting in the effort to do so.

In addition, for more precise plans, we encourage you to check out our ZenHub board or our extensive Github issues list ([https://github.com/hyperledger/cactus/issues](https://github.com/hyperledger/cactus/issues)). We have a solid tagging system in place that should let you sort by just about whatever you want to find the types of issues that interest you.

We plan on continuing the academic efforts within Cactus.

# Maintainer Diversity

As is required, you can find our current maintainer list here:  [https://github.com/hyperledger/cactus/blob/main/MAINTAINERS.md](https://github.com/hyperledger/cactus/blob/main/MAINTAINERS.md).

Our existing maintainers are:

- Jonathan Hamilton (Accenture)
- Jagpreet Singh Sasan (Accenture)–NEW THIS QUARTER
- Peter Somogyvari (Accenture)
- Izuro Sato (Fujitsu)
- Takuma Takeuchi (Fujitsu)

Note that we did add Jagpreet Singh Sasan as a maintainer as we said we would do last quarter.

# Contributor Diversity

We recommend the following for detailed contributor information: [https://lfanalytics.io/projects/hyperledger%2Fcactus/dashboard](https://lfanalytics.io/projects/hyperledger%2Fcactus/dashboard). Thanks Ry (and now, the whole LFX team)!

Our contributor diversity has increased this quarter and is trending in a positive direction despite the fact that this was a short holiday quarter.

Nothing to see here people, move along!
