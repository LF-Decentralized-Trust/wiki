# Overview of Proposal

One of the motivations for projects to get to Active status is that being in Active status is a requirement for having a "First Major Release". The reason for this requirement is that historically First Major Releases have been associated with significant Hyperledger expenses related to performing a security audit, getting approval from the TSC, and engaging in communication activities to promote the release. At the same time meeting all the Incubation Exit criteria can be challenging for projects even though the software they are producing might be well developed enough to otherwise qualify for a first major release.

This proposal is to replace "Major Releases" with "Promoted Releases" which effectively separates all the activities currently associated with First Major Release (and subsequent ones) previously mentioned from issuing a major release. This provides more flexibility in deciding what gets promoted and how the code gets released. In particular this allows projects to have major releases while in Incubation, reducing the pressure on projects to move to Active status to do so and saving Hyperledger expenses.

# Formal Proposal(s)

Replace "Major Release" with "Promoted Release" (whether First or subsequent).

A promoted release is a release of an active HL project with extensive support by the HL organization. This support typically includes things like a security audit, a licence scan, legal review, and official marketing. It is important to note that this is not exclusive and such activities may be conducted at other times at the discretion of the TSC and/or LF staff.

[The criteria for Promoted Releases remain the same as the ones currently defined for First Major Release](Criteria-for-First-Major-Release_21437994.html) but Promoted Releases do not require explicit approval from TSC.

Projects in Incubation can have major releases that are not Promoted Releases. Conversely, Promoted Releases are not limited to major releases.

Promoted Releases are expected to be initiated at the request of the projects.
