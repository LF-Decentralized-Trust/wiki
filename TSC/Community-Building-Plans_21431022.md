# Technical Oversight Committee : Community Building Plans

Created by David Huseby, last modified on Jan 08, 2019

**NOTE:** This is a rough draft and work in progress, feel free to add/modify the contnt.

Effective community building has to done deliberately because critical mass is almost never achieved organically. A successful open source project goes through distinct phases much like a successful corporation does. They usually start in an incubation phase where the goal is to scratch an itch. Once a minimum viable product is created, the project passes into production phase where engagement with users becomes a conscious effort to move the project forward. The next phase is adoption phase where the project expands the number of users by expanding features and usefulness. At each stage, the community surrounding the project is crucial to preventing the project from failing.  The community is different in each phase and an overarching community development plan is the guide for evolving the community from one phase to the next.
