  - Subject: Hyperledger DCI Survey
    
    At Hyperledger, "All are welcome here!" Having a community that has a culture of encouraging people to voice their diverse opinions is crucial for the long term success of the project.
    
    **Today we are launching a [survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/DCIWGsurvey) to help us understand our community better.**
    
    We need to hear from you. Whether you are a frequent or occasional contributor, past or present we want to know more about you and your experiences here at Hyperledger.
    
    Diversity, Civility, and Inclusion can cover many different community health issues. The DCI Working Group will be using this data to help guide our efforts over the coming year. We plan to release results from the survey at the Hyperledger Global Forum March 3-6.
    
    Thanks for taking this survey. This one simple action is an important contribution you make to continue building a healthy open source community.
