### Announcements

### Items of discussion

### Quarterly updates

- Iroha
  
  - DCO issues are resolved.
  - Arnaud: Makoto-san said that he chose C++ because he thought that it would be more attractive to developers than Go/Python.
  - Aleš: Being the only platform in C++ does have some advantages because finding C++ developers is easier however it isn't happening yet. We're looking into why that it is. Likely because companies are waiting for the 1.0 release before dedicating resources.
  - Andrei: From the performance perspective there are lots of potential benefits.
  - Alesš: working with Polkadot and they think C++ is an interesting addition to the space.
  - Ry: the TSC had set a mechanical stop for 1.0 based on DCO conformance and now that they have met that, they are officially 1.0 and congratulations.
  - Congrats all around.
- Identity WG Update
  
  - Mark: one of the things Ry and I are looking at regarding maintaining participation, we noticed you're running meetings in two time slots to be timezone friendly.
  - Vipin: my aim in creating two time slots was to create one that was more friendly to the APAC region as well as one more friendly to american and european. Participation in the regular call has increased. Participation in the APAC time slot is low but steady. Trying to promote the APAC call on the India and China PSWG but seeing low participation. How do we grow the APAC partiipation? Maybe we get more engagement from the LF/HL reaching out to APAC members to participate more.
  - Chris: when collaborating on a deliverable, more email and more interaction is probably a better thing. Calls can be useful, but they are sometimes difficult to get engagement. We need to find better ways of async collaboration.
  - Vipin: we use the document as the center of the collaboration effort which hasn't been without its problems. Maybe use github for this purpose.
  - Nathan: can you comment on how the partnership with the ethereum enterprise alliance has worked out and how the DIF 2.0 reorg is going?
  - Vipin: had a demo of the DIF universal resolver. keeping a close eye on the credentials work and the indy agent working. As for EEA, we had a couple of meetings where we bridged with them but we've lost some momentum. We're trying to restore the collaboration effort.
  - Dave/Chris
  - Nathan: if you're working with the DIF, they are moving over to the LF and they are looking for ways to open up their development process and we can help them do that.
  - Bauhua: there's a mailing list for the China PSWG and WeChat group that is a better way to get engaged with the Chinese community. Mailing list is the best way, WeChat second.
