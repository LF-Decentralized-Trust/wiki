Created by Tracy Kuhrt, last modified on Oct 31, 2019

**Status**

RESOLVED 

**Outcome**Use New [TSC Decision Log](TSC-Decision-Log_21437418.html) page for summarizing all proposal statuses in combination with the new template**Minutes Link**[2019 10 31 TSC Minutes](2019-10-31-TSC-Minutes_21437424.html)

# Overview of Proposal

Determine the best way to capture decisions that have been made by the TSC.

# Formal Proposal(s)

A new template will be created in the TSC space that contains the following:

- Page Properties
  
  - **Status** - contains the status of the proposal valid values:
    
    - PROPOSED - specifies that discussion is underway
    - READY FOR VOTE - specifies that the proposal has been finalized and is ready for the TSC to vote
    - RESOLVED - specifies that a decision was made by the TSC
  - **Outcome** - captures what was decided
  - **Minutes Link** - provides a link to the minutes where the decision was made by the TSC. The minutes will have the vote result (e.g., unanimously approved)
- Overview of Proposal - Contains an overview of what we are trying to solve with this proposal
- Formal Proposal(s) - Contains the formal proposal(s) that the TSC will vote on
- Reviewed By - Checkboxes for the TSC to reflect that they have looked at the proposal

A new page (TSC Decision Log) will be created where decisions will be captured. This page will also house all proposals (pending and closed) as subpages underneath it. The page will have a button that will be used to create new proposals from the template created above.

All subpages under Closed Topics will be moved to the TSC Decision Log page.

All subpages under the Pending Topics will be moved to the TSC Decision Log page.

All existing decision pages will be labeled correctly – **`decision`** label will be used to represent all proposals (regardless of status) and `closed` label will represent resolved proposals.
