The increasing adoption of EVM-compatible technology within financial services and the accelerating trend of tokenization of assets are some of the key drivers for enabling a collaboration space for enterprise users of Besu and code contributors of Besu to come together to **support and help shape the evolution of Besu**. The interests of these two groups are a perfect match for collaborating on the adoption and success of [Hyperledger Besu Project](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/besu/).

- **Enterprise users of Besu** in need of tech capabilities that meet enterprise requirements
- **Code contributors of Besu** aiming to maximize the value and adoption of Besu

The **mission** is driving working sessions for enterprise users and code contributors to come together for:

- Identifying challenges that enterprise users face when operationalizing Besu for enterprise use cases
- Defining new features and enhancements that drive alignment between Besu and enterprise-level requirements

The **main deliverables** expected to come out of this WG include, but are not limited to:

- A prioritized and detailed list of enhancements of existing features of Besu
- A prioritized and detailed list of new features of Besu
- A prioritized and detailed list of technical limitations of Besu
- A list of recommended practices of Besu for enterprise use cases

These deliverables will shape an inventory of **use-case agnostic enterprise features** and **non-functional requirements** that code contributors of Besu can leverage for future releases of Besu.
