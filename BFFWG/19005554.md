# Besu Financial Services WG : Working Document: Privacy Requirements Survey

Created by Carlos Vivas, last modified on Sep 20, 2024

# Goal &amp; Background

Per discussions during the WG General Meetings (on Aug 29th and 30th), it was decided to pivot to use a survey to try to collect insights from the group. The goal is to define a survey that helps define and identify privacy requirements from enterprise users of Besu. This information will shed light on limitations of existing privacy features of Besu, as well as kick-off discussions about whether or not some requirements are to be solved from the network / infrastructure layer of the web3 stack.

There are several challenges to conducting this survey. These were discussed during the Aug 30th meeting (recording available at: [07 - WG General Meeting | August 29th &amp; 30th](19005551.html))

Co-Chairs will open the survey design to the group. This is why this document has been created. Members will use **comments** to share suggestions and recommendations.
