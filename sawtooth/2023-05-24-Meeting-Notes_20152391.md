    - compare agenda from April meeting 
      
      [https://docs.google.com/document/d/108b0LvennbRiXLLs8jHUE1X0gS7hC58y19Ku3hCPHw0/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/108b0LvennbRiXLLs8jHUE1X0gS7hC58y19Ku3hCPHw0/edit?usp=sharing)
  - [James Barry](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/5eac6d069ce9ee0b8957d517?ref=confluence) PR for the TOC report is not filed, but the document is good to go.  James will file the PR
  - Joseph Livesey - work to refresh and fix the `sawtooth-poet`  build is ongoing.
  - [Kevin O'Donnell](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/712020:467a7a2e-44a7-4eba-86d6-9f0ee6d16778?ref=confluence) - long-running testing
    
    - still working on contributing a vanilla version of BTP's helm chart. This will include a Helm test which runs a battery of tests against the deployment.  This can be wrapped in a scheduled job to deliver a relatively constant load.
- Actions carried over
  
  - we need a solid description of the toolchain in use by the projects (docker, docker-compose, etc.)
  - [James Barry](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/5eac6d069ce9ee0b8957d517?ref=confluence) will scan the available documentation and media for mentions of the RAFT consensus to identify what needs to be touched when we deprecate/decommission it
- Items Discussed
  
  - a speculative idea to refactor the POET-CFT version to be based on Time Stamp Authorities 
    
    - [https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3161](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3161)
    - [https://freetsa.org/index\_en.php](https://freetsa.org/index_en.php)
    - Not as secure as SGX, but more secure than CFT alone
    - Would like to talk to Mick Bowen about the algorithm to sanity-check the idea
  - `sawtooth-core:main`  is still the 1.99 version and has yet to be switched to the `1-3`  branch content. \`1-3 \` is where the current work is going.
  - [William Katsak](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/557058:b4ec0925-0ec6-4473-8808-669c8af3f950?ref=confluence) Hedera-based consensus is getting ready for release
    
    - when ready announce on #sawtooth-contributors, and #sawtooth
  - `rust-protobuf`  is currently unmaintained, which is a problem. The popular choice appears to be `prost` 
    
    - should look in to see how disruptive it will be to migrate sawtooth-sdk-rust to `prost`
  - Ryan Roberts - has been working on a tokio+TMQ-based sawtooth-sdk
    
    - will work to get it published so people can see it and form an opinion
    - current known gaps
      
      - sawtooth client-side only
      - i.e.
        
        - no TP
        - no consensus side function
        - no signing
    - should look and see how disruptive it would be to incorporate this into `sawtooth-sdk-rust`
- New Actions
  
  - Mark Carroll - In order to get ahead of the types of questions we are getting on #sawtooth, Mark will review the documentation for the setups of the various "getting started" and identify the gaps
  - Ryan Roberts - check the impact of migrating to prost on `sawtooth-sdk-rust`
  - Ryan Roberts - check the impact of incorporating/enhancing sawtooth-sdk-with the tokio+TMQ version
  - Ryan Roberts - get the tokio+TMQ SDK published somewhere so it can be poked at
