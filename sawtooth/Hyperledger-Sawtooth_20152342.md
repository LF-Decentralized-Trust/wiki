**Description**Hyperledger Sawtooth offers a flexible and modular architecture separates the core system from the application domain, so smart contracts can specify the business rules for applications without needing to know the underlying design of the core system. Hyperledger Sawtooth supports a variety of consensus algorithms, including Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) and Proof of Elapsed Time (PoET).

Originally contributed by Intel, Sawtooth is a blockchain suite designed for versatility and scalability. Distributed Ledger Technology has potential in many fields with use cases from IoT to Financials. This architecture recognizes the diversity of requirements across that spectrum. Sawtooth supports both permissioned and permissionless deployments. It includes a novel consensus algorithm, Proof of Elapsed Time (PoET). PoET targets large distributed validator populations with minimal resource consumption. Transaction business logic is decoupled from the consensus layer into Transaction Families that allow for restricted or unfettered semantics.

# Key Characteristics

- Pluggable consensus algorithms (Change consensus on the fly by transaction)
- Includes Proof of Elapsed Time (PoET) consensus
- Write smart contracts in almost any language
- Ethereum contract support via Hyperledger Burrow integration
- Supply Chain example out of the box
- Parallel transaction execution for added throughput

# Mailing List

There is a [sawtooth](https://lists.hyperledger.org/g/sawtooth) mailing list but the most active discussions are on Discord.

# Process Notes

- Release Notes: Release notes will be provided for release 1.0 and thereafter.
- The project will follow the Hyperledger security bug process and identify any security vulnerabilities fixed in the release.
  
  - Security bugs: Security bugs can be reported to [security@hyperledger.org](mailto:security@hyperledger.org).
  - The Sawtooth project will follow the HyperLedger security process and will respond within 14 days.
- Static analysis: The Sawtooth project will follow the Hyperledger security process and address bugs found by static analysis in a timely manner.
- Dynamic analysis: The Sawtooth project will perform dynamic analysis prior to major releases will follow the Hyperledger security process and address bugs found by static analysis in a timely manner.
