<!--THE END-->

- [Joseph Livesey (Deactivated)](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/62816e8604eb160068349638?ref=confluence)  - work to refresh and fix the `sawtooth-poet`  build is ongoing.
- [Kevin O'Donnell](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/712020:467a7a2e-44a7-4eba-86d6-9f0ee6d16778?ref=confluence) - long-running testing
- we need a solid description of the toolchain in use by the projects (docker, docker-compose, etc.)
- [James Barry](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/5eac6d069ce9ee0b8957d517?ref=confluence) will scan the available documentation and media for mentions of the RAFT consensus to identify what needs to be touched when we deprecate/decommission it
- [Mark Carroll (Deactivated)](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/62bec3fd118b20bee2bd3e53?ref=confluence)  - In order to get ahead of the types of questions we are getting on #sawtooth, Mark will review the documentation for the setups of the various "getting started" and identify the gaps
- Ryan Roberts - check the impact of migrating to prost on `sawtooth-sdk-rust`
- Ryan Roberts - check the impact of incorporating/enhancing sawtooth-sdk-with the tokio+TMQ version
- Ryan Roberts - get the tokio+TMQ SDK published somewhere so it can be poked at

  - Need volunteers to triage
  - Other projects use issue &amp; pr labels to govern the process - should we? Is there an example of a project that does it well and relatively painlessly?

# Notes &amp; Actions

### TOC Update

- April update has some pending questions specifically wrt Maintainers list
- Next update is due July 27
  
  - ACTION: [Kevin O'Donnell](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/557058:78a23eba-27ce-4832-8ae4-d22c3b705e98?ref=confluence), Mark Carroll - circulate the update by July 20 on discord for comment
  - ACTION: [Kevin O'Donnell](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/557058:78a23eba-27ce-4832-8ae4-d22c3b705e98?ref=confluence) , Mark Carroll - to do the TOC update PR

### Maintainer list

- the maintainer qualification rules need a refresh, we'll need to wait until [Shawn Amundson](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/557058:2e7d95e7-feba-4f98-9e87-ae7a151bcdc8?ref=confluence) comes back from vacation to do that
- we should do a poll of existing but idle maintainers to see if they would like to get back involved. Otherwise, inactive maintainers should be moved to an Emeritus section of the maintainer list to recognize their contribution while being clear about the active maintainers
- [Ry Jones](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/557058:078cecfc-fb17-4d9a-8759-b5b74efa6850?ref=confluence) 
  
  - Maintainer activity in the last year:
    
    - Active:
      
      - agunde406 vaporos peterschwarz rbuysse cianx shannynalayna isabeltomb jsmitchell dcmiddle
    - Inactive:
      
      - RyanLassigBanks TomBarnes aludvik chenette dplumb94 eloaverona danintel ltseeley rberg2 ineffectualproperty

### Toolchain

- the principal issue driving the toolchain stuff is the confusion around docker-compose v1 and v2
  
  - v1 and v2 have slightly different YAML parsing that shows up in awkward places
  - container ids are different between v1 and v2
  - Where possible/necessary we should update the YAML \`version\` fields in the various docker-compose files which either behave identically regardless of the binary version used OR have versions which demand one or the other docker-compose releases (either too high for v1 or too low for v2)
  - Switching to docker-compose v2 everywhere will require a thorough going through of the various test setups in all the projects

### Documentation

- ACTION: [Mark Carroll (Deactivated)](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/62bec3fd118b20bee2bd3e53?ref=confluence) to take over reviewing the docs for RAFT references
- ACTION: [Mark Carroll (Deactivated)](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/62bec3fd118b20bee2bd3e53?ref=confluence)  continuing to review documentation

### SDK

- ACTION: Ryan Roberts - will publish the alternate tokio+tmq implementation for discussion ASAP
- ACTION: Ryan Robers, et al - will open a PR converting the existing sawtooth SDK to use \`prost\`

### LR TEST

- ACTION: [Kevin O'Donnell](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/557058:78a23eba-27ce-4832-8ae4-d22c3b705e98?ref=confluence) Pr a Helm chart with \`test\` implemented.  Then the test can be run on any k8s infrastructure

### Github Issues

- ACTION: discuss labels for issues if any are missing
- ACTION: various - we will review/triage all the issues, and label them
