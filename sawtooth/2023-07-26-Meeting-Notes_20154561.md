# Agenda

## Review of actions from the last meeting

- Q3 TOC update - From Discord I see that [Shawn Amundson](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/557058:2e7d95e7-feba-4f98-9e87-ae7a151bcdc8?ref=confluence) and [Andi Gunderson](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/5a62116ab12a51717aac433f?ref=confluence)  will be doing this for this month, correct?
  
  - Yes, it is currently up as a draft here [https://github.com/hyperledger/toc/pull/142](https://github.com/hyperledger/toc/pull/142), after the meeting I will make any updates and mark it as ready for review - Andi
- TOC update for Q2 [Shawn Amundson](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/557058:2e7d95e7-feba-4f98-9e87-ae7a151bcdc8?ref=confluence)  [Kevin O'Donnell](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/557058:78a23eba-27ce-4832-8ae4-d22c3b705e98?ref=confluence) 
  
  - The [previous report](https://github.com/hyperledger/toc/pull/128) has still not been merged, as there are outstanding questions that need addressing
- DONE - [Ryan Roberts](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/712020:9f7673b7-7146-479d-ba1c-b7a4184c1d6b?ref=confluence)  
  
  - async-sawtooth-client is now available for review at [https://github.com/btpworks/async-stl-sdk](https://github.com/btpworks/async-stl-sdk). It is based on tokio / tmq / prost / k256 and has no OpenSSL dependency. It has the capabilities of the current ZmqMessageConnection, along with additional higher level features.
- [Ryan Roberts](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/712020:9f7673b7-7146-479d-ba1c-b7a4184c1d6b?ref=confluence), et al - will open a PR converting the existing sawtooth SDK to use \`prost\`
- DONE - the maintainer qualification rules need a refresh, we'll need to wait until [Shawn Amundson](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/557058:2e7d95e7-feba-4f98-9e87-ae7a151bcdc8?ref=confluence) comes back from vacation to do that
  
  - we should do a poll of existing but idle maintainers to see if they would like to get back involved. Otherwise, inactive maintainers should be moved to an Emeritus section of the maintainer list to recognize their contribution while being clear about the active maintainers
  - Looks as if [Andi Gunderson](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/5a62116ab12a51717aac433f?ref=confluence) has moved this forward
- [Mark Carroll (Deactivated)](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/62bec3fd118b20bee2bd3e53?ref=confluence) to take over reviewing the docs for RAFT references
  
  - ACTION - [Mark Carroll (Deactivated)](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/62bec3fd118b20bee2bd3e53?ref=confluence) to make a PR to remove that `sawtooth-raft`  references
- [Mark Carroll (Deactivated)](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/62bec3fd118b20bee2bd3e53?ref=confluence)  continuing to review documentation
- [Kevin O'Donnell](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/557058:78a23eba-27ce-4832-8ae4-d22c3b705e98?ref=confluence) Pr a Helm chart with \`test\` implemented.  Then the test can be run on any k8s infrastructure
- discuss labels for issues if any are missing
  
  - [https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-core/issues/2456](https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-core/issues/2456)
- Review/triage all the issues, and label them
