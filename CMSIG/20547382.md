## Abstract

Structured Finance is more than $2T industry that suffers from information asymmetry and layers of cost, as the lender, issuer, servicer, rating agency, trustee and investor share data. Intain brings all these parties on a common HL Fabric based platform, for one version of truth and then uses smart contracts to model all deal features, resulting in an integrated and an automated structured finance administration platform.
