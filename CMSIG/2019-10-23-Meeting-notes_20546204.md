## Notes

- AntiTrust Policy and Code of Conduct
- All members on call at 10:05 introduced themselves details can be found under attendees
- [Vipin Bharathan](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/70121:4ac24c34-2385-41a8-8881-61e7a75c6d1e?ref=confluence) introduced the concepts around CDM
- [Manivannan Pillai](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/5a6887cec2b7dd3533e4ab77?ref=confluence) gave an presentation around CDM and concepts, mainly from the vantage of Swapshub efforts
  
  - How is CDM different from FpML-(uses XML) (uses JSON, generates composable products, events, focuses on off chain standards for hashing (CDM hash) so data can be made interoperable between chains and systems)
  - [Ron Quaranta](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/557058:986e556c-2be0-4336-8590-bd079def990c?ref=confluence) asked about the hash (which reveals that the transaction hash needs to conform to CDM standard),
  - [Ron Quaranta](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/557058:986e556c-2be0-4336-8590-bd079def990c?ref=confluence) also asked about whether any production systems adopted CDM. [Manivannan Pillai](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/5a6887cec2b7dd3533e4ab77?ref=confluence) responded that the Contractual Product is the most complete, but no production systems yet- However big organisations are members of ISDA (big banks-Barclays, BNP Paribas, JPM, Citi etc. DTCC, ISMA also participated in this effort)
  - Creates a background for on-chain storage of data (especially extraction of **lineage**)
  - Aids in legal arbitration and clear evidence about contracts for regulators and in case of dispute- allows easy access to this data
  - Briefly touched upon the status of digital assets trading, settlements and custody solution being built by Swapshub under CDM
  - Extension of CDM from Contractual products to other types of securities (Equities, credit products, FX etc.) currently only functions as underlying
  - How standards help interoperability.
  - [Manivannan Pillai](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/5a6887cec2b7dd3533e4ab77?ref=confluence) will share appropriate slides after a consultation with [Vipin Bharathan](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/70121:4ac24c34-2385-41a8-8881-61e7a75c6d1e?ref=confluence)
  - More detail can be found in recording.
- We could not go into cash on ledger details but touched on the subject briefly
- We went into status of existing projects; since most of the project owners were not present we went through several projects and [Ron Quaranta](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/557058:986e556c-2be0-4336-8590-bd079def990c?ref=confluence)expressed interest put himself in as collaborator on a couple of projects, namely tokensisation and regulation.
- We need to discuss how to collaborate further on these.
