# Financial Markets SIG : 2020-12-02

Created by Vipin Bharathan, last modified by Tomaz Sedej on Apr 02, 2024

Main Event: A retrospective &amp; prospective. A look back at the 2020 activities as well as the view forward.

01. Build on some of our successes : eThaler and the eThaler code could be used in the Climate Accounting from the Climate Accounting SIG's [Net Emissions Token Network.](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CASIG/pages/19006546/Emissions+Tokens+Network)  There are also other possible linkages between climate action and currencies, including local currencies such as InvolveMINT and schemes which link climate action to central bank currencies directly, such as the [Global Carbon Reward proposal](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VlmnJNc0_wjEUdosWq6BAVe9MCHuP-JL/view) (there's also a [Bloomberg article about it](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2020-04-22/kim-stanley-robinson-let-the-fed-print-money-for-the-planet) from SciFi writer Kim Stanley Robinson.)
02. Public discussion on the topics
03. Insurance Group: plans for 2021
04. Work on MPC based custody solutions, otc.digital will propose a lab for this work.
05. Jumpstart more tokens and token definitions, contribute some ideas back into IWA.
06. Get more presenters on interesting topics
07. Work on open source utility functions specific to Capital Markets for integration into smart contracts
08. Interoperability work: extend xcsi and work on interoperability issues between different kinds of digital tokens and digital currencies.
09. Work with other open-source efforts like FinOS.
10. Collaboration with other groups in Hyperledger (we mentioned climate SIG before).
