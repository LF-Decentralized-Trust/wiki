General introductions

- Elena works for ExactPro who provide services for. Post Trade and now blockchain based solutions. They were concentrated on Corda, but they now have some need to support HL based frameworks like Fabric etc.  They use open source tooling with a service layer support .
- Natalia Garcia who is also the vice chair of the group- Works on issuance,  and is a member of working groups for blockchain. Issuance: products through BBVA and Santander for approx Euro 50 MM small issuances: Fintechs like Origin-x and ?. Once she gets clearance to share she will.
- Mani Pillai works for Swapshub, and is the proposer of the workshop on TTF digital token for a simple use case- taking it from definition to usage in ERC-20 or some such token standard in Besu. Details of this proposal are to be found in the link in the agenda. Swapshub is working on an ISDA CDM based platform and also a Digital Asset solution.
- Ravikant Agrawal is from Infosys: He wanted to include compliance considerations either on or off-chain in any Token solution.
- Srinivasan Muralidharan recently moved from State Street to Manetu. He indicated that the CPM work in Manetu is still in stealth mode and will be made clearer later. However State Street still continues their Blockchain activities although they have pivoted to a different area, dealing with custody and some other areas. Their main concern was the lack of cash on chain.
- Vipin Bharathan sketched out the general aims of the SIG, the projects that we are working on, the difficulties in getting participation from participants in calls every two weeks. A rough roadmap was shared as well.
- The first workshop will need a separate call (Mani's suggestion) and possibly a way to model a simple token. The code can be housed inside Hyperledger labs.
- We went into the details of the two proposals, and agreed that we could get some participation from collaborators between calls through the use of the wiki and the mailing list.

The SIG update was created for Q4 of 2019, the next update will be in 6 months.
