As the first call of the 2022 for the US/Europe area, we went over

1. All our resources for community and collaboration
2. Our decision to split the call alternating in two separate time zones (a call in the APAC region and another in the US/Europe region) 10 am EST for US/Europe and 10 pm EST for APAC, on Wednesdays- biweekly. There would thus be one call in each region roughly once a  month.
3. We discussed work-items and a work-plan for 2022, anchored in the wiki and in the labs. Most of the items had champions who joined the call and talked about the items.
4. 1. Karen laid out the meta data about the SIGs and various ways to interact
   2. Sandy Aggarwal is leading an effort to get Feedback from the Fed paper- which an offshoot of the CBDC project inside the CMSIG
      
   3. David Rowe-Francis (at a late hour from HK) discussed plans to get the work on Green Bonds from BIS into a presentation in the APAC zone. He also touched on the work being done in HK on a short questionnaire (7 questions) which may have intersection points with the Fed. Lastly he brought up the paper from the CBDC skeptics from the "House of Lords".
   4. Stephane Mouy shared the work that he is doing with Offline mode for wallets and tied it to CBDC, we will share his paper and maybe have a presentation from him on our SIG meeting
   5. Stephane briefly discussed e-CNY as well, 20% adoption (250 million downloads of the e-CNY Wallets) as well as technical underpinnings in the list of patents; the worry that there is massive surveillance and the concept of tiered wallets were also brought up. With the lowest tier capable of offline peer-to-peer transfers.
      
   6. Mani Pillai shared an ESMA link, as well as promised to talk about his own Greenbond proposal and remarked on the work we had done with eThaler and its subsequent use in Climate Accounting SIG.
   7. Guy Hostetler as the conscience of social implications provided his input.
   8. Marc Liberati gave a perspective on NFTs, which are considered for providing a decentralized assurance of the tokens and their conversion to Fungibility
   9. neferti lab has been approved; the vision is to construct a framework for safely generating tokens and the middleware for token management that handles the decentralization.
5. The recording on youtube will be linked into the meeting page, much thanks to the Hyperledger folks who are working on automating this process.
