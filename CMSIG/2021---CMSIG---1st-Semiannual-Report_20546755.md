Vipin Bharathan: SIG Chair

## CMSIG Overall Health

The CMSIG meetings are held every two weeks and are generally well-attended. Meeting topics and guest speakers drive attendance.  The Vice-chair [Kirthi K](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/712020:cdf2c19a-9f68-45e0-82c7-86c8b2799fb2?ref=confluence)  has been confirmed. Kirthi is the convener of our Insurance sub-group. 

## Issues

We have a diverse set of members and have had success with well-attended presentations. We do have the challenge of gender and location diversity. There have been some improvements in location diversity.

## Overall Activity in the Past Quarter

The CMSIG is very well attended. We have had thirteen meetings from Jan 1 until today (Jul-28-2021). We are in the vanguard of Capital Markets thought. The themes include all topical items in Capital markets namely CBDCs, FMI, DeFi, Tokenization, Automation etc.  CMSIG participation was also key in the cross-SIG TaskForce. eThaler and the use of ERC-1155 continues to find adherents in new projects like Firefly. Jagadeesh Babu, a key contributor to the eThaler project passed away due to Covid-19. His memory lives on in the eThaler project.

## Participant Diversity

This is a very diverse membership with global representation (including, but not limited to, member participation from China, East and West Coast US, England, Canada, Switzerland, India, and the different countries within the EU). Gender diversity is still a challenge. We want to invite more presentations from women leaders in Capital Markets. We did open with a presentation from a woman and had a couple of women led presentations. Still 2 or 3 out of 13 is a dismal percentage and we need to improve.
