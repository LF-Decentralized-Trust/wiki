# Financial Markets SIG : 2022.07 - FMSIG - Quarterly Report

Financial Markets Special Interest Group (CMSIG)

Vipin Bharathan: SIG Chair

## FMSIG Overall Health

Interest in our SIG continues. Two major developments took place this half of the year. One, we split the SIG meetings between APAC and US/Europe. Second, we renamed the SIG to [Financial Markets SIG](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/CMSIG/Financial+Markets+SIG-+Name+Change). We have a mix of presentations and projects. Continuing project for this next year include NEFERTI (renamed from NIFTY) a cross-silo initiative that continues to get interest. Next half of this year we will participate in creating a cross Institution sandbox for CBDC.  Renewed Interest in DeFi (AMMs, Yield Farming etc.) resulted in a new sub-group being proposed to focus on DeFi.

## Issues

The name change came with issues; migration is not easy with the platforms that support the SIG (Confluence &amp; Mail Lists). We do have the challenge of gender diversity. Hope to address this partially with the choice of a vice-chair.

## Overall Activity in the Past Two Quarters

The FMSIG is very well attended. We have had 11 meetings from Jan 15 2022 until today (July-15-2022) (the period covered by the report). A new subgroup has been proposed  - The DeFi Subgroup.

## Participant Diversity

We opened very strongly with some women led presentations,  last year. We do need to increase presentations from women leaders in the space. Please send those recommendations our way. We need to improve this mix. Gender diversity is still a challenge.

This is a very diverse membership with global representation (including, but not limited to, member participation from China, East and West Coast US, England, Canada, Switzerland, India, and the different countries within the EU).
