# Financial Markets SIG : TTF Workshops

Created by Vipin Bharathan, last modified on Jan 27, 2020

Proposing two workshops using TTF.

[TTF Github](https://github.com/token-taxonomy-initiative/TokenTaxonomyFramework)

[Besu Github](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu)

1. Go from modeling a simple token using TTF to implementation using Besu.
   
   1. [Manivannan Pillai](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/5a6887cec2b7dd3533e4ab77?ref=confluence)Â  made a suggestion to build a simple Capital Markets token example using the TTF and pursue it all the way through to implementation in Besu.
      
      The Token designer that TTF is developing is not ready yet.
      
      At this stage we can clone the TTF repository and work on a token artifact.
      
      We have members who are experts in Capital Markets and blockchain. We need to put in a concrete technical roadmap for this simple example to spur collaboration. We could house it in Hyperledger Labs in the beginning.
2. [Custody workshop](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/CMSIG/CUSTODY-Workshop)
