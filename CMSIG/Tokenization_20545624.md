## Token Taxonomy Initiative

In our taxonomy section we briefly allude to Token Taxonomy and the Token Taxonomy Initiative.

A comprehensive Token Taxonomy Framework (TTF) has been developed by TTI to guide the modeling of tokens from a business use case. This allows clear thinking around generating a fairly rigorous specification. Tooling for creating developer specs are also available. This Framework could reduce the gap between ideation and the creation of a solution in code. It is not attached to a specific language, dlt or business domain. TTF allows for composition of tokens using basic templates; these templates come with some commonsense safeguards. TTF is a work in progress, although [a version 1.0](https://github.com/token-taxonomy-initiative/TokenTaxonomyFramework) is currently available.
