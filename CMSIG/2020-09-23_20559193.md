## Goals

- Discuss future plans for the SIG
- Springboarding CBDC through Smart Cards The Hyperledger Capital Markets SIG continues its work on CBDCs. This time for a disconnected approach using Smart Cards. "Springboarding CBDC Into Reality" by Sergio Mello, CEO of Tangem. A fresh look at emulating the peer-to-peer nature of cash. Tangem is completing the required VISA and Mastercard certification processes to enable digital assets and CBDC to ride on the existing EMVCo rails. Tangem focuses on secure microelectronics, modern cryptography, decentralization, open-source software, and interoperability to provide a platform for industrial-grade solutions. This is especially true in leapfrogging in developing countries to solve the last mile problem for CBDC.

## Future Talks
