See event page on LinkedIn: 

## Abstract

01. Intro and announcements - 2 mins
02. Name Change proposal - 5 mins
03. 1. The range of concerns and the topics of the group have gone beyond pure Capital Markets into short term money markets, including payments and financial infrastructure. This unified approach should be reflected in the name of the group.
04. DeFi subgroup proposal - 30 mins
05. 1. Mike McCoy formerly of the Healthcare SIG, now in BlockDaemon is proposing a DeFi sub-group. This is of specific interest to us, since DeFi is in the heart of the crypto-sphere and because of recent troubles on that front. He will make a presentation for all those who are interested.
06. Project Hamilton feedback - 10 mins
07. 1. We have not been able to get together on collaborative answers, let us share our thoughts.
08. NEFERTI project- status - 10 mins
09. 1. We have been getting a slow start on this project since it aims to disrupt the entire infrastructure and it is difficult to know where to start.
10. AOB - 10 mins
