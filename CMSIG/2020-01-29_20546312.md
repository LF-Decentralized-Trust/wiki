## Notes

[Junji Katto](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/557058:83096c66-ae87-42aa-8ced-ef69b2647897?ref=confluence) works in innovation dept of Itau bank, discussed about Brazilian DPR and some use cases w.r.t Capital markets on HL as well as some PoCs

Other participants: we have extensive notes on their backgrounds

[Ron Quaranta](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/557058:986e556c-2be0-4336-8590-bd079def990c?ref=confluence) of WSBA brought to our attention the book published on regulation of CM. He agreed to help in getting access to the physical and pdf versions of the book. 

He will not have bandwidth for the tokenization aspect, but will work on creating a matrix representing the regulations.

Some concerns- should we focus on crypto-currency regulations? Capital markets regulations? AML/CDD? CBDC?

As the topic is vast, maybe condense the main themes. ([Vipin Bharathan](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/70121:4ac24c34-2385-41a8-8881-61e7a75c6d1e?ref=confluence) )

GFIN meeting in New York during blockchain week. Mostly closed door, but we will get more data from them.

[Vipin Bharathan](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/70121:4ac24c34-2385-41a8-8881-61e7a75c6d1e?ref=confluence) Asymmetry in power among regulators for technology (it is dominated by attorneys and policy folks- not enough technologists with a voice); maybe a good idea to have upgrade capability in the initial governance structure

[Manivannan Pillai](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/5a6887cec2b7dd3533e4ab77?ref=confluence) discussed the open sourcing plans of ISDA to put CDM into the open, as well as Regnosys' Rossetta. They will have other language implementations (like Solidity/)

[Vipin Bharathan](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/70121:4ac24c34-2385-41a8-8881-61e7a75c6d1e?ref=confluence) presented a roadmap for the TTF token based implementation (see the slides link above). [Junji Katto](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/557058:83096c66-ae87-42aa-8ced-ef69b2647897?ref=confluence) said that he was working on a use case token which he hopes to bring to us. Also TTF was an independent but membership based organization.

Debate about HL labs vs. TTF github for housing the TT sample. For Implementation HL Labs felt to be better, as Besu folks can come in as well as the labs charter allows for open governance for all to participate. TTF has linited outside participation. [Vipin Bharathan](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/70121:4ac24c34-2385-41a8-8881-61e7a75c6d1e?ref=confluence) promised to share the governance framework around labs as he is a labs steward.

[Manivannan Pillai](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/5a6887cec2b7dd3533e4ab77?ref=confluence) says that Besu has testnet as well.

[Wei Cheong Neo](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/712020:c732515b-3c90-46e2-b540-58919d0a6647?ref=confluence) asked about differences between Fabtoken &amp; TTF- TTF is more generic and only focuses on a standard for a composable token.
