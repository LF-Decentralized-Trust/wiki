## Chat

***Listen to the recording for answers***

From jimmason : question &gt; any 3rd party rule changes in this new model for how they use BOE CBDC for their clients?  
From Eugenio Reggianini : I have a question for William, I am focusing on standards. I think that one of the main point is how business global standards like iso20022 could interact with other more technical initiatives like iso/tc 307. what’s your opinion about?  
From Junji Katto : how the CBDC initiative is accelerated by the open banking that is in place in Europe? on the other hand how GDPR may add complexity to privacy on CBDC?  
 From Mohan Venkataraman : What concepts can we borrow from the success of the Bitcoin project and network.  
 From Paulo Rodrigues  I’d like to ask a question regarding common points between Wholesale and retail.  
From Deb DasBidhar : Hi William, I had got a chance to attend the CBDT discussion paper webinar in April. I believe, whether CBDT will be built on Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) or traditional/centralized model was still undecided. Is there a direction that has been finalized yet ?  
From Kirthi Gogulamudi : What are some unique challenges in Retail and institutional CBCD’s

## Notes

Paulo Rodrigues's notes: According to William, although wCBDC might lack of market demand, it might occur before rCBDC because of similarities with current RTGS systems, easier regulatory framework changes and market forces from other competing geographies.

On the rCBDC side, the agenda depends on the rise of demand.

Vipin: It might be useful to have these repeat periodically as we advance.
