# Central Bank Digital Currency

Many Central banks are contemplating the release of CBDC. CBDC drives most of the institutional interaction with Central banks today, this can be seen as "Wholesale CBDC". This is a well understood concept and is used every day. CBDC for retail is what we are really talking about when we say CBDC.

## ECB PoC on CBDC

The European Central Bank organized the experts from ESCB to create a PoC under their EuroChain research lab. Working with Corda and Accenture to implement this.

What are the important features of this PoC?

- Anonymous as cash (at least that is the claim) and does not earn interest (or more importantly does not get slammed with negative interest)- especially for lower valued transactions
- Uses separate Intermediaries for custody and interaction by retail customers; ECB or Central banks do not interact directly with retail customers
- Only Central Banks can issue CBDC
- AML/KYC authority controls the amounts and destination (payee) since embargoed individuals can never receive payments.
