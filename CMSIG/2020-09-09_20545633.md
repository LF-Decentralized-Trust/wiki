1. A discussion of the [Insurance Markets sub-group](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/x/ZYA5AQ) proposed by Kirthi of Civitas
2. Discuss whitepaper on CBDC sparked by the eThaler project. The authors are Mani Pillai (otc\*Digital &amp; Vipin Bharathan dlt.nyc and advisor to otc.Digital), eThaler received a lot of interest in the press and in many other venues, including among central bankers. There will be a demo of eThaler at a later meeting. The whitepaper is still in draft. Please read it (or skim it as it is a 36 page paper) and we are eager to hear your comments for improvement. The paper was sent out as an attachment to the group. A new direction in the implementation of an integrated CBDC solution is proposed in the whitepaper. The whitepaper is not just words, implementation of some of the components are available in hyperledger labs and elsewhere. We hope to change the conversation around CBDC towards open standards and open source.
3. gits announcement by Sateesh V.
