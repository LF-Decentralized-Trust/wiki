## Minutes

eThaler Status:

Main phase I objective complete

- Truffle testing over
- Java Interface complete
- Besu testing with Java interface complete privately (deploy, mint, burn etc.)
- We will test with more participants
- We can now transfer the code from private github to the public
- We need DCO for this transfer - more of a HL governance activity
- Aim to do this before the next meeting
- UI needed for the demo to be powerful
- Presentation or webinar under the DH

Custody

- David - Hubsecurity - key management platform (ultra secure)- security tokens, smart contract
- Multisig approvals- policy manager, hand held device- policy for multi-sig approval process
- Multisig is happening at the wallet level- much better before the blockchain
- Some do some dont (much more control outside)
- Bitco different - custodian service is provided
- HS does not provide custodian service- open source not provided
- eThaler will be compatible- but the MPC platform is usually proprietary.
- Open Source can be extended
- Here is the core function of CBDC from a SC , but MPC
- France- French bank- they are highly secretive-
- Hurdles and requirements for custody etc. is stringent (EU based)
- Kirthi - Brexit prevents - EU union is needed, ask legal consultant
- Service provider vouched by French Bank
- Credit Agricole (DCM contacts?) are not aware due to size of bank.

Standards around custody

- Common principles for standards document with TTF
- We can start after 1 month or so- integrate into the asset-
- Already custody as a standard- token definition compliance function, roles function and limitations
- Note about custody to Marley
- Wyoming regulation was passed- aspects for custody perspective- critical asks for legal regulations
- Wyoming and Switzerland as regulations, specific things (decent list of legal requirements)
- SEC &amp; SIFMA(?) control of assets, settlement guarantees, custody functions 15-C3 (SIFMA 19-7 rules? Operable in US markets
- Oscar Jofre from Kore Conx - book on digital assets, custody- free thinking of asking him to present
- Follow up with Kore Connex

Future presentations

- CBDC presentation
- Next week Consensus distributed - huge virtual conference Panel with Junji Katto moderating
- IEEE - from 8:30 am onwards- HL virtual booth as a sponsor

UI

- UI plan to do it? Platform demo by Mani- but does not focus on CBDC
- ERC 1155 vs ERC 20 - Fed interaction is better modeled with ERC 1155- Direct payments to the public, 1155 - does not mean we have to implement
- What should the UI look like?
- Different roles (Central Bank, Dealer A or B)- support
- Central Bank : Minting, burning,  pause  transferring, Register dealer, check the balance, get decimals
- Logged in as dealer - cannot mint burn
- Ideally should interact with Java Interface+Keystore
- Model the UI using the easier to collaborate in eThaler labs.
- Simple and intuitive UI is important for testing-
- Bonds and Equities -
- Help with Bond definition? By Natalia.
