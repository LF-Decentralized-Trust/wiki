## Event

**Warehouse Receipt Finance: IoTs to Strengthen Data backing Warehouse Receipt Lending**

Ashish Anand on Warehouse Receipt Finance

Ashish is the CEO of Whrrl

**How WHR Lending Works**

Warehouse Receipt (WHR) Lending is a system of financing working capital to Farmers, Commodity Traders and Producer Companies against commodities deposited in warehouses and pledged with the lenders.

Whrrl is a B2B2C Blockchain PaaS startup working in the arena of Warehouse Receipt Finance that helps Farmers, Traders &amp; Producer Companies in raising working capital to cover crop cycles ranging from 6-12 Months.

Whrrl collects data from warehouses with the help of IoT devices and puts that data on Blockchain creating an immutable record of Collateral and its attributes like Ownership, Quality and Location. This helps lenders make informed decisions, cuts the role of intermediaries and reduces the risk of fraud. This also helps scale a marketplace, reducing cost for farmers and reducing collateral risk for lenders.
