Suggested activities

- Vipin: develop a taxonomy for capital markets
- Murali: +1 on taxonomy, give an overarching introduction, definitions,
- Mani: blockchain spans products and industries, identify or formulate a data standard to look at gaps
- Vipin: CDM is an excellent standard, DAH in Australia using ISO20022 which is widely used elsewhere, India stack standard, and other nations or international organisations like IMF, BIS, Euroclear etc. develop a standard map (to map from standards to taxonomies). In the SIG proposal, suggests we add in taxonomy first as an activity and map individual groups to data standards and regulations
- Stan: +1 on taxonomy, common data format is a common issue, he's also looking at CDM. Another thing to consider is use cases, pick ones that are a good fit for capital markets, in contrast to others that are not good fits. What does it mean to be a good use case for blockchain in Capital Markets. Should we use an objective measure without cutting off true innovations.
- Kelly: Likes idea of taxonomy, but suggests identifying 3 real obstacles that we're running into this space, go deep on what are the pain points so that a wide audience can have input on how to help with those roadblocks to adoption in the Capital markets space. Can be technology, compliance, corruption. Perspectives from CEOs and founders are invaluable, specificity to Capital Markets.
- Topic leads
- - Vipin: Taxonomy
  - Stan: use cases
  - Kelly: obstacles
  - Mani: data standard
