# Financial Markets SIG : Trade Finance Securitization

Created by Vipin Bharathan, last modified on Feb 11, 2020

An [article on medium](https://medium.com/dlt-nyc/trade-finance-blockchains-3b2626e9ab45) that lays these arguments out in detail can be found here.

Trade Finance securitization and the Blockchain: 

1. - Trade Finance has suffered from a funding gap, since large banks who are the primary providers of financing are loath to deal with SMEs (Small and Medium Enterprises), there is a $1.5 Trillion funding gap [(ICC)](https://iccwbo.org/media-wall/news-speeches/icc-calls-un-action-address-trade-finance-gap/) and [ADB](https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/publication/521096/adb-brief-113-2019-trade-finance-survey.pdf).
   - The gap is larger for women and minority owned SMEs.
   - The “duration” of Trade Finance is shorter.
   - Many banks hold  TF on their books, requiring capital to be locked up
   - There is a lot of money looking for a home due to low and negative interest rates.
   - Trade finance can be securitized, but this can be an onerous process
   - The secondary market is less developed due to lack of ratings which prevents investment by institutions
   - Many Trade Finance blockchain consortia exist, but interoperability of these is an issue, solutions for these may include networks of networks (proposed by Marco Polo, and Unbounded- although by the rules we may be prohibited from mentioning specific products)
   - **Unlocking value is possible through  a combination: increasing flow, creating mechanisms for easier and more accurate ratings (automatic rating schemes using AI or smart contracts or both), interoperating between consortia- all possible through increased access to higher quality information in a standardized way through Blockchain** - this is our thesis (not in any of the references)
   - This will have the effect of closing the TF gap, increasing trade finance especially for the smaller Enterprises, reducing capital requirements for banks by stimulating a healthy secondary market; allowing more capital to enter the arena (from Institutional Investors)
