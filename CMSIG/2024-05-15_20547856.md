## Content:

US Gov't And Stablecoins: Over the course of a few years, the official narrative on stablecoins has changed. Particularly, the introduction of the term “payment stablecoin,” in US Government reports and Congressional legislation redefined stablecoins from a potential threat to a potential boon in payments, legitimizing and maybe even supporting stablecoins.
