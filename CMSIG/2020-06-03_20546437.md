## Minutes

1. After the anti-trust and code of conduct we had intros from all around, details in audio
2. Spoke about the creation of IWA- spun out of EEA, IWA has a three pronged approach towards standards in a token-based ecosystem
   
   1. TTF based token standards
   2. Private and platform neutral components standards
   3. Standards for private data and AI use to derive analytics for business-value as well as for reporting
3. eThaler is available in the opensource repo, latest addition is a web3 based java client that also implements a wallet
4. We will have demos soon. Private/more widespread demos
5. May add a layer of UI to the web3 client: Vipin to specify for implementation
6. Junji will present on equities in the next meeting, Sateesh volunteered to add his insights regarding FMI
7. Kirthi raised the issue of Insurance risk transfer securities and Insurance in general, he wants to propose a SIG.
8. For now Kirthi will work on creating a project inside CMSIG for insurance.
9. Debate about how far we can take a token definition of a security (Bond or Equity),
   
   1. stick to a generic token def and make the contract detailed (as in existing eThaler token),
   2. get some detail into token def including new behaviors or properties.
   3. It is recognized that we cannot all of the different and specific types of contracts to be expressed as tokens following the TTF standard.
   4. In all cases put in a link to the contract when we define using ERC 1155.
