***Innovation Tagline:**  USE OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES IN ELECTRICITY GENERATION SOURCES THAT USE RENEWABLE SOURCES MOVING TOWARDS DIGITALIZATION 4.0*

**Project Keywords:**  (#INNOVATION, #MANAGEMENT OF RENEWABLE ASSETS, #AUTOMATIZATION, #INTELLIGENT CONTRACTS, ELECTRICAL MANAGEMENT, OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE)

## Project Members

1. AIGELEC

## Project Description *(no more than 1,000 words including graphics)*

The proposal of our project is to use in electricity generation systems that use renewable sources such as solar photovoltaic and wind, in Administration, Operation and Maintenance of these systems integrating software and hardware using Artificial Intelligence, industrial IoT and Blockchain.

### Problem

a. We do not find a product on the market that is designed to integrate three disruptive technologies, to manage, operate and do predictive and corrective maintenance of power generation systems with non-conventional energy sources that help reduce fuel use fossil fuels and in the decarbonization of energy production, making these systems increasingly more efficient and therefore collaborating in reducing global warming.

b. There is no specific product on the market for what we are proposing.

c. we have large companies worldwide that have similar products and developments such as SIEMENS, ABB, LEGRAN, SCHNEIDER, but not specifically mentioned to AOM(Administration, Operation and Maintenance.

### Solution

a. Integration of Artificial Intelligence with a neural network not only to extract information or data, ensuring a complete automation of the system, which will learn and make autonomous decisions taken from the industrial IoT with embedded systems and with the Blockchain, we ensure the generation of tokens and the adoption of intelligent contracts in the administration, operation and corrective and predictive maintenance Applied to electrical generation systems that work with non-conventional energy sources such as photovoltaic solar energy or wind energy in distributed systems, intelligent networks, distributed measurement systems with or without of storage (Batteries), initially from 0.003 MVA to 5 MVA and moving towards electric adoption 4.0.

b. because we do not have a product on the market with the specifications and uses that we are promoting

c. the minimum viable product is for a three-phase industrial system of 0.0003 MVA

### Accomplishment and Team

a. Rigoberto Gómez Jaimes Electrical Engineer, 20 years of experience CFO and Fredy Baquero Venegas Electrical Engineer CTO

b. The main need is to get specialized personnel to speed up the development of the prototype, since on the way to the business idea we have had to learn and teach what we have learned on the fly and this has delayed us in addition to limited economic resources for the development of this 

b1. Not finding help from specialized personnel who will speed up the development and implementation of the business idea in a year, which is the projected time to have a functional prototype and product certification in development
