# Community Events : Submitting a Bootcamp

Created by Silona Bonewald, last modified on Apr 25, 2019

Propose a Bootcamp!

BootCamps are Curated Unconferences.  We suggest reading up on how these are run to be sure this is right for you.  The main difference is that we prepare the GRID in advance.   The goal is not to have the grid 100 percent full before the event. But it should have enough content that participants know what to expect.  We also focus on getting Volunteers on-boarded weather it be introductions to the project, white papers for the work groups, standards discussions, Translation work, or basically anything volunteer related.

Also see previous bootcamps - like [the BootcampHK](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/BOOTHK/BootCamp+-+Hong+Kong) that was in Hong Kong to see how they are typically run.

This Submittal form can have blanks for you to fill in later.  But the more you show that you have community support, the more likely it is to be accepted.
