## Project Description *(no more than 1,000 words including graphics)*

by introducing a new scheme of an environmental economic accounting to the playfield(s) of KidZania ( MEX ), we ( kids ) can raise deeper understanding of our economy / ecology on our planet and can explore future possibilities in our society further more.

### Problem

human being has to end Capitalism, but we still do not know how yet.

### Solution

by re-evaluating every economic activity based on purchase power particle of GHG emission equivalent, and by mimicking life and occupational experiences at KidZania, with a brand-new KidZania crypocurrency, we may get perspective views and solutions about how we can reimagine problems of Capitalism, therefore, we could define Wellbeing up-to-date.

### Accomplishment and Team

needs mentor(s) and an app development team

### Project Plan

first of all, we have to negotiate / persuade with KidZania ( MEX ) and obtain their HQ's permission.
