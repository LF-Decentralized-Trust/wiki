# Community Events : Contribute-a-Thon BAF specifics

Created by Priyanka Vats, last modified by David Boswell on Dec 08, 2020

**Reward &amp; Recognition :**

For BAF we plan to explore virtual rewards :

#**Options for Reward &amp; Recognition****Description****Can do today?****Cost?**1Award contribution certificatesEach contributor gets a certificate of contribution/participation from Hyperledger labsyesNo2Give vouchers or creditsDiscount vouchers to be used across Hyperledger certificationsyesYes3Recognize in a newsletter A newsletter featuring the contributors is publishedyesNo4Digital badge Digital badge that can we used on social network profile pics maybeTBD5Give subscriptions to coursesFor eg. pluralsight etc.noyes6Tech magazines annual/half year subscriptions  
noyes

**Duration** :

1 sprint or even lesser 

**What are the team's needs:**

What could community members do to help BAF?

- They would become users
- They would fix bugs or they would create new features
- They would create documentation and/or translate documentation
- They would become evangelists (for example someone could give a BAF presentation to a meetup in a language or in a time zone that BAF team members can't do)

Contributor challenges:

- There is a learning curve – for example, people need to know Ansible, Kubernetes, etc in order to get started
  
  - [Integrate to MiniFab](https://github.com/litong01/minifabric)?

**Scope** :

1. Technical tasks / issues on Github 
   
   1. Contributor pathway: (for example: read this blog post, go to the list of good first issues, etc)
   2. Contributor persona: (for example: someone already familiar with Kubernetes)
2. Article in an online publishing forum such as Medium
3. Blogpost
4. Deployment video
5. [Custom digital badges](https://github.com/hyperledger/chat-assets)?

**WHAT IS A DEPLOY-A-THON** ?

  A deploy-a-thon is like a hack-a-thon; however, instead of focusing on  building an application or a working piece of code, it is **focused on deploying a network .**

**Deploy-a-thon : Pathways based on Personas :**

**Marketing**

Pre Phase:

Intro blog post to raise awareness (written by BAF team)

Intro pre-recorded video for blog post, social sharing (created by BAF team – done already for Consensus event)

Intro presentation to a webinar or meetup (presented by BAF team, organized by Hyperledger staff) – Meetup or video on BAF, why it was created, what it aims to achieve to raise awareness

Email campaign (staff to repurpose content from blog post)

Social (staff to repurpose content from blog post)

Meetups:

- BAF + Indy: [https://www.meetup.com/Hyperledger-Victoria/](https://www.meetup.com/Hyperledger-Victoria/) – hosted by Stephen Curran
- BAF + Fabric: Hong Kong - connect with Julian
- BAF + Besu: Somewhere in Europe – Connect with Thomas and Vijay re suggestions about Europe locations
- Meetup blurb:
  
  - BAF is a new Hyperledger Labs project that is an automation framework to consistently deploy production-ready DLT/Blockchain networks on existing Kubernetes clusters. The BAF team is interested in speaking at a virtual meetup for around an hour to cover a project intro, talk about how to configure this for use with Indy and do a demo plus Q&amp;A.
    
    We would want a 1 hour slot : 1. Introduction , need and architecture 
    
     2. Platform specific configurations
  - 3\. Live demo 4. Q&amp;A. late July or early August.
    
    For more details: blog link

During Phase:

Social (staff to repurpose content from blog post)

Email campaign (staff to repurpose content from blog post)

Blog post to highlight work that has been done and draw interest for others to get involved (written by BAF team)

Homepage mention (HL staff owns)

Post Phase:

Analysis metrics:

1. Number of new contributors (for a small enough set of new contributors it would be helpful to do a quick sketch of each person – who they are, where they work, why they are getting involved...)
2. Number of organizations contributing (this would need to come from discussions with the new contributors to learn more about who they are.  we could also combine this with the number above to see the number of contributors per organization to see how much internal interest and adoption there may be – is it just one person or many?)
3. Number of questions per week asked on the main communication channel – in this case the BAF chat channel (this would be a manual metric to gather but we'll look into something automated for going forward)
4. Website traffic on landing page and blog posts
5. Number of PRs on Github (And longer term it would be good to build a retention stat from this info to see if people show up and continue to contribute or drop off)
6. Number of community members attending planning call (this would also be a manual metric for now)
7. Possibly a social media metric about mentions for BAF
8. Note that usage and deployment metrics are challenging to gather with open source software so we are focusing on participation metrics

Blog post to recap results (written by BAF team)

**Planning :**

#PLANNING ACTIVITYStatus1Create a contribution pathway we want to use in the campaign – what are the steps we want people to take?  For example, read this blog post &gt; clone BAF repository &gt; pick a good first issue &gt; raise a pull request &gt; until the Pull request is merged // possibly different pathways for different personas In progress2Organize Enablement workshops to make community aware of pre-requisites of using BAF and improve the documentation and scripts from the feedbacks.Done3Create a good amount of "Good First Issues" to create a healthy repository of independent issues to work uponIn Progress4Review the information currently available about how someone can contribute to BAF and update or add more details and create new assets as needed.In Progress5Reach out to partners (all DLT platform partners) to spread awareness on project and contribute-a-thonTo Be started6Create a task force of maintainers and key contributors to monitor the number of issues, review the pull requests as they come and answer queries on chat.In Progress7Discuss on how to handle certain "What if" scenarios. 1) Too many pull requests, how to merge the code, 2) many people pick the same issue to work on, should that be controlled at the onset or the best code wins?In Progress8Discuss on campaign shout outs during the event (tweets, publishing a daily leader board until the event, etc.)To Be started9Determine how you will handle additions by contributors for items that were not in the original list of "known" issuesTo Be started10Establish a set of metrics we will use to track success of the campaign and contribute-a-thon and create a baseline report to show contribution levels before campaign starts so  
 that a post event metric comparison can help define the outcomes.In Progress
