# Community Events : Agenda

Created by Dan Middleton, last modified by Nathan George on Oct 09, 2019

# Topic Ideas:

- Transact mini-hackathon, a two hour coding project to...
  
  - connect a framework with transact southbound APIs
  - connect an interpreter/engine to northbound APIs.
- Ursa mini-hackathon: A two hour coding project to...
  
  - link a framework to libursa provided functions
  - build a POC using libzmix features
  - community discussion on libzmix API
  - Ursa packaging (libursa-dev) - iOS, Android, Redhat based, Debian based, OSX, Windows.
- Fabric Private Chaincode - Enhancing Chaincode Privacy in Hyperledger Fabric using Intel SGX
  
  - overview of the project and demo
  - how to use the run the code on github and how to create your first application
  - discussion on use cases
  - discussion (and possibly hackathon) on best integration strategies with new Fabric chaincode lifecycle
- Burrow
  
  - Upgrade fabric-chaincode-evm to latest Burrow (some minor interface changes)
  - Upgrade sawtooth-seth (unfork!) to latest Burrow
  - Discuss WASM extern standards... we have sabre/transact, eWASM, pWASM, etc. I think this needs an auxiliary answer other than 'just use transact' to interop with wider blockchain WASM users.
  - Something with Burrow's new web3 RPC! Including raw transactions (e.g. metamask works)
  - Implementing 'timing oracle' contract using Burrow SNatives - get time from a trusted group of Burrow validators - find a way to make work in other frameworks
  - Make this work in Burrow WASM and Sabre as PoC: [https://github.com/digital-asset/rusty-engine](https://github.com/digital-asset/rusty-engine) (DAML engine)
  - Burrow keys is becoming 'burrow warren' a wallet/light client. Can we integrate with Aries? What about GPG backends?
  - Public Ethereum 2-way-peg/connectivity (with Besu team?) in Burrow
- Contribution processes
  
  - I know it sounds kind of dry but getting a quick overview of the PR process for each project might be enlightening and help suggest some best practices. {*CBF: would like to discuss potential for aligning all projects around a single Git flow model to reduce barriers to cross-project collaboration).*
- Project code and management tooling
  
  - SCM and code reviews - e.g. Gerrit versus vanilla GitHub
  - Issue tracking - e.g. Jira versus vanilla GitHub
  - CI - e.g. Jenkins versus Azure Pipelines versus GitHub actions
- Discuss common repo structure
  
  - MAINTAINERS.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, etc.
  - Also probably sounds dry but useful to get everyone on a common repo language.
- Aries
  
  - Aries Introduction
    
    - Sovrin Intro Slides [![](plugins/servlet/confluence/placeholder/unknown-macro)](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17DOlkubSAa_oihSAQKCRnEPMSL6d6x1bxB4GG_aPr1w/edit#slide=id.g5df34f9a9c_0_0)
    - Aries Status Update [![](plugins/servlet/confluence/placeholder/unknown-macro)](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1QYb3spuBESih-6vIoSEQfjaeplxlZvQL-aGHujY3pz0/edit#slide=id.g647570cfe3_0_549)
  - How Aries works with your ledger.
  - Broad Interest in DID Communication, collaboration with the DIF community.
  - What encryption/signing is needed from Ursa?

<!--THE END-->

- Ursa - Quantify binding overhead viz. potential adoption by Fabric
  
  - Gary asked about the overhead to work though the c binding in the last TSC meeting.
  - Determine most likely usage (e.g. ECDSA signature generation and verification)
  - Hack together a quick test to compare Rust v Go for that usage
  - Sketch out RFCs for interfaces that projects want.
  - Build generic elliptic curve group testing tools.
- Recap and Report 
  
  - Quick report out on accomplishments of the summit
  - Include list of recommendations if any, for decision items to TSC.
  - Disseminate any project recommendations to project lists (i.e. we are not making decisions at the event)
- Convergence at Hyperledger
  
  - Brian's post [![](plugins/servlet/confluence/placeholder/unknown-macro)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GOtsuHPTdOo1BJbxgofB7u4JyBpD4Un7VnFfule1spY/edit?ts=5d9ad460#heading=h.nbm3d5udehb6)
