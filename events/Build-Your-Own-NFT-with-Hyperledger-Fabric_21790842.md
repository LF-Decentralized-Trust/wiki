**Workshop description:**

This two session workshop will start with an introduction to blockchain and NFT concepts and is appropriate for both a technical and business audience.  In particular, this session has been created for faculty interested in teaching about blockchain and NFT in their courses.  Join the first session to get an overview of how blockchain is being used in real world examples and learn more about non-fungible tokens. The topics for the first session will include:

- What is blockchain?
- What are tokens? What is an NFT?
- Technology landscape overview (enterprise perspective)
- Use Cases / Examples
- Obstacles
- How does this apply to you?  What skillsets are needed?
- Q&amp;A session

This [video about blockchain and NFTs from UCLA Professor David MacFadyen](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ayKshlZJ1Z9DZF4E9aVK2atFeknPuFdf/view) covers some of the basics to help you understand this new technology.

The second session is a technical workshop for developers that want a hands-on experience.  You will need to be familiar with the material from the first session to get full value from this technical session.  The second session will include:

- Basics of the Auction App which will be used in the workshop
- Auction App versus Typical public blockchain implementations
- Auction App code structure
- Hands on using the app - Launching, Registering, Creating an NFT, Transfer Transaction
- Home work on adding changes to support another type of media (e.g., music)
- Engaging with the Community and the Lab

Technical session will be run by - Mohan Venkataraman, Puneet Singh, Aashish Shrestha, Dilip Manjunatha, Sahinul Haque

The auction application code is being donated to Hyperledger Fabric Labs so it will be available to HBCU and the broader community to download, learn, and enhance outside the workshop.

**Participants in the hands-on technical session should check the following** 

- You would need internet browser installed on your laptop, we recommend using Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari
- Make sure your internet connection allows you to connect to open internet, as the hands-on session will be hosted on a public AWS address
- We would create NFTs from jpeg or gif files, so participants would need to have access to upload pictures of less than 2 MB size for the session
- Before the workshop we would be sending information regarding the URL to use during the workshop to all the participants.
- Make sure you are [registered on Discord](https://discord.gg/C7MFdn6W), and have access to the #workshop channel.

One of the facilitators will be available to answer any questions regarding the technical aspects of the workshop in advance or during the workshop at the #workshop [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/C7MFdn6W).

General questions about the workshop can be sent to the [Hyperledger Community Architect team](mailto:community-architects@hyperledger.org).
