### Solution

Derived from the current technical situation, the development of an interface capable of being able to insert each of the crossings made at the toll booths through electronic tolls in a private blockchain network is proposed, where in the same way it can send data of control figures to a network. public; Once the previous steps have been carried out, you can immediately filter and determine which operator the toll belongs to, complying with the interoperability process, leaving SFTP servers out, and adapting a queuing system that can comply with fault tolerance.

In order to comply with transparency in the transactions carried out and if it is necessary to request information directly from the private network to reconcile information that the regulatory entity may question, where the private blockchain will be its main source of information, NEAR blockchain will be used. public for the issuance of delivery document receipt of requested information, generating document as NFT, and can be used as unique proof, using IPFS as a file storage system, where in the same way the integrity of the generated document can be counted on.

With the foregoing, the acquisition of the NEAR Token by the client is determined to carry out requests to extract information directly from the private blockchain, said fee will be to meet transaction expenses for the creation of receipt delivery receipt; a web portal will be created where the transfer of funds can be made, which will be able to interact with the smart contract developed in NEAR.

Once the transfer of funds for the acquisition of information from the company/operator, a temporary channel will be created that will expose the corresponding information of the applicant, said information extracted from the private blockchain network.

Continuing with the flow of information transparency, said funds transferred through the NEAR token will continue to be transparent for the client, since they will be in a public network, said protocol was selected, since the cost of transactions is lower. to others such as ETHEREUM, in addition to the use of the Proof Of Stake (PoS) protocol, making transactions per second (TPS) more agile and faster.

The cost in the transactions of transparency of control figures, may be assumed by the company that will regulate the electronic toll booths, these figures being uploaded in accordance with what is proposed by it, that is, on a weekly or monthly basis, for validation by the the managing companies.

The infrastructure of the private network will be carried out through the use of AWS, assembling HyperLedger BAF as a framework, making use of Fabric, BAF is contemplated derived from the entire automation environment created.

The benefits of the solution are several, where the most important are:

1.- Transparency and Integrity in the information collected from the costs of the operators,

2.- If there is a loss of communication, it is avoided having to make unnecessary queries to the Ledger or DB engine, since the management of queues applies fault tolerance concepts.

3.- It is guaranteed that the interoperability tags are delivered to the operator that belongs to it, removing the SFTP servers.

4.- Information may be reconciled by operators, if the figures do not coincide with what is requested by the authority.

5.- Information on control figures can be uploaded every month end.

So far there is no solution that can provide a hybrid network to interoperability problems, and that also gives control to the government authority, which can reconcile the information provided by the operators, the above derived from the monthly billing; therefore, it seeks to provide solutions based on Transparency, Traceability and Payment.

### Project Plan

There are severals activities to make more robust this project and diferents skills to hand on, perhaps the second phase "Invoice" will be interesting to tha will be necesary to create ETL's to get information on realTime from Private Blockchain to create invoice from differents operators.

Skills necesary to grow project are:

Designer UX/UI

Dev Backend python, typescript

Dev Front-End Vue

Dev Fabric and NEAR protocol

Tester 

Devops

To plan for industry option will be necesary to get feedback from customers from ETC(TELEPEAJE) experts from government México, and show them MVP to get information from differents Toll Operators.
