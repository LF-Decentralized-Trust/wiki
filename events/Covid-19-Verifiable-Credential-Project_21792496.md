## Project Description *(no more than 1,000 words including graphics)*

The coronavirus pandemic has quickly become a public health problem and has revealed the deficiencies of our society, not only in Mexico but worldwide. When SARS-CoV-2 arrived in Mexico, it reached a country undergoing one of its most important political-economic transitions, where the economic and health systems were during reorganization, where it was not clear how the different government agencies would work.

One of the first obstacles faced by health personnel and authorities was a society that did not trust the people taking care of it. Thousands of skeptical Mexicans even claimed that the pandemic would not reach Mexico, driven perhaps by a false a sense of security provided by the country's geographical remoteness from the epicenters of contagion up to that point: China and Italy. The first reported case in Mexico was on February 28, 2020. Since its first reported case, the Mexican government gradually increased measures to avoid the increase in the number of cases. These measures included social distancing, closing schools, and the cancellation of sporting events and other gatherings. Almost in parallel (in early March), the Mexican newscasts were flooded with images of people buying scandalous amounts of toilet paper, antibacterial cleaning products, and gels, with the most sophisticated buying medical equipment. We had not yet entered the period of social distancing and there was already a shortage of supplies. Mexican health personnel throughout the country, from different institutions and levels of care, had to face the early stages of the pandemic without proper protective equipment. Despite this, health personnel continued to provide care to their patients knowing that they did not have the necessary safety provisions, that they were putting their own lives at risk. Although this was common knowledge, citizens continued to buy protective medical supplies, even those citizens that were low-risk for the virus.

One of my thesis is that there is no a cost-effective tools that help increase vaccination registry even there is a federal government has been released a web system to register before get access to the vaccination process, but there is no a user friendly system that can identify if the Mexican citizens are already vaccinated or not and this process might improve the timeliness of vaccination, reduce revaccination due to unverifiability of previous immunizations, and provide reliable data for decision-making, e.g., where to search for unvaccinated individuals in order to ensure the right to equitable immunization. Also enable monitoring of the immunization process with a view to optimizing ancillary activities. For example, a Vaccination Verified Credential provide accurate and timely information, thus facilitating planning of resources and activities. Furthermore, from a process standpoint, knowing the productivity of each vaccinator could help improve workload distribution. These tools also allow detection of problems in implementation of existing regulations (e.g., administration of vaccines to nontarget populations) and assist in directing training and supervision activities.

### Problem

Mexico is currently 16th in the world in terms of confirmed coronavirus cases and it has the fifth-highest number of Covid-related deaths, behind the USA, Brazil, India and Russia, according to Johns Hopkins University figures, and there is not an accurate way to identified people who are already vaccinated or not, In the past month, Mexico has registered more than 300,000 active cases and the number of patients occupying hospital beds has doubled. Just a month ago, on December 15, Mexico had 18,000 active cases but in a single day on January 16, 19,000 were added. During that timeframe, hospital admissions have risen from 15% to 29%

Mexico has a serious problem of registering and monitoring the information of citizens vaccinated against Covid-19. All records are not digitized, they are captured by hand and on paper, with the possibility of having considerable margins of error.

There is no application that can verify your vaccination status, this information is not available to the general public, which makes it difficult for companies, schools, shopping malls, movie theaters, airports, government agencies, etc. to implement policies and procedures to take care of the health of citizens and protect the vulnerable population in the strongest waves of contagion, in short, I consider that having a mobile application on a smartphone that can be shown as a verifiable credential would help the creation of mitigation strategies to avoid massive infections in the most critical seasons of the year

### Solution

We have been working in our First Minimum Viable Product. - Digital Vaccination Passport - Covid 19 Care4U: Digital Vaccination Passport (DVP) is a secure and confidential record based on distributed ledger technologies (DLT) that allows keeping a permanent record of the history of vaccines and controlled and confidential diagnostic tests completely managed by the citizen / Patient. The POS is designed to facilitate sanitary and epidemiological control strategies, allowing organizations to generate policies and plans to minimize the spread of infectious diseases such as COVID-19. Profits: -Instant Verification: Our Blockchain and Artificial Intelligence algorithms automatically verify the information, eliminating the need for intermediaries. -National and International Regulatory Compliance: We use encryption and cryptography technologies following GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA and other relevant world-class regulations. -Easy to Use: A user adds recent test results with one click and digitally signs the update, confirming the authenticity of the data. The data is permanently stored on the blockchain. -Distributed Database: each member of the ecosystem can be integrated as a node and become a validating entity that allows, with the consent of the patient / citizen, to share vaccination data in their employee file systems with the rest of the ecosystem participants ( doctors, hospitals, clinics, public or private health entities), that provide reliable information about the health of their patients, citizens, or employees. But we need to test it into a real environment and that’s where we need some resources to fine tuning our app.

This project is currently being incubated in the InnovaUNAM system, which is one of the most prestigious entrepreneurship program at one of the most recognized universities within Latin America Care4U (Our official name project) is ready to carry out the proof of concept and we have plans to take it to a scale of 20,000 records to validate the product and evaluate the results. We have been in a continuous improvements phases last year that the MVP needs to adapt to effectively address the return to the "New Normal" in Mexico first within our research, and in the near future we have plans to distribute it to all the organizations and dependencies (public and Private) not only in Mexico but all Latin American Countries that choose to adopt this solution. For that we need sponsorships that allow us to launch the minimum viable product in a productive environment within Hyperledger and where security tests, consensus protocols and computing power can be developed, to demonstrate the viability in the near future, likewise we already have a business model ready to be able to present it if would be necessary, for further information please go to the attached PDF Presentation.
