# Community Events : Deploy Fabric on Kubernetes with Hyperledger Bevel

Created by David Boswell, last modified on Jun 20, 2023

**How to Deploy Hyperledger Fabric on Kubernetes with Hyperledger Bevel**

**Time:**

- Tuesday, June 20, 2023 at 8 AM - 11 AM Pacific

**Recording:**

- [Recording of Bevel workshop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUC12ahY5_k)

**Presenters**

- Sownak Roy, Accenture
- Suvajit Sarkar, Accenture
- David Viejo, Kung Fu Software

**Workshop description:**

This workshop will provide an in-depth hands on discussion and demonstration of using Bevel and the new Bevel-Operator-Fabric to deploy Hyperledger Fabric on Kubernetes.

Hyperledger Bevel is an automation tool for deploying consistent, production worthy DLT platforms on cloud. It provides three key aspects – security, scalability and acceleration for DLT deployments.  Hyperledger Bevel currently supports deployment of R3 Corda open source and enterprise, Hyperledger Fabric, Hyperledger Indy, GoQuorum and Hyperledger Besu. It uses ansible scripts and helm charts responsible to achieve the desired DLT network state on Kubernetes and uses Flux GitOps for automation.

The Hyperledger Bevel developers have recently integrated hlf-operator, a Hyperledger lab, into [Hyperledger Bevel](https://www.hyperledger.org/use/bevel) and have renamed it to [Bevel-Operator-Fabric](https://github.com/hyperledger/bevel-operator-fabric).  Adding Bevel-Operator-Fabric is an important milestone for Hyperledger Bevel and a step towards the redesign of Bevel with support for Kubernetes operators to achieve DLT (distributed ledger technology) network deployments and automation.

Bevel-Operator-Fabric is the first of the different sets of Kubernetes operators that Hyperledger Bevel will ultimately support. As the name suggests, it is a Kubernetes operator for managing Hyperledger Fabric networks. Bevel-operator-fabric enables developers to define Hyperledger Fabric components in the form of custom resources and associated controllers to manage the lifecycle of those components.

**Preparation:**

We recommend having a Cloud Kubernetes available if you want to follow along with the hands-on parts of the workshop and we also recommend reading through the [Bevel Getting Started guide](https://hyperledger-bevel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gettingstarted.html).
