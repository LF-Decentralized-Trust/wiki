## **Solution**

**a.** **Describe the solution :** 

           AsalReviews - is a blockchain-based review system that provides transparency, trust, self-regulated, and distributed systems by providing immutable data stores for reviews where the opinions of every customer are valued and noticed. Asalreviews can be beneficial to the service provider to maintain their reputation and build a better relationship with customers by winning over their trust which would help them in their business growth eventually. We would be using **artificial intelligence(AI)** to detect and eliminate fake/biased reviews and to provide credit scores to consumers. AsalReviews provides a feature to report/flag reviews if the customers find the reviews abusive/fake in any sense.

                                                                                                                     ![](attachments/21793363/21793364.png?height=400)

In AsalReviews one of the stakeholders would be a group of moderators/auditors to identify fake reviews to maintain the integrity of the system. There could be two sets of users - Reviewers and Moderators. Reviewers will be promoted to Moderators after meeting a certain set of expectations.

AsalReviews can provide major online platforms with a way to integrate with our system so that customers can have trust in what they are reading as reviews. This project has huge potential in various domains - tourism, health care, lifestyle, e-commerce, and other areas of life. To start with, we would be targeting the **tourism category**.

#### b. Explain why your solution is better than current state-of-the-art or existing solutions

 1) **Non-blockchain solution**: The issue with existing non-blockchain solutions is centralization, non-transparency, central authority is under control, guidelines for reviews are not shared publicly, and filtration of fake reviews is not disclosed to the consumers. 

 2) **Blockchain solution**: A prominent issue in all the existing blockchain solutions is the storage of the reviews. Storing the reviews on the Ethereum blockchain is very expensive, and is infeasible. Our solution is better as we are using a blockchain framework other than Ethereum, which would be less expensive and more performant.

**c.  Does your solution have any Environmental, Social, or Governance impact?**

    Our solution has a social impact. Due to the decentralized and distributed nature of blockchain, trust and transparency can be guaranteed to the consumers, which would in turn result in a better consumer experience. Since consumer now trusts the service provider from which they are availing services, it would result in an increased consumer base and higher revenues for the service provider. 

As our solution "asalreviews" is not using energy-intensive blockchain platforms like bitcoin, and Ethereum, it doesn't have any negative impact on the environment.

## **Project Plan**

**a. What does the project growth plan look like? What timelines are you looking at?**

**PHASE: PROTOTYPE (1.5 Months) - Completed**

      Phase 1 - Blockchain Network Infrastructure setup.

      Phase 2 - Developing chain code.

      Phase 3 - Implementing back-end and front-end for CRUD operations.

      Phase 4 -Testing End to End.

**PHASE: LAUNCH (2.25 Months)**

      Phase 5 - Create off-chain DB for analytics.

      Phase 6 - Populate off-chain DB with background batch processing for Rich queries.

      Phase 7 - Implement Artificial Intelligence(AI) for the detection of fake reviews

      Phase 8 - Training and validating model

      Phase 9 - Product launch - Beta-testing

      Phase 10 - Pitch the idea to different service providers for pilot implementation.

**PHASE: GO LIVE (TBD)**

      Phase 11 - Deploy to production for customer use.

      Phase 12 - Onboard different service providers onto AsalReview as part of a consortium.

**b. How do you plan to engage the open-source community :**

- We are planning to create **awareness** in the open-source community, by talking about our solution on various platforms, such as Linkedin, and Hyperledger meetups, and also taking support from ambassadors and other experts.
- We'll launch this project in the public domain so that everyone can start using it without doing any setup, and can create issues and make **contributions** on the GitHub platform.
- We will propose a new **Hyperledger Labs** project for our project to attract like-minded people.

**c: How will the project be sustained? what are the skills that need to maintain and grow the project?**

The project can be made sustainable, with the constant contribution of members having different skill sets, such as technical, functional, and marketing.

Skills to maintain and grow the project:                                                                      

- Need support in the Business model to make it self-sustainable.
- Artificial intelligence expertise needs for data modeling and prediction.
- Need guidance from domain experts to make a market fit solution.

**d. How do you plan for industry options?**

AsalReviews showcases limited functionality to guest users(no login required) making it hassle-free for new joiners and if they find it beneficial they can register as a new user. Users would be provided incentives based on certain criteria so that they feel motivated to create reviews on our platforms.

Once we have a sufficient consumer base on "asalreviews", we would be proposing our solution to different service providers, starting with the tourism industry, and will onboard them on our platform making it truely decentralized.
