# Community Events : Diversity and Code of Conduct

Created by Silona Bonewald, last modified on Apr 30, 2019

Remember all events are held under the [Hyperledger Code of Conduct](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/HYP/pages/19595281/Hyperledger+Code+of+Conduct)

Your bootcamp is also more likely to be acceptable if you indicate a Diversity Plan.Â  It is not required just more likely to be endorsed!
