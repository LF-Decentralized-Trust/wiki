**Meeting Details**

- **Day:** July 7 (the first Tuesday of each month)
- **Time:** 16:00 UTC / 9 AM pacific (feel free to suggest alternate times)
- **Dial-in:** [https://zoom.us/j/4336690939](https://zoom.us/j/4336690939)

**Agenda**

- Introductions
- Preventing abuse during virtual meetups
  
  - Summary of what happened on recent Hyperledger Africa virtual meetup
  - The screen annotation feature has been disabled
  - Please review the [Managing Zoom Meetings guide](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/HYP/pages/19595316/Managing+Zoom+Meetings) for more information about how to moderate a Zoom call as host
  - Please also review [Hyperledger's Code of Conduct](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/HYP/pages/19595281/Hyperledger+Code+of+Conduct) and report any behavior you see that is not appropriate during a meetup
- YouTube live streaming
  
  - This is possible when using one of Hyperledger's Zoom accounts for a virtual meetup.  A YouTube admin needs to be present though to start the stream, so doing this for a meetup will depend on availability of Hyperledger staff who are YouTube admins.  Please contact David in advance to look into setting this up for a meetup.
- Contributors badges
  
  - Note that we are looking to pilot a small contributor badge program and this could apply to Hyperledger meetups.  For instance, meetup organizers, meetup speakers and meetup attendees could earn badges in a system once it is running.  For an example, here is a mockup of a badge for a meetup speaker:

- Report back from Wiki Improvement Sub-Group
  
  - Improve the meetup creation experience by making all resources easier to discover and use
  - Improve the meetup content experience by making content from past events easier to find
  - Perhaps a better name would be Meetup Experience Work Group
  - Let me know if you'd like to join and I can add you to the invite.  The call is also on the [Meetup Calendar](https://lists.hyperledger.org/g/meetups/calendar).
  - If people are interested in other work groups, feel free to propose ideas.  For example, an Event Template Work Group create recommendations on event length, number of speakers, how to incorporate interaction elements like [polling](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/213756303-Polling-for-Meetings), etc.
- Lessons learned in the past month
  
  - What have you seen that has worked well or that could be improved?  Are there things you think we should be trying, such as break-out rooms?
- Other topics?
  
  - Feel free to add other topics to the agenda
