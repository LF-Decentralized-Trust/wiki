**Workshop description:**

Antoine Toulme, Senior Engineering Manager at Splunk and a Hyperledger Besu maintainer, leads this technical workshop about how to operate and extend the Hyperledger Besu Ethereum client.

This workshop will contain two separate sessions -- one for operators and one for developers.  You are welcome to stay for the whole event or just dial-in and stay for the content you're interested in.

Operation session (8AM to 10AM Pacific)

- 30 minutes intro to Besu - what it does, how it works
- 30 minutes on Besu configuration - environment variables, toml file, cli flags, hidden flags. Docker vs binary installation.
- 60 minutes on running a Besu network
- - 15 minutes on Besu in dev mode, curl, easy first steps.
  - 15 minutes on Genesis block generation
  - 30 minutes on consortium creation, with monitoring and health report, with a Docker compose.

Developer session (10AM to Noon Pacific)

- 20 minutes on Besu and Github - source (3 repos), issues, PRs, code checkout, CI.
- 20 minutes on setting up with an IDE. Run and compile with Gradle. Checks and validations in place with spotless and errorprone.
- 20 minutes on the main repository content, describing types of tests in place, showing the tree of dependencies between Gradle modules.
- 30 minutes on adding an opcode to the EVM: show how to add a new opcode, add to the next hard fork revision, how to test it.
- 30 minutes on how to add a new JSON-RPC method, add tests and docs.
