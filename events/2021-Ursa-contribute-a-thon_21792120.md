# Community Events : 2021 Ursa contribute-a-thon

Created by Ry Jones, last modified by David Boswell on Jun 01, 2021

People:

Goals: Build the community of engaged Ursa users

Timing: Campaign in Fall 2021, prep in summer

Plan: Find a set of champions who have used Ursa and get them to write/present/share about why they did it, what their experience was, what benefits they gained, etc.Â  And we can come up with swag to incentivize people who have used and/or contributed to Ursa to connect with the project

Audience: The primary audience is people outside of the group of core Hyperledger maintainers, although we should look at projects/labs in the greenhouse to see where there are opportunities to potentially collaborate with Ursa
