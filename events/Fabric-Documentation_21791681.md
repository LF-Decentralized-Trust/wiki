## Blog and Video Outlines --&gt;

### Blog Title: Hyperledger translators In their own words

### Blog Post Structure

- The international language workgroups
  
  - What are they?
  - Why are they important?
  - What do they do?
- The story of the people
  
  - Start with Chinese team, Rich Zhao with first translation in 2018?
  - Quite for a while 2020... then Aneena, Renato, Tsujita-san
  - Maria, Ourmar, Arseney...
- Short Promo Video (details below)
- Call to action
  
  - How to get involved
  - Video of how to contribute
  - Other projects!

### Promo Video Structure

- Concept is video of translators, each speaking in their own language
  
  - Rich Zhao (China), Aneena (Malayalam), Renato (Brazilian Portuguese), Tsujita-san (Japanese), Maria (Spanish), Oumar (French), Arseney (Russian)...
- Answer a set of standard questions that we can edit together
  
  - What's your name?
  - Who do you work for? (Company, institution or independent)
  - Which country do you come from, and which languages can you speak? (List as many as you would like!)
  - Why is Blockchain important? (1 sentence)
  - Why is translating important, in general? (1 sentence)
  - More specifically, why is it important to translate Hyperledger Fabric into your language (3 or 4 sentences)?
  - How do you collaborate with other people in your language? (5 or 6 sentences)?
  - Which topic did you most enjoy translating, and why? (Topic name, and 2 sentence reason)
  - What does it feel like to see your words in a translated topic?
  - What advice would you give someone who wanted to get started with translating?
  - Say "I'm inviting you to translate"!
- Edit answers into 60 second promo video
  
  - Translate each answer
  - Might be nice to present in multi-lingual form
    
    - Maybe just some, rather than all?
    - Form below is basic concept, but needs to be coherent for each language reader

- Pointers to next steps
  
  - Documentation
  - Sign up at Linux Foundation
  - Workgroup links
  - Rocket Chat
- Guidance for Promo video contributors (thanks to Vladimir Alekseev for these)
  
  - You should answer in your **NATIVE** language
  - Questions follow blitz format so all **answers should be short: 1-2 phrases, 15-20 seconds per question max**.
  - Please **name** the question first, then pause and answer – needed for further convenience in video production
  - **Basic principles for making video:**
    
    - **Light background** (wall) is better
    - **Quiet place** unfortunately is a must – **voice recording is VERY important** here (inside your house/apartment is ok)
    - **Camera** should be on the **eye level** (tripod is the best option, but you don’t have it – you can easily engage your family to make more fun!)
    - Record **upper part of your body**
    - It’s better to choose more **dark colours for clothes** (pure black is not recommended as it’s not convenient in video production; brown, dark blue, green, red or purple is much better)
    - Clothes style does not matter (I do not think that anybody will decide to wear a tie..)
    - Please make **horizontal** recording
    - Please do **Not** put any light at the back, it’s much better to put light on you, as speaker, if possible
    - You can make 10 different recordings (1 recording for question) if it’s more convenient, or 3, or any number - your convenience is more important
    - Smiiiiiiiile :)
  - **Other**
    
    - Your speech will be cut to make mesh between different people and will be duplicated by subtitles, so **please** provide the translation to English.

### Contribution Video Structure
