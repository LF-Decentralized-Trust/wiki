## Project Description *(no more than 1,000 words including graphics)*

1\. Develop altGDP electronic assets based on alternative metrics for collective value. Measure altGDP using an algorithm which learns from scientific discovery the health consequences of environmental perturbation.  
2\. Design a safety net based on alternatives to GDP. The safety net should reward the retired individual for all of her previous data collection, carbon sequestration, environmental conservation, and healthspan extension by issuing retirement benefits according to the environmental credit amassed by the retiree over her lifetime, would issue no retirement benefit to the environmental debtor, and would issue benefits to the lifetime carbon neutral at the standard poverty rate.  
3\. Develop a lifetime environmental impact calculator that includes the environmental impact of an individual's employment and holdings including real estate, investments, and trusts. Make a graphical representation like the one depicted at [http://Green247.org/impact.htm](http://Green247.org/impact.htm) for each employee who uses the calculator.  
4\. Develop a distributed ledger that tracks the lifetime carbon debt incurred by each government official, billionaire, and corporate CEO.  
5\. Develop a smart market that keeps members of the community out of environmental debt. It operates on smart contracts that exchange goods for environmental credit from environmental creditors only. For example, an individual may transfer only her environmental credit or goods. The smart market limits contracts so that each contract preserves her lifetime environmental neutrality.  
6\. Develop a smart contract based on an algorithm which learns from scientific discovery the health consequences of environmental perturbation. The contract limits transfers so that the amount transferred remains within the scientifically estimated value of the impact.  
7\. Track equal opportunities for employees by employer characteristics. Develop a lifetime employer characteristic calculator that includes the characteristics of the employee's past employers to determine the characteristics of the future employers she needs to work for in order to become an equal opportunity employee. Make a graphical representation like the one depicted at [http://Green247.org/employee.htm](http://Green247.org/employee.htm) for each employee who uses the calculator.  
8\. Automate court settlement transfers as the video at [http://green247.org/settlement.mp4](http://green247.org/settlement.mp4) describes.

### Problem

Business as usual leads to trafficking in nature including endangered species.

Too much fear and greed.

Blockchain provides incentive to do the right thing!

### Solution

Greta said that we need system change. Time to Go Green!

This solution provides Green alternatives and incentives.

1\. electronic assets, alternative to gross domestic product, based on scientific estimates alternative metrics for collective value.

2\. electronic assets, alternative to retirement benefits, based on the environmental credit amassed by the retiree over her lifetime.

3\. lifetime environmental impact calculator that includes the environmental impact of an individual's employment and holdings including real estate, investments, and trusts; graphical representation.

4\. lifetime environmental impact calculator for a government official, billionaire, and corporate CEO.

5\. smart contracts that limits transfers to preserve lifetime environmental neutrality.

6\. smart contract that limits transfer amounts based on machine learning from scientific publications on monetary estimates of the costs of human and environmental health.

7\. lifetime employer characteristic calculator and graphical representation.

8\. smart contract that scans court settlement documents and makes transfers to fulfill settlement terms.

### Accomplishment and Team

Elisabeth Green is a Master of Science in biomedical engineering hoping to become a mentee to justify spending time on this project.

### Project Plan

MVP ASAP. Usability testing in one year.

Try everything until it gets done.

Some people might be too greedy to Go Green. If we build the system around them, they may eventually move into it.
