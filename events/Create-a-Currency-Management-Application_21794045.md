Created by David Boswell, last modified on Oct 12, 2023

### **How to Create a Currency Management Application and Deploy it on a Hyperledger Fabric Network**

**Time:**

- Thursday, October 12 at 9 AM Pacific

**Registration:**

- [Register for the workshop](https://zoom.us/meeting/register/tJAucu6tpjstGdWBjYkepXixkFEBP4637-sk)

**Speakers:**

- [Marcus Brandenburger](https://research.ibm.com/people/marcus-brandenburger), Research Staff Member at IBM Research
- [Angelo De Caro](https://www.linkedin.com/in/angelo-de-caro-7954625/), Senior Research Scientist at IBM Research
- [Arne Rutjes](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arnerutjes/), Blockchain Architect at IBM

**Workshop description:**

In this comprehensive guide, we'll walk you through two essential aspects of the Fabric Token-SDK. Firstly, you'll learn how to develop a straightforward token application to manage a currency. You'll grasp the fundamentals of creating tokens, and implementing transaction logic using the Fabric Token-SDK. Once you've mastered the application development, we'll then show you how to effortlessly deploy it in your existing Fabric network, ensuring a seamless integration with your blockchain infrastructure. By the end of this tutorial, you'll be equipped with the skills to expand your blockchain capabilities and unleash the true potential of decentralized currency management.

**Discussion:**

If you have questions about the workshop, join us on the [Hyperledger Discord server](https://chat.hyperledger.org/) in the [#fabric-token-sdk channel](https://discord.com/channels/905194001349627914/945691840110272522).
