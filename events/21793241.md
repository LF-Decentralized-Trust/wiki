### Solution

**a. Describe the solution**

Ans: 

The platform has 2 sides of it

- one for the consumer – through mobile / API frontend. Providing them the ability to check the loyalty points accrued from various travels and providers. And also being able to redeem them
- one for the partners – be it the loyalty program owners like airlines, hotels, etc, or the partners where the points can be redeemed.

This product in blockchain offers decentralized, traceable, immutable, and Transparent solutions. And doing it in the Hyperledger platform provides the enterprise edge to the blockchain solution.

**b. Explain why your solution is better than current state-of-the-art or existing solutions**

Ans: 

Currently, these are the reason the existing solutions are inadequate​

- No open-source trustworthy real-time reconciliation process.​
- No integrated platform that travelers can use to consolidate their travel loyalty points​

**c. Does your solution have any Environmental, Social or Governance impact?**

Ans:

Yes it has Social impact as we are trying to bring together multiple industries and companies on same platform to encourage and give flexibility to user. Which will increase more transactions and help people to engage more in activities.

**d. Did you socialize your project or interact with the community? If yes, what notes did they give? Please tag their LFID username with "@".**

Ans: No

### Project Plan

**a. What does project growth plan look like? What timelines are you looking at?**

Ans:

We are trying to bring more functionalities and make user experience/interface enrich in upcoming months. Detailed plan is as follows for next 2 months:

- Giving  the Leap Point not only on travel booking but also on other purchase to promote travel.​
- Making an expiry date in the wallet balance. Most probably 3 months so that people are persuaded to travel.​
- Giving more points to people using the leap wallet frequently as promotion to incentivize travel

**b. How do you plan to engage open source community?**

Ans:

By making our algorithm open and transparent, and also we want to get more inputs for new features constantly from community to keep our platform Updated. We will make our backend framework available for other Partners to develop user experience on it and increase our LEAP community.

**c. How will the project be sustained? What are the skills that need to maintain and grow the project?**

Ans:

As we will constantly work with open-source community and bring new updates and features regularly, plus no transaction fees for new participants. Which will encourage user to join us and grow our community altogether.

**d. How do you plan for industry option?**

Ans:

As we will gather the data and usage of customer, how much retention does a Loyalty Partner gets, hence will further help them to improve their services to not only retain their customers but also to pull the customers from other services and use Leap coins on their services. It will in the end increase the user experience and companies will try harder.
