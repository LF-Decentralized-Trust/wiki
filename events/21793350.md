### Solution

- We will use DLT to securely store our sensitive credentials.
- To provide a key to trusted clients/service providers granting them access and completing transactions securely
- DLT/Blockchain is a decentralized technology. It is virtually impossible to access and manipulate data in an event of a cyber attack.
- How we could potentially use DLT/Blockchain for data storing:
- Break up data into chunks.
- Encrypt the data so that you are the only one with access to it.
- Distribute files across a network in a way that means all your files are available, even if part of the network is down.

### Project Plan

Main Objective is:

- To revolutionize cloud storage by putting the user back in control over their devices and their data.
- The decentralized aspect of DLT means there are no central servers to be compromised, and because of the use of client-side encryption, only the end users have access to their un-encrypted files and encryption keys.

To do this:

- Research more into DLT and its applications thoroughly
- Develop a platform to store these credentials securely
- Give users control of what they want to store, edit and delete whenever they want with an encryption key
- Provide transparency through the use of DLT
- Market Research
- Finding Investors and Funding to further develop this idea
