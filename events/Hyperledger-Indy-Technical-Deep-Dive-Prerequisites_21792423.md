# Community Events : Hyperledger Indy Technical Deep Dive Prerequisites

Created by Lynn Gray Bendixsen, last modified on Jan 31, 2022

## OS

To successfully follow the examples in the [Hyperledger Indy Technical Deep Dive training](Hyperledger-Indy-Technical-Deep-Dive_21792290.html), you will need an operating system that supports docker. We recommend Ubuntu 18.04 or Mac with at least 30G drive space available (20 is known to fail).

## Required Tools

If not already installed, you will need to install Git and Docker on your system to be able to do the hands-on Labs during the training. Please use the following steps in your command line tool:

**git**

- Ubuntu 18.04
  
  ```
  sudo apt install -y git
  ```
- Mac
  
  ```
  git --version
  ```
  
  If Git is not installed, it will prompt you to install it.

**Docker**

- Only perform steps 1 and 2 from the following link to install docker on Ubuntu: [https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-on-ubuntu-18-04](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-on-ubuntu-18-04).
- The following can be used as a guide to installing docker on Mac: [https://docs.docker.com/desktop/mac/install/](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/mac/install/)

## Fork the indy-node Git repo:

- Create a github account for yourself if you do not already have one. Go [here](https://www.wikihow.com/Create-an-Account-on-GitHub) if you need help.
- Go to [https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node)
- Click "fork" (upper right) and select your personal github account from the list.
- From your fork click the green Code button.
- Click 'HTTPS" and Copy the URL link shown in the field. Use this link in the next step.

## Clone and build from your fork of indy-node:

Copy and paste the following commands into a terminal command prompt:

```
mkdir gitdir
cd gitdir
git clone <paste the path from the previous step> -b ubuntu-20.04-upgrade
cd indy-node 
docker build -t indy-node-dev -f .devcontainer/Dockerfile .devcontainer/ 
docker run --rm -it -v $(pwd):/node:z indy-node-dev
cd /node
pip install .[tests]
cd indy_common 
pytest . 
cd ../indy_node
pytest . 

```

The last few steps (pytest .) might take a long time to run (more than 20 minutes). A few individual test errors are expected at this time, but not more than 10.  If you get a larger number of failures, try increasing the available drive space. A VM with only 20G of drive space is known to not be enoough for several of the tests.

## NOTE: Ubuntu in a VM:

If Ubuntu is installed in a VirtualBox VM do the following:

- Perform all the steps listed in [this tutorial](https://www.tecmint.com/install-virtualbox-guest-additions-in-ubuntu/) to update your system and enable copy and paste.
- Make sure to restart your VM and that the Shared Clipboard is set to bidirectional:
- - In your VM machine settings, in Virtual Box &gt; General &gt; Advanced
  - set ‘Shared Clipboard’ to ‘Bidirectional’
