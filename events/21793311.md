### Solution

#### a. Describe the solution

Use social Identity provider such as Google, Meta, LinkedIn to login on our AnoSoLog platform. In our AnoSoLog platform the user can issue his credentials of the social login provider as verifable credential to his wallet on his mobile phone. The user can use the AnoSoLog credentials to login on third party services such as linux foundation, or stack overflow using the verifiable credential and without using a password.  
The original data from social identity provider are transfered without notify them, this means the identity provider cannot collect and track the behavior of the user. The user can analyse his behavior in his wallet, and see which data the user transfered to whom.  
The thirdparty services can easy integrate the AnoSoLog verifier using tutorials and packages provided by Linux Foundation on their own, or get support of the AnoSoLog team or integrate the AnoSoLog SaaS

#### b. Explain why your solution is better than current state-of-the-art or existing solutions

The IDP cannot track any user behavior.  
Users can immediately see in the AnoSoLog wallet where they have logged in with all of their accounts, which usage right they accepted and they can revoke granted rights of use.  
Real User needs are in focus instead of monetization of user behavior.

#### c. Does your solution have any Environmental, Social or Governance impact?

Web3 is a trend, people are aware of data protection. Plus data protection laws are strict. New eID of european union and Switzerland will be based on SSI.

#### d. Did you socialise your project or interact with the community? If yes, what notes did they give? Please tag their LFID username with "@".

We socialized with experts as well as «normal users» as part of our research and learning process. The results are the major 3 success factors we identified and which are the foundation of our solution.

### Project Plan

#### a. What does project growth plan look like? What timelines are you looking at?

Plan &amp; Timeline: PROTOTYPE (till May 2022) LAUNCH (till July 2022) SCALE UP till April 2023. Details:

#### b. How do you plan to engage open source community?

We intend to **invite** the community to work on the project together with us. They will be **included** in the process of our roadmap through tasks and documentations. We also **encourage** contributors to share their experience with AnoSolog with others and also intend to **celebrate** the collective work together.

#### c. How will the project be sustained? What are the skills that need to maintain and grow the project?

Program manager  to coordinate the activities

Coaches for tutorials and lectures

Developers and Architects for AnoSoLog Issuer platform

Developers and Architects for Integration of AnoSoLog

Business Developer and Marketing to spread the Idea

#### d. How do you plan for industry option?

Bringing Value for the customers, we offer a free to use AnoSoLog Issuer. Based on our research, people will support our solution. Then we offer an open source verifier AnoSoLog to integrate in industry web services. This can be integrated for free using tutorials and lectures, supported by us or as Service solution. We expect natural growth, based on adoption by customers.
