# Community Events : Maintainer Days October 21-22, 2024

Created by David Boswell, last modified on Oct 28, 2024

- **When and Where:** Monday, Oct 21 and Tuesday, Oct 22, 2024 in San Francisco in the [Salesforce Tower](https://salesforcetower.com/), in the Accenture San Francisco Innovation Hub on the 33rd Floor, 415 Mission Street, Suite 3300
  
- **Who:** Anyone can attend as long as you are a maintainer of a Hyperledger project or lab. If you'd like to attend but aren't a maintainer yet, there is still time to get involved with an existing project or lab or to start your own project or lab and become a maintainer before the event. [If you'd like help with the process for how to become a maintainer, reach out and we're happy to help](mailto:community-architects@hyperledger.org).
- **How:** Details about how to sign up will be shared soon.
  
  - Note that we will contact maintainers about how to register, so make sure you are included in your project's or lab's MAINTAINERS.md file. If there are MAINTAINERS.md files that are incomplete or out of date you may not be included in our list of maintainers.

**Resources:**

- Slides from some of the presentations are linked to below and there are also some [photos available of the group exercises and collaboration sessions](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1phg4kvKl48OBpN0r-2qd7IcfKzJIahMv?usp=drive_link).  Feel free to link to anything from the event in this wiki page or add content to the Google Drive at the link above.

Note that when you register, you'll also be registered for Hyperledger's Member Summit that is happening in San Francisco on October 23-24.  All Maintainers are invited to attend that event as well to have a chance to connect with people from Hyperledger's member companies.

#### Making the case internally for attending the Maintainer Days

We understand that getting approval for travel is a process many people need to work on with their employers and we want to help you with those discussions. Here is some information that could be useful for you – if there is any additional information you could use, [please let us know](mailto:community-architects@lfdecentralizedtrust.org).

- For people who haven't attended in person Hyperledger maintainer events in the past, these events have been very productive and generative for the attendees. For reference, you can see details of the last in person [Maintainer event in 2019](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/events/Maintainer+Summit+October+8-10%2C+2019) and [earlier Hackfests](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/events/Hackfests) (the original name for Maintainer events) on the wiki.
- The Maintainer Days will be a great chance to network with people from other organizations.  If you choose to also attend the Hyperledger Member Summit later that week you'll have a chance to meet with even more people from the [member organizations in the Hyperledger community](https://www.hyperledger.org/members).
- We've organized this event to coincide with other events in the area you may also want to attend:
  
  - Event in area before: 
    
    - [ETHGlobal San Francisco](https://ethglobal.com/events/sanfrancisco2024) on Oct 18-20
