## Project Description *(no more than 1,000 words including graphics)*

FabDesigner project aims to create a graphical user interface that helps FH administrators to graphically design, configure and update a fabric network for production. The GUI tool will help administrators to generate the needed scripts and to bootstrap a fabric network without requiring a good knowledge of HF mechanics.

The GUI will provide a web based network visualizer similar to the following (although the picture represents a non HF network)

From this user interface the user can design, configure and deploy a HF network.

### Problem

a. The problem we target is how to reduce the current complexity of setting up and managing a Hyperledger fabric network

b. Most solutions are intended to provide a simulation environment and not to help administrators build up a production-ready network 

### Solution

a. FabDesigner project will provide administrators with a drag and drop tool that helps them to design and configure a HF network. The tool will help the users to transform this design into scripts that will bootstrap the network. Moreover, this tool will help administrators from different organizations to perform their actions and interact with the deployed network without writing a single command.

b. FabDesigner is better than the existing one since it proposes the idea of graphically building and configuring a HF network (test network or a production network), unlike most solutions that focus only on building local simulators.

c. For the MVP we intend to build a GUI that enables to graphically design and configure a production-ready HF network. 

### Accomplishment and Team

a. We already contribute to Hyperledger fabric(HF) and we have an experienced team with more than 8 years in the blockchain industry. We have been using HF since its first version and we have a good grasp of its inner mechanics. We have deployed HF in dozens of projects running in production and based on this experience we feel that there is a need for such a tool like FabDesigner.

b. We need support to develop the business model and technical support

### Project Plan

a. The first prototype would be a proof of concept that demonstrates the core concept of graphically building an HF network. The prototype will evolve as a set of monthly releases including new features. In the span of a year, we plan to have a major release that enables administrators to design networks, perform basic operations such as adding new organizations or upgrading chaincodes.

b. Our plan :

- Exploration phase;
- Setting up an architecture for the FabDesigner;
- Building the Core module.
- Building GUI composer.
- Shipping first version.

c. FabDesign could be impacted by the upgrade of HF and the lack of backward compatibility. To mitigate such risk we intend to build a modular system that makes upgrading easy and support multiple Fabric versions possible.
