Here's some info on existing Calendar Plugin Apps for Confluence

There are multiple calendar plugins available in the Confluence marketplace.

There are a few good candidates, one of which is lower cost than the others

There also is an option conceptually to embed an iFrame control in Confluence that calls a standard Google Calendar

### **Google Calendar Page Macro**

This app is billable starting about $.25 per month per registered user

### Some calendars found in the Manage Apps Confluence Marketplace

The **Google Calendar plugin is free but only works for the server version** - not the cloud version

The Google Calendar plugin for the server version is referenced here:

### Google Team Calendars ( from Atlassian )

[https://skywebteam.atlassian.net/wiki/plugins/servlet/ac/com.atlassian.confluence.emcee/discover#!/discover/app/com.atlassian.confluence.extra.team-calendars](https://skywebteam.atlassian.net/wiki/plugins/servlet/ac/com.atlassian.confluence.emcee/discover#!/discover/app/com.atlassian.confluence.extra.team-calendars)

This plugin is from Atlassian

While it is expensive ( about $30 per year per registered user ), there may be discounts for a non-profit organization.

#### This plugin has some constraints as well for Jira

Team Calendars for Confluence provides one place for fast-moving teams working in Confluence to stay in sync – so they know who’s doing what and when. Teams can stay organized and communicate availability with a schedule of personal and team events linked to their personal calendars and Confluence pages. Sync Team Calendars for Confluence with Outlook, Google Calendar (Android) and Apple Calendar.

Visit the [Atlassian website](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence/team-calendars) to learn more.

Plugin Dependency - To enable the Jira Software integration features for Team Calendars for Confluence you must install the [Team Calendars for Confluence for Jira Integration Plugin](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugin/details/72413) in Jira. This plugin is bundled in Jira 4.4.x and or later.

After installing the app on a page, it shows either a 7 day or a 30 day list of events

If I select any event in the list, it opens a new window showing the standard Google Calendar with all the options I normally have.

Here, I can add subscriptions to other calendars, import calendar events etc - everything we normally do in Google Calendar

Overall not a bad solution and reasonably affordable compared to other Google Calendar plugins

Let me know your thoughts if you have tried any of these in the comments - thanks ..
