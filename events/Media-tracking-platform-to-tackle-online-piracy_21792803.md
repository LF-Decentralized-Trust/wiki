## Project Description *(no more than 1,000 words including graphics)*

Copyright infringement is a big issue in today's world, where intellectual property is often worth more than a physical one. When a piracy website distributes media that is copyrighted by some other entity, it makes the entity lose money and as a result even governments lose their share of taxes. And since such infringement leads to less purchases of the copyrighted content through legal means, it also lowers the income in industries that produce such content.

Since encryptions and device restrictions are often not enough to limit piracy, another way to limit it would be targeting the websites that distribute copyright content illegally. Our system is a distributed database of information of copyright content provided by the legal owner of such content that can be accessed by our crawler as a sample to identify content similar to it on unauthorised websites. The crawler indexes the URL and IP address of the platform hosting the content illegally and notifies the concerned owner of the content. Who verify whether the content belongs to them. If it is verified that the content does belong to them, the illegal distributor or the content is taken down from the internet.  

### Problem

Copyright infringement is a big issue in today's world, where intellectual property is often worth more than a physical one. When a piracy website distributes media that is copyrighted by some other entity, it makes the entity lose money and as a result even governments lose their share of taxes. And since such infringement leads to less purchases of the copyrighted content through legal means, it also lowers the income in industries that produce such content.

Encryptions like DRM and device restrictions are often not enough to limit piracy. The number of content that actually gets leaked is not small. It includes theatre recordings, content got by circumventing DRM on DVDs and Blu-rays, streaming recordings and leaks of original copies as well. Since the leak of such content is inevitable, might as well focus on removing it from illegal platforms as soon as possible.

### Solution

Our solution is a combination of web crawlers, deep web crawlers and a distributed database system on blockchain setup using Hyperledger Fabric. The database contributors are mainly the owners of the copyright content. They can contribute a database node to our blockchain if they need to and can remove it from the blockchain as well, according to their necessity.

The crawler searches the internet for any content or link that appears similar to the content whose information has been provided on the blockchain, indexes it and our system sends out a notification to the copyright content owner, who then verifies it and approves forwarding of the crawled information to law enforcement or any other agency responsible for taking the content down.

Existing solutions utilise crawlers just like our system. The key difference between their system and ours is that they don't involve anyone else in the process, other than the copyright owner. In our case, the content owner can be a part of the blockchain system and contribute towards it. Law enforcement agencies and other agencies that can contribute by facilitating removal of the content can also be part of our blockchain system.

Another difference is that the existing service providers crawl the web only for a particular content that they have been tasked to find on contract basis. Our system lets the stakeholders manage their own database of content that they don't want to be infringed.

During the prototype phase, a web crawler and a basic distributed blockchain database can be setup with the facility to search for content that the crawler has found and suspects of being infringed.
