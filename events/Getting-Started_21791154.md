# Community Events : Getting Started

Created by Silona Bonewald, last modified on Apr 30, 2019

# So you wanna go to a bootcamp?

First -make sure you have a Linux Foundation ID and that you can edit this wiki!

Second - do a little research and see what sessions are available.  Under the Sessions link for the particular Bootcamp you are interested in attending.

Third - If you don't see what you like - propose something and if you don't feel like you can lead it - Ask for help!  Go ahead and create a page!  The sooner the better for Session leaders to help you find someone!

This is a Do-cracy.  So for example,  if you are frustrated that certain materials don't help you get on-boarded ask to do an On-boarding editing session.  We will ask that someone is there to help with the on-boarding process while you help them FIX their documentation.  Everyone wins!
