482.solutions (see details in section “Accomplishment and Team”)  develops product Electrodo - software service for climate-related assets and risk management to increase enterprise market value. Electrodo solves the problem of data reliability and trust for carbon-related assets and climate-related risk management and disclosures through using a standardized framework based on TCFD Recommendations and data verification on blockchain.

Using Electrodo companies can track and trace carbon-related assets, set climate-related impact targets and follow-up on their progress, where those targets and progress measures may also be accessed by environmental agencies, investors, lenders, insurance underwriters to improve capital-allocation decisions (Fig. 1). As result enterprises get financially material outcomes and measurable motivation for sustainable transformation by: getting access to green financing mechanisms (e.g. green investments, green bonds, green loans etc.), reducing cost of money (e.g. bank crediting rate); avoiding carbon taxes (e.g. CBAM in EU); avoiding loss of stakeholders (e.g. investors, customers, suppliers) and increasing enterprise market value.

Fig. 1 - Electrodo in nutshell

During the project, we plan to develop a prototype (Fig. 2) that implements the basic functionality for the climate-related disclosure service (collection and verification of data, publication of reports).

### Problem

#### a. Describe the problem

In the post-industrial world we need to rethink and rebuild financial system from a profit-oriented to sustainability-oriented approach. Today companies don’t understand what are climate-related risks and how climate-related risks impact on assets value and financial outcomes. By implementing TCFD Recommendations Electrodo helps companies and investors identify, assess and manage carbon-related assets and climate-related risks across enterprise value and investment chains and transform climate-related risks into opportunities and financial outcomes.

#### b. Explain why existing solutions are inadequate

Existing solutions focus only on the climate-related data management and don’t solve the cornestone problem of creating and managing sustainable (shared) value.

#### c. Describe the competitive landscape

Now, industrial digital infrastracture has turned its attention to the world of social and environmental impact. The era of Impact-as-a-Service™ has arrived. 

Our main competitors: [EcoVadis](https://ecovadis.com/), [Persefoni](https://persefoni.com/), [GumboNet ESG](https://www.datagumbo.com/gumbonet-esg). Solutions from other vendors: [SAP Climate 21](https://www.sap.com/documents/2020/06/ec443a74-9d7d-0010-87a3-c30de2ffd8ff.html), [Ecochain](https://ecochain.com/), [Datamaran](https://www.datamaran.com/), [Sustainaccount](https://sustainaccount.com/climate_risks/?lang=en), [Mercatus](https://www.gomercatus.com/).

### Solution

#### a. Describe the solution

At baseline Electrodo uses a Life Cycle Assessment technique and TCFD Framework (TCFD Recomendations) focused on end-to-end enterprise climate-related assets and resources traceability. Electrodo includes two blockchain-enabled components: Token Management Engine - for asset’s data and context notarization (anchoring to blockchain through hashing) and Asset Management Engine for verification of climate-related disclosure. These blockchain Electrodo’s components developed on the top of Hyperledger Fabric v2.x - open-source enterprise-grade blockchain framework.

#### b. Explain why your solution is better than current state-of-the-art or existing solutions

Our unique value proposition is that we are building solution that focuses on solving the fundamental financial problem of managing enterprise value (market capitalization), conditioned initially by climate-related factors. Our goal is not just to measure factors of market value, but to set a functional, manageable correlation between factors (e.g. climate-related risks) and enterprise market value (market capitalization).

#### b. Identify talent/resource gaps and needs (Do you need more support developing the blockchain solution? Do you need support with front end development? Do you need support developing the business model?)

We just need technical mentorship from the Hyperledger Fabric team on the right use of components for tokenization. We also need a review (e.g. from Hyperledger Challenge Ambassador [Sherwood Moore](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/events/Challenge+Ambassadors), Co-chair, Climate Action and Accounting SIG) of our concept, in terms of best practices for developing solutions for managing climate-related risks of industrial enterprises.
