## Project Description *(no more than 1,000 words including graphics)*

There is an intention in human beings for helping for the non-for-profit purposes. As a result, lots of money goes for the projects, which are somewhat similar to each other, and lots of money cost for operating the NGOs. Moreover, in Islamic nations, there are some rules, which comprise of sharia that guide Muslims for respecting to these issues. We have made a survey to responds to these issues and identified its main reason: non-disclosure recording of poor people and their requirements. Therefore, we have designed a distributed ecosystem (so called Sunyar, which means distributed platform for managing charities in Persian) by a block chain platform (HyperLedger Fabric).

Sunyar is a distributed settlement platform, which can be used by charities for managing donation process. This can be done by an open-source platform, which can linked to a distributed ledger for charities. The open-source platform helps them for automating their process and the distributed ledger can used for two main reasons: uniqueness of needy and their requirements, and transparent aid for them.

### Problem

- Unique identification of needy people and their requirements is a critical issue for uprising the productivity of helping people (parallel aid is a common issue in lots of countries)
- Fair distribution of aids (money or commodities) is another critical issue when there is not a management tools for distribution and a transparent system of records. This can made economic problems like making fake jobs (people which pretend to be a needy one), lowering overall productivity and etc.
- Process of helping the others in a traditional method is a time and money consuming process. As a result, NGOs required a standard platform with respect to their rules (Islamic ones for our case) and the ecosystem.
- Trust in real charities and transparency for real process of helping the others, is another critical issue for charities.

### Solution

- Developing an open-source platform for charities for automating their process.
- Design and develop a distributed platform for registering unique needy people and recording transparent and trackable transaction (for making fair distribution of aid and uprising thrust of people to charities, which are in Sunyar ecosystem).
- Develop a tokenization process for making commodities into digital assets for tracking them in the process.

The proposed model aims to build a consensus between non-governmental organizations (charities) in the first phase based on five main processes that consists of:

- Registration of needy
- Recording of benevolent projects
- Recording of aid to the needy of any charity that are in Sunyar network
- Recording state of aid between charities (collecting money or commodities from donors and distributing them to needy ones)
- Distributed settlement between charities

To develop this distributed ecosystem, there are three consensus which are:

1. a consensus between benevolent projects
2. a consensus between NGOs (charities) and benevolent projects
3. and also, a consensus between charities for settlement

The technical architecture shown in below figure, has three parts that consist of:

- The client section is the web-side customer service that interacts with end users.
- The middleware section includes communication APIs and SDKs that will provide communication between the client section and the kernel section.
- The kernel part of the infrastructure is based on Hyperledger Fabric infrastructure. It has been formed from NGOs (charities) as organizations and each NGOs (charities) have endorser and committer nodes. A consensus chosen is RAFT for distributed network.

### Accomplishment and Team

Behsazan Farda is one of the main actors in Iranian fintech industry. In 2019, they started Polwinno (it means the Innovation Bridge) as one of its main subsidiaries, which is active in new business lines and technologies. Polwinno has focused on corporate banking and the application of technologies in this field in business and distributed ledger technologies in its technology lines.

Polwinno is co funder and investor of Kuknos (in the field of issuing contingent convertible bonds and asset tokenization), Sumyar (Distributed platform for trade finance and supply chain finance) and Emta (an ID as a service platform, which can serve its client in a distributed environment). As a result, settlement is one of our main issues in applied use cases in distributed ecosystem.

Distributed settlement required a real and practical case study and as results, we have selected distributed settlement in the charity world. Moreover, in charity, there are many issues, which the solution must solved them (problem section) and the Sunyar Project started for them with respect to distributed settlement as our social responsibility.

- **Seyed Behnam Khakbaz** is a business analyst in the field of distributed systems. He is the business architect of first enterprise level blockchain project (called Kuknos) and the designer of first distributed B2B trade finance platform (Sumyar) in Iran. He is the consultant of this project and director of business in Polwinno.
- **Sanaz Vahidi** is a system analyst in the field of distributed systems. She is the system architect of enterprise blockchain and application projects. She has twenty years experiences in product development. She is the blockchain product manager of this project.

He has experiences in these fields (Databases: SQL server, MongoDB, CouchDB; Java Script (Client-side): Ajax, DOM, mask, jQuery; Java Script (Server-side): NodeJS, ExpressJS; Microservice, Restful API, ...). He is the blockchain developer of this project.
- **Morteza Mahdavi** is a full stack developer in enterprise application. He has experiences in these fields (Html5 &amp; Css3 &amp; Sass &amp; Bootstrap5, JavaScript, ReactJs, VueJs, NodeJS, Restful API, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, PWA, NextJs, …). He is a full stack developer of this project.
- **Iman Aghamohammadi** is a DevOps engineer in the field of distributed systems. He is the DevOps engineer of first enterprise level blockchain project (called Kuknos). He has experiences in these fields (Docker, Lpic 1&amp;2, Prometheus / Grafana, Zabbix, Elastic search, Kubernetes, VMware, Bash and Gitlab Ci). He is a DevOps engineer of this project.
