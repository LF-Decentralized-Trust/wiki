## **What:**

Aries will host an Interop event on August 31, 2022. 7:00am-11:00am MDT

## **Goal:**

This interactive event will comprise teams across the verifiable credentials community testing products and solutions both in the market and in development for interoperability. The goal is to discover what needs to be done to ensure that all are interoperable with Aries and with one another. Participants will come away with an understanding of where the gaps are in interoperability and hopefully how they can be fixed. This event is about discovery, discussion, and most importantly – interoperability! Observers are also welcome to attend!

### **Helpful details for Participants:**

All participants must be able to make a connection between agents using DIDComm connection V1 or Out of Band. 

Any Participant is welcome to bring agents that support DIDComm and may test any of the following:

- Targets:
- - 557 Discover Features
  - 048 Trust Ping
  - 434 OOB
  - 023 DID Exchange
  - OOB Reuse
- Bonus Targets:
- - 455 Issue
  - 454 Present
  - 183 Revocation Notification

### **Final Report**

**Successes**

- **AFJ - OOB 1.1, ACAPy OOB 1.0. ACAPy not yet fully supporting minor versions for this protocol.**
  
  - **Expand testing of minor version handling**
  - **Expansion RFC 003 - Clarifying how minor version handling**
- **AFJ Hotfix to enable connection reuse with ACAPy**
- **Aries Agent Test Harness**
  
  - **Expanding AFJ Backchannel so it covers more defined tests.**
  - **Mobile backchannel - only supports some test cases, mostly AIP 1**
  - **Currently impossible to test using the Mobile backchannel with any other impl than ACAPy, other should be added.**
  - **Custom credentials in the AATH (discussed in breakout 4, was recorded)**

**Lessons Learned**

- **James Schulte conversation about Ontologies with credentials - will schedule an Aries WG agenda item on the topic.**
- **Migrate mobile app - expansion of credentials use cases**
- **ACAPy - old format of DIDs w/did-exchange - startup param controls which are used.**
  
- **Nice to see new wallets - Upa! (Gary de Beer), Migrate (Jimmy Dorsey)**

**Notes for future events (operational suggestions)**

- **Being specific about networks to be used during testing.**
- **Breakout rooms worked well**
- **Wanted to attend all the education sessions.**
- **Testing script for UX testing**
- **Set of targets? Basics hit, next interopathon may be a similar set, but with higher success and coverage.**
