# Community Events : Pitch Deck Template

Created by Arun .S.M., last modified by Deepika P Karanji on May 09, 2022

Please use this template for the pitch deck.

The "Demo" slide contained within the pitch deck is going to be ONLY a demo of the working application/ prototype, and NOT the pitch itself.

You will be uploading only the pitch deck slides as a part of the submission, and NOT a video of pitch explanation.Â 

We also request you to upload the demo video again separately, independent of the pitch deck in the Submissions page.
