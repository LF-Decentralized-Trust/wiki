Created by David Boswell, last modified on Nov 29, 2022

### **Using Hyperledger Besu to Participate in Public Ethereum Networks for Staking, Data, and Development**

**Time:**

- Wednesday, October 5, 2022 from 8 AM to 10 AM Pacific / 11 AM to 1 PM Eastern

**Slides and Recording:**

**Workshop description:**

Matt Nelson, a Product Manager at ConsenSys, leads this technical workshop about how to operate the Hyperledger Besu Ethereum client on public networks and test nets and discusses staking and development using public infrastructure.

This workshop aims to outline the benefits and discuss the risks and nuances of participating in Ethereum public networks with Hyperledger Besu. Network participation can be very rewarding! Attend to learn about setting up Besu in an environment that can connect to other nodes correctly; how to think about staking Ether for rewards (and helping decentralize + secure Ethereum); and considerations and what to know when developing, testing, and deploying dapps on public networks.

The goal of this workshop is to come away feeling confident in the benefits and risks of using public infrastructure and to understand more about the future of Ethereum and Besu.

We will walk through using the Goerli test net to demonstrate live all of the above. 

**Preparation:**

- Install docker, curl, Java 17 and Git
  
- [Download repos](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu)
- Sign up for access to the Hyperledger Besu [#besu-workshop Discord channel](https://discord.com/channels/905194001349627914/974732102450970654).
  
  - This channel will be used for tech support before and during the scheduled training.  If you have questions about joining our Discord server, [check out our guide for using Discord](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/HYP/Our+chat+service).
- Check out these configurations for [Besu](https://gist.github.com/non-fungible-nelson/9aa7e6626f93a588e8f75f8f846ced3e) and [Teku](https://gist.github.com/non-fungible-nelson/c12e653a8fc52fb8a88e33df620e6ac7) if you are eager to sync Goerli in advance to follow along!
- Check out the [Ethereum launchpad for Goerli](https://goerli.launchpad.ethereum.org/) if you are looking to test out a full validating node and staking ETH!
