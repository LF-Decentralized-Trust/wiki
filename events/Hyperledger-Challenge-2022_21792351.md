## Challenge Overview

The Hyperledger community is launching the Hyperledger Challenge to harness the power of communities to ideate, develop, and launch innovative solutions developed using open-source technologies. Any innovation that advances the current state-of-the-art of enterprise-grade distributed ledger technologies leveraging one or more [Hyperledger projects](https://start-here.hyperledger.org/projects.html) is eligible for the Hyperledger Challenge. 

The Challenge will feature three rounds, called “**Ideate**”, “**Prototype**”, and “**Launch**”, to develop innovations from idea to sustainable solutions in the manner of months. Innovators competing in the challenges will have access to training, mentors  and the Hyperledger community to support the development of their solution.  The Hyperledger community is committed to be a driving force to incorporating Diversity, Civility, and Inclusion into programs. Innovators are greatly encouraged to consider diversity and inclusion when developing their teams.

The [Hyperledger Foundation](https://www.hyperledger.org/) hosts a number of enterprise-grade blockchain software projects. The projects are conceived and built by the [developer community](https://start-here.hyperledger.org/community.html) for vendors, end user organizations, service providers, start-ups, academics and others to use to build and deploy blockchain networks or commercial solutions. This challenge will feature:

- A network of support for future innovators to advance the current state-of-the art of enterprise-grade distributed ledger technologies. Reach out to Hyperledger [Challenge Ambassadors](Challenge-Ambassadors_21792409.html) for more information on the resources that are available in the Hyperledger community.
- A place to partner with similar entrepreneurs, to connect with leading experts, to learn, to scale up, and to achieve real impact in the world.

The Hyperledger Foundation is committed to creating a safe and welcoming community for all. Therefore, all innovators of the Hyperledger Challenge are requested to visit the Hyperledger [Code of Conduct](https://start-here.hyperledger.org/code-of-conduct.html) and [Antitrust Policy Notice](https://start-here.hyperledger.org/antitrust.html).

## Challenge Information: Ideate, Prototype, and Launch

### Ideate Challenge

***Innovators IDENTIFY a concept*** that advances the current state-of-the-art of enterprise-grade distributed ledger technologies leveraging one or more Hyperledger projects. The proposed concept must clearly articulate a solution-market fit where the solution fulfills a market need. More information on the Ideate Challenge is [here](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/events/Ideate+Challenge).

#### Ideate Prizes

1. Participants in the ideate challenge will be given feedback on their submission, access to training courses, and matched with mentor(s) based on the identified need to support the development of their prototype solution.
2. Winners of the ideate challenge will have their project featured as a [Hyperledger Labs](https://labs.hyperledger.org) to encourage the community-wide engagement and development of the prototype solution.

### Prototype Challenge

***Innovators DEVELOP a prototype*** of their proposed solution that sufficiently proves the critical functionality. The prototype must sufficiently demonstrate that the solution will fulfill a market need that sustains its follow-on development. More information on the Prototype Challenge is [here](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/events/Prototype+Challenge).

#### Prototype Prizes

1. Winners of the prototype challenge will have their project featured as a [Linux Foundation Crowdfunding](https://lfx.linuxfoundation.org/tools/crowdfunding/) project for follow-on collaborative development.
2. Winners will also be provided marketing support including the opportunity to demonstrate their solution to the Technical Steering Committee, Working Groups, Special Interest Groups, and promotion across Hyperledger channels.

### Launch Challenge

***Innovators COLLABORATE to build*** an ecosystem around their software solutions. Innovators will be evaluated based on the impact of their solution for successful commercial adoption. More information on the Launch Challenge is [here](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/events/Launch+Challenge).

#### Launch Prizes

1. Winners of the Launch challenge will receive a travel scholarship to attend Hyperledger Global Forum 2022. This will be an unique opportunity to demonstrate your solution before a global community.
2. Runner-ups will receive Hyperledger Certification voucher(s).
