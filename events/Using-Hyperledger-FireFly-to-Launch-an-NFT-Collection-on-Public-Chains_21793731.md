Created by David Boswell, last modified on Mar 23, 2023

### **Using Hyperledger FireFly to Launch an NFT Collection on Public Chains**

**Time:**

- Thursday, March 23, 2023 from 8 AM to 11 AM Pacific / 11 AM to 2 PM Eastern

**Recording:**

**Workshop description:**

In this workshop, Nicko Guyer, Alex Shorsher and David Echelberger, Full Stack Engineers at [Kaleido](https://www.kaleido.io/) and [Hyperledger FireFly](https://www.hyperledger.org/use/firefly) maintainers and contributors, will show you how to use Hyperledger FireFly to launch an NFT collection on public chains.

We’ll provide an overview of Hyperledger FireFly features including:

- Web3 Gateway Mode - for connecting to popular public chains like Ethereum, Polygon, Avalanche, Optimism, Arbitrum, etc.
- Public Blockchain Tools - with support for managing and signing transactions
- Enterprise-friendly functionality - to ensure new apps meet both user and compliance requirements.
- Integration capabilities - for connecting your NFT app to existing enterprise systems.

From there, we’ll take you through the steps to create and launch an NFT collection on Polygon using Hyperledger FireFly. With live coding and easy-to-follow steps, you’ll have everything you need to launch your own NFT collection.

This session is targeted to developers of intermediate skill level and above, with some prior amount of blockchain knowledge. New developers, or those without any prior blockchain knowledge may still find it informative, as Hyperledger FireFly is very approachable. At the same time, it is also flexible and customizable to meet the needs of experienced blockchain developers.

**Resources:**

- [Workshop guide](https://github.com/nguyer/firefly-nft-workshop-2023-03-023)
