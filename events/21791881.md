**Meeting Details**

- **Day:** October 6 (the first Tuesday of each month)
- **Time:** 16:00 UTC / 9 AM pacific (feel free to suggest alternate times)
- **Dial-in:** [https://zoom.us/j/4336690939](https://zoom.us/j/4336690939)

**Agenda**

- Introductions
- Zoom changes
  
  - Zoom now requires that all meetings have a passcode. People without passcodes will be placed in a waiting room.
  - Note that meeting hosts can’t claim host while in meeting room, so hosts need to have the password to start a meeting.  Attendees without a passcode will need to be let into the meeting from the waiting room by host.  The host key hasn’t changed, so you can still claim host the same way once you’re in the meeting.
  - You should see a pwd= in the URL, like this: [https://zoom.us/my/hyperledger.community?pwd=STZQd0xMZU9xRVVOVnpQM3JNQ2dqZz09](https://zoom.us/my/hyperledger.community?pwd=STZQd0xMZU9xRVVOVnpQM3JNQ2dqZz09)
  - As part of these changes, we’ve also made changes to letting people dial-in over the phone (note that this applies to audio phone calls and not using the mobile version of Zoom on phones).  If you have many members dialing in to calls with their phone, let us know so we can adjust this setting as needed.
- Demo from Shabs
- Lessons learned in the past month
  
  - What have you seen that has worked well or that could be improved?  Are there things you think we should be trying, such as break-out rooms?
- Other topics?
  
  - Feel free to add other topics to the agenda
  - How to keep your local community engaged
  - Recruiting speakers and selecting engaging topics. (Suggest discussing collaboration with Hyperledger Ambassadors or Hyperledger Speakers Bureau).
  - Do we want to discuss a series, like Meetup organizers rotating the hosting a member of the TSC each week.
  - We may also want to look at other innovative short presentation formats like [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PechaKucha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PechaKucha) to add to an exiting Meetup that may not run for a full hour.
