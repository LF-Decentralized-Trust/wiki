Created by David Huseby on Jun 07, 2019

This section of the Bootcamp space is dedicated to collecting all of the content (e.g. slide decks, presentation notes, etc) that was created to support past bootcamps so that future bootcamps have a place to start.

### Todo:

- Email the session leaders listed in the [sessions](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/BOOTHK/Sessions) and ask them to add their decks and notes
