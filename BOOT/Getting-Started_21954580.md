# Bootcamps (archived) : Getting Started

# So you wanna go to a bootcamp?

### First -

Make sure you have a Linux Foundation ID and that you can edit this wiki!

### Second -

Do a little research and see what sessions are available.  Look under the Sessions link for the bootcamp you are attending!

### Third -

If you don't see what you like - propose something and if you don't feel like you can lead it - Ask for help!  Go ahead submit a proposal!  Add it to the GRID! Let us know if you can't lead it so we can help find someone!

*This is a Do-cracy.  So for example,  if you are frustrated that certain materials don't help you get on-boarded ask to do an On-boarding editing session.  We will ask that someone is there to help with the on-boarding process while you help them FIX their documentation.  Everyone wins!*
