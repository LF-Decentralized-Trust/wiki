# Hyperledger Mentorship Program : Project Plan - Secure DID Registry on Github/Gitlab for Hyperledger Frameworks

Created by Arun Prakash, last modified on Nov 20, 2020

**Goals :**

To develop a command-line utility, that can be used to create a DID registry structure, thus onboarding the trusted team with necessary ACL set for working with the git repository. This should be enabled with an API layer to facilitate the interaction with DID registry and the possibility of integration with other platforms.

**Timeline:**

**This is the initial level RoadMap and it is subjected to change depending upon the progress of work and any design changes introduced during the course of work.**
