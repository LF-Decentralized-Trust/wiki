# Hyperledger Mentorship Program : Project Plan - Hyperledger Labs AI-FAQ: GUI implementation and prototype deployment

Created by Jacqueline Zhang, last modified on Sep 23, 2024

# Abstract

Hyperledger Labs AIFAQ is an LLM ChatBot testable as a Proof-of-Concept. It replies to questions about Hyperledger standard documentation. The current version is a Google Colab Notebook which uses Gradio as GUI. This project proposes an implementation of a standard ChatBot GUI and the deployment of a prototype. Our end goal is to have a more usable system installed on a Cloud Server.

# Timeline

**June 3 - June 23**

Onboarding

Understand the project scope and learn about LLM (Large Language Models)

- review the existing Hyperledger Labs AIFAQ documentation

Done**June 24 - July 5**

Understand the project scope and learn about LLM (Large Language Models)

- research and document the basics of LLM, focusing on how they can be applied to create intelligent ChatBots
- setup and familiarize with existing codespace

Done**July 8 - July 19**

Develop the front-end component of the ChatBot

- design a user-friendly interface for the ChatBot using JavaScript
- implement the interface as a functional prototype that can later be integrated with the backend LLM

Done**July 22 - July 26**1st Quarter EvaluationDone**July 29 - August 9**

Understand Cloud Architecture and Deployment

- research cloud service providers (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, Azure) and their offerings
- document the pros and cons of each service with respect to the project's needs and select one for deployment.
- begin the deployment of the front-end component as a test.

Done**August 12 - August 23**

Containerization

- research and document the basics of container technology (e.g., Docker).
- create a simple container for the ChatBot's front-end.

Done**August 26 - August 31**

Buffer Time &amp; Documentation

- catch up on documenting the current progress

Done**September 2 - September 6**Midterm EvaluationDone**September 9 - September 20**

Integration &amp; Testing

- integrate the front-end component with the LLM backend, ensuring they communicate effectively.
- conduct initial testing and document any issues or bugs.

Done**September 23 - October 4**

Cloud Server Deployment

- finalize the deployment of the ChatBot on the chosen cloud service
- perform comprehensive testing to ensure functionality and performance standards are met

**October 7 - October 11**

Buffer Time &amp; Documentation

**October 14 - October 18**3rd Quarter Evaluation  
**October 21 - November 1**

Project Documentation &amp; Quality Assurance
