# Hyperledger Mentorship Program : Project Plan - Hyperledger Caliper testability and robustness improvement.

Created by Babatunde Sanusi, last modified on Oct 03, 2024

## **Abstract**

Hyperledger Caliper is a blockchain benchmark platform that allows you to analyze different blockchain implementations in a variety of dimensions, such as performance, scalability, and latency. This project aims to increase Caliper's testability, test coverage, and robustness. To achieve this, the current testing framework of Caliper will be assessed for pain points and the need for improvement, and then comprehensive test suites will be designed and implemented.

## **Mentor and Mentee**

Mentor: Attila Klenik 

Timezone: CET

Mentee: Babatunde Sanusi

Timezone: WAT(GMT +1)

**Project repo:** 

[https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper](https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper)

## **Deliverables**

- Comprehensive Test Suites that covers all aspects of hyperledger caliper and ensures high test coverage
- Document details of the testing framework, test cases, and guides for future contribution to easily maintain test quality
- Implement CI/CD pipeline that automates the testing process, and ensures every contribution is thoroughly tested
- Detail the internal workings of caliper components to facilitate future contribution

## **Milestones**

**Eval 1:**

- Bump up the test framework and tools to the latest version
- Fix inconsistencies in test structure
- Add a section in the [contributor.md](http://contributor.md) document detailing the test framework and tools and their uses
- Using an example test suite, describe the methodology to add a test suite

**Eval 2:**

- add test for the untested modules in the folder: caliper-core/lib/worker/rate-control/
- add test for the untested modules in the folder: caliper-core/lib/worker/tx-observers/
- add test for the untested modules in the folder: caliper-core/lib/worker/worker-message-handler

**Eval 3:**

- add test for the untested modules in the folder: caliper-core/lib/manager/test-observers
- add test for the untested modules in the folder: caliper-core/lib/manager/monitors/
- add test for the untested modules in this folder: caliper-core/lib/manager/orchestrators/
- add test for the untested modules in this folder: caliper-core/lib/manager/report/

**Eval 4:**

- work on the CI/CD and test reporting for the project
- add test for the untested modules in the folder: caliper-core/lib/common/
