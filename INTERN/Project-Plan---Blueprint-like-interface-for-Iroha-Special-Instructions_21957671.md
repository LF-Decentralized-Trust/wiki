# Hyperledger Mentorship Program : Project Plan - Blueprint-like interface for Iroha Special Instructions

Created by Zoe Krucky, last modified on Aug 24, 2021

## **Abstract**

The goal of this project is to create an intuitive blueprint-like interface with block representations of Iroha Special Instructions for users to easily build their own smart contracts. The web application should allow the user to save and load programs that are currently in development as well as have the ability to serialize the constructed program into the raw byte representation of Iroha Special Instructions. Potential additional features include the ability to connect to the network and submit ISI to the ledger and provide automatic type analysis of the constructed programs. 

## **Mentors and Mentee**

Mentors: Egor Ivkov, Ivan Rybin

Mentee: Zoe Krucky

email: [zkrucky93@gmail.com](mailto:zkrucky93@gmail.com)

Timezone: Mountain Time (UTC-07:00)

## **Deliverables**

- Visual interface to construct smart contracts with block representations of ISI
- Ability to save and load programs that are currently in development
- Ability to serialize the constructed program into the raw byte representation of ISI
- (Optional) Ability to connect to the network and submit ISI to the ledger
- (Optional) Provide automatic type analysis of the constructed programs
