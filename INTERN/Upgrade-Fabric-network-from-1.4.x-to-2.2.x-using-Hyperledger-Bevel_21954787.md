**Project Title**Upgrade Fabric network from 1.4.x to 2.2.x using Hyperledger Bevel**Status**

COMPLETED

**Difficulty**

  MEDIUM 

# Description

[Hyperledger Bevel](https://github.com/hyperledger/bevel) supports production-worthy deployments for [Hyperledger Fabric](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric). And all production systems need to undergo updates which can often be live-updates. This project aims to complete a live upgrade of a Hyperledger Fabric network from version 1.4.x to 2.2.x using Hyperledger bevel and document the steps as well as make any changes needed to automate any steps possible.

# Additional Information

For a discussion of Hyperledger Bevel and [Bevel GitHub Issue #1845](https://github.com/hyperledger/bevel/issues/1845).

# Learning Objectives

You will learn production cloud deployments, upgrading of DLT platforms, security, and scripting, as well as key Hyperledger platforms such as Bevel, and Fabric.

# Expected Outcome

At the end of the project, we are looking for:

- Successful upgrade of Fabric network from 1.4.x to 2.2.x.
- Update to Hyperledger Bevel code to automate the process as much as possible.
- Update to Documentation of Bevel.
- Detailed tutorials and learning materials which would benefit Bevel and Fabric communities.
