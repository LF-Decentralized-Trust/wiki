Application Steps

## Step 1: review eligibility

The Hyperlegder Mentorship Program is aimed at providing a structured and guided learning opportunity for new developers, including college and university students, interested in becoming open source contributors to the Hyperledger community. Please first review the [eligibility requirements](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/INTERN/Eligibility) to determine if you're eligible to apply. 

## Step 2: discover projects

Carefully review the [Hyperledger mentorship projects that are in "Accepting Mentee Applications" status in 2024](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/INTERN/2024+Projects) and identify which project(s) you're interested in.

- Ask yourself which projects you are the most excited or curious about exploring? The project descriptions, learning objectives and outcomes, and any additional information or links on the project page may give you some insight.
- Ask yourself which projects are a better fit for your profile and align with your strength. Be sure to read about the educational level and skills required or desired to evaluate if you are qualified.
- Lastly, we expect mentees to be able to contribute ~20 hours a week on a consistent basis from June to November. Please make sure the [program timeline and schedule](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/INTERN/Hyperledger+Mentorship+Program#HyperledgerMentorshipProgram-2024ProgramDates*) will fit into your schedule and other academic, professional, or personal commitments.
- Each applicant may apply for multiple but no more than **THREE** projects. We recommend that you focus your effort on 2 projects and submit a quality application for those two projects.

## Step 3: ask questions (optional)

We encourage you to contact the Hyperledger Foundation staff and the mentors and community if you have questions about the program and/or the mentorship projects themselves.

- If your questions are about the program in general or the application process please contact [mentorship@hyperledger.org](mailto:mentorship@hyperledger.org)
- If you would like to clarify any technical aspects about a project, please join [Hyperledger Discord](https://discord.com/invite/hyperledger) and ask your questions on the corresponding project's public channels.
- Please be thoughtful with your questions and be respectful of the time it may take for the maintainers to respond to your questions.
- Public discussions benefit all who may be interested in the project and it helps efficiently address the same or similar questions many others may have. This is the open source way that we encourage applicants to adhere to.

## Step 4: prepare application materials

Besides collecting standard demographic and contact information on the application, we will ask you to upload your **resume and a** **cover letter.**The cover letter will ask you to address the following questions:

- How did you find out about our program?
- Why are you interested in the project(s) you're applying to?
- What experience and knowledge/skills do you have that are applicable to the requirements of the project(s) you're applying to?
- What do you hope to get out of this experience?
  
- Some projects may have additional requirements that ask your to demonstrate open source contribution experience. Please review carefully the requirements for the projects you're interested in applying to and prepare the materials accordingly.

Remember, your cover letter should not only demonstrate you're qualified but also show that you're passionate about becoming an active contributor in the Hyperledger open source community through this experience. 

## Step 5: apply on LFX Mentorship Platform

LFX Mentorship, developed by The Linux Foundation, of which Hyperledger is part of, is the portal where the Hyperledger mentorship projects are listed and mentee applications will be taken.

- Go to [LFX Mentorship Platform](https://mentorship.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/#projects_accepting)
- [Create Your Mentee Profile](https://docs.linuxfoundation.org/lfx/mentorship/mentees/create-a-mentee-profile) (you will need to [create an LFID](https://docs.linuxfoundation.org/lfx/sso/sign-in) first you don't already have one)
- Search by "Hyperledger" to see all Hyperledger projects open for application
- Click on the specific Hyperledger projects to read about the project details
- Be sure to "View Site" to take you to the corresponding wiki page for **complete** project information
- When ready, click "Apply" (remember you can apply up to 3 projects)
- Complete the application prerequisites including the latest resume and cover letter. Some may require that you supply additional information about your open source contribution experience. So please read the project details carefully.
- Please complete the application before the May 10th deadline for 2024.

Please review [detailed application instructions](https://docs.linuxfoundation.org/lfx/mentorship/mentees/apply-to-a-project) for additional information about how to apply on LFX Mentorship.
