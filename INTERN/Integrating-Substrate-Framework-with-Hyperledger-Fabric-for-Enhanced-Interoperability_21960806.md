# Hyperledger Mentorship Program : Integrating Substrate Framework with Hyperledger Fabric for Enhanced Interoperability

Created by Sara Rouhani, last modified by Saeed Moradi on Jun 28, 2024

**Project Title**

Integrating Substrate Framework with Hyperledger Fabric for Enhanced Interoperability

**Status**

IN PROGRESS

**Primary Focus**

CODING   RESEARCH

Project Overview:  This project investigates the integration of substrate framework with Hyperledger Fabric. Hyperledger Fabric is a permissioned blockchain platform designed for enterprise use cases, while Substrate is a flexible framework for building blockchains, allowing developers to create customized blockchains tailored to specific needs. The interoperability and integration of these two aim to bridge the gap between permissioned and public blockchain ecosystems, thereby extending the functionality and use case applicability of both. We aim to Shared Business Logic via Smart Contracts and Chaincode. The Objective is to enable shared business logic that operates across both Substrate and Hyperledger Fabric. This requires the implementation of business logic in a way that parts of it run on Substrate and other parts on Fabric, depending on the specific needs of the use case (e.g., public verification on Substrate, private transactions on Fabric). This will involve developing a common interface or standard for smart contracts or pallets on Substrate and Chaincode on Fabric to interact, allowing for data exchange, transaction validation, and cross-chain operations.

# Learning Objectives:

- Through hands-on experience, the mentee will learn to develop and implement shared business logic that operates seamlessly across the Substrate and Hyperledger Fabric platforms.
- The mentee will be trained in the design and deployment of smart contracts on Substrate and Chaincode on Hyperledger Fabric. This includes developing a common interface or standard that enables these contracts to communicate and interact across blockchain boundaries, facilitating data exchange and transaction validation.
- The mentee will be introduced to the culture of open-source development and encouraged to engage with the blockchain community at large.
- This training will prepare the mentee for professional roles requiring high standards of software quality and maintainability.

# Expected Outcome:

- The open-source implementation of the framework for integrating Substrate with Hyperledger Fabric, enabling interoperable operations and shared business logic execution.
- Report on testing and evaluation results of the project
- Demonstrated applicability of the integrated solution across multiple use cases, with documented benefits and potential limitations.
- Showcase the framework's utility through use case scenarios, outlining both the benefits and any encountered limitations.
- Project demo video
- An academic paper that discusses the system's architecture, design principles, implementation challenges, and evaluation findings.

# Relation to Hyperledger

 Hyperledger Fabric.

# Mentee Skills

Proficiency in Hyperledger Fabric smart contract development and network development. 

The mentee is also expected to have a solid grasp of the Substrate framework, with the capability to navigate its modular structure for building customized blockchain solutions.
