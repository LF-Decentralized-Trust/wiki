  Hello everyone, Just wanted to float an idea out there. This summer The Giving Chain was accepted into the Hyperledger Mentorship program and has entered into hyperledger labs. Our Giving Chain projects track donation on the sawtooth blockchain from donation point to recipients location. We are just starting to work on the sawtooth code to adjust it to meet out needs. We are interested in having a discussion with the sawtooth group for any and all advice. Just a heads up, we were thinking of joining your call next Friday, any chance we could get a few minutes on the agenda? Bobbi
