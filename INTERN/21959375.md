# Hyperledger Mentorship Program : Iroha 2: genesis generator

Created by Victor Gridnevsky, last modified by Min Yu on Apr 27, 2023

**Project Title**Genesis generator**Status**

UNSELECTED

**Primary Focus**

CODING

# Description

The genesis block is a crucial piece of data in a blockchain. In Iroha, it determines the initial permissions and the permission set activated in the blockchain. In a private blockchain, the permission set allows only a registration of a few initial accounts.

Setting information for the blockchain is not necessarily a task that technical people must undertake. We intend to produce a tool for generating the requisite block in a convenient, safe environment.

# Additional Information

Please refer to Iroha [documentation](https://hyperledger.github.io/iroha-2-docs/guide/configure/genesis.html) to learn more about the Genesis file.

# Learning Objectives

The intern shall learn the basics of tool design, primarily focusing on the UI/UX aspects, and a little about Rust-native toolchains and UI frameworks.

# Expected Outcome

A fully functional application that can produce some subset of a complete genesis block will be developed.

# Relation to Hyperledger

The project shall be part of Hyperledger Iroha tools.

# Mentee Skills

- basic understanding of [nominal type systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nominal_type_system)
- knowledge of or willingness to learn [contract-based programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_by_contract)
- interest in learning the frontend programming

Useful, but not required:

- Rust experience.
- Knowledge of the [`serde`](https://serde.rs/) serialisation &amp; deserialisation framework.
- The understanding of Fintech mathematical operations and precision (or scientific computation) ([decimal point](https://www.fpcomplete.com/blog/safe-decimal-right-on-the-money/), [dangers of floating point](https://peterdev.pl/2018/08/24/learn-how-to-count-money-or-you-will-lose-it/), [and double](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19978294/using-double-for-financial-software)).
- The knowledge or willingness to learn either [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) or one of the Rust UI libraries like [Tauri](https://tauri.app/), [Relm](https://github.com/antoyo/relm), [Slint](https://slint-ui.com/) and [Iced](https://github.com/iced-rs/iced).

# Future plans

This project will result in an actively supported part of Iroha, which would be helpful for any DevOps setting it up.
