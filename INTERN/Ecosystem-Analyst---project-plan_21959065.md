# Hyperledger Mentorship Program : Ecosystem Analyst - project plan

Created by Tomaz Sedej, last modified on Jun 21, 2022

**Project Title**Ecosystem Analyst Project Plan

# Description

Implementations of Hyperledger technologies span multiple industries, including finance, supply chain, trade, health, media, telecom and more. The beauty of our open source technology community is that anyone can use and build upon it for their specific needs and use cases. There are hundreds of implementations and capturing them in an easy to find and useful manner is a key enabling tool. Helping our community and the public to better understand use cases is a key part of helping advance the impact of distributed ledger technology. It validates ideas others have, provides avenues for reaching out and sharing lessons learned, and is a key part of building the Hyperledger community. In addition, we would also like to track academic papers and courses related to Hyperledger projects in order to develop an understanding of the academic landscape. Different tools can be used to identify relevant and value-adding academic papers (i.e. arXiv, Google Scholar, Web of Science).

In gathering and organizing the above information, the mentee will leverage their broad view of Hyperledger use cases as well as understanding of the overall blockchain space to identify potential opportunities for growth in uses or applications of Hyperledger technology. This can include use cases where our community isn’t as present, where we can explore doing further outreach and education. In addition, the mentee will make recommendations and potentially also work on developing ways for the use case and academic information to be leveraged for educational and ecosystem-building content and activities such as best practice guides, ebooks, webinars, workshops, etc.

# Learning Objectives

- Gain specific and broad understanding of the applications of blockchain technology
- Learn about cutting edge research on Hyperledger technologies
- Learn and apply data collection, database organization, and market analysis skills
- Be able to understand the needs of various stakeholders and how to share and communicate information in a way that is relevant and impactful

# Deliverables

- **Use case tracker:** Continue adding use cases to the current tracker, using Airtable. The goal is to have 200 use cases in the tracker by the end of mentorship.
- **Academic tracker:** Continue adding academic papers to the current tracker, using Airtable. The goal is to have 100 academic papers in the tracker by the end of mentorship.
- **Other deliverables:** 
  
  - Based on the research done for updating both trackers, the mentee identifies and proposes new areas of growth for Hyperledger use cases and ecosystem development (e.g. identifying institutions potentially eligible for membership)
  - Produce or facilitate creation of 2-4 pieces of content (eBook,blog post - any ideas?) leveraging the database information

# Method

**Use case tracker**

- Review current tracker (particularly **Sector/Industry**, **Status**, and **Description** fields. Adding and modifying information as needed)
- Review sources of data and add relevant use cases to the tracker
- Conduct own research and identify other relevant use cases for the tracker
- Review the list of members and add their use cases to the tracker
- Identify the best way for the community to be updating the tracker

**Academic tracker**

- Use resources for finding academic research (i.e. arXiv, Google Scholar, Web of Science) and add academic papers (both business and technical) to tracker
- Identify academic institutions offering courses relevant for Hyperledger
