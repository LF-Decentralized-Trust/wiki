# Hyperledger Mentorship Program : Project Plan: Decentralized Identity Management for Data Sharing in Cacti

Created by Venkatraman Ramakrishna, last modified on Oct 17, 2023

## **Abstract**

Build reference decentralized identity registry based on Hyperledger Indy and identity-syncing protocols among permissioned DLTs using Group DIDs.

**Project repo:** [https://github.com/hyperledger/cacti](https://github.com/hyperledger/cacti)

## **Deliverables**

- Augment Indy Plenum with support for managing Group DIDs representing DLT networks
- Augment Indy SDK to add methods to create and manage Group DIDs
  
  - (Optional) Augment Indy VDR (future replacement for Indy SDK) to add methods to create and manage Group DIDs
- Create sample Indy testnet as model IIN (verifiable data registry) with support for maintaining Group DIDs and associated VCs
- Create trust anchor module built on Hyperledger Aries to represent a consortium that issues VCs to a group represented by a Group DID
- Upgrade Cacti Fabric IIN Agent to connect to an IIN and sync identities and certificates from another network
- Create Cacti Corda IIN Agent to connect to an IIN and sync identities and certificates from another network
- Write appropriate configuration files for IIN Agents, IIN Trust Anchors, and IIN testnet
- Update Corda CLI to launch IIN Agents
- Unit and Integration tests
- Update Decentralized Identity-related RFCs
- Write tutorial documents for users to configure and launch an IIN and appropriate IIN Agents for the participating DLT networks

## **Merged PR's**

## **Final Project Presentation:**

- **TBD**

## **Milestones**

**Eval 1:**

- Research: understand Indy networks, DID and VC concepts, Indy SDK, existing Cacti-Weaver identity management protocols (RFCs)
  
- Update design specifications (RFCs) as required based on research output
  
- Implement: Indy Plenum support for Group DIDs (using partially existing code as the base)
  

**Eval 2:**

- Implement: Indy SDK support for Group DIDs
  
- Implement and configure: Sample IIN
  
- Implement: trust anchor module
- Publish Docker images for IIN and trust anchor modules

**Eval 3:**

- Implement: Fabric IIN Agents to depend on IINs and sync memberships (with unit tests)
  
- Demonstrate end-to-end data sharing for Fabric networks using IIN Agents
  
- Implement: Corda IIN Agents to depend on IINs and sync memberships (with unit tests)

**Eval 4:**

- Implement: Corda CLI support to configure and launch IIN Agents
- Write tutorial documentation to guide users
- Add appropriate Github Actions for integration testing
- TBD: Optional deliverables
