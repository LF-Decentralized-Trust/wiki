# Hyperledger Mentorship Program : Hyperledger Fabric Test Configuration for Project Management in Construction and Engineering

Created by George Blumberg, last modified by Min Yu on Mar 18, 2020

Hyperledger Project Mentor/Mentee programme proposal

**Title**

Hyperledger Fabric Test Configuration for Project Management in Construction and Engineering

**Status**

UNSELECTED

**Difficulty**

  HIGH  

# Description

This is a document that describes the project plan for an internship that is designed to advance a prototype system in the application of Hyperledger Composer for providing governance in Construction and Engineering projects (c&amp;e).  Through simulation and advanced configuration, testing and evaluation, this project is designed to advance the technology towards a commercial application.  In a previous phase of the project, computer architecture was developed that provided a closed, private network for multiple trading partners.  The long-term goal is to make use of the ground-up assemblage participation in the network that can provide governance for a wide range of transactions.   These include deliveries, installation, payment, inspection, and certification and general administrative functions.  This second phase of the project will progress the technology to the next level.  **Keywords:** Blockchains, project governance in construction and engineering projects

# Learning Objectives

For this particularly project (Phase 2) the specific, short-term, achievable learning objectives are:

- Provide a positive educational experience for a student developer by allowing them to write code and to contribute to a commercially-focused project.
- Develop the project to be public facing by creating useful and engaging user experience that explain and educate.

Build on the past phase of mentor programme by integrating the past mentee into the current project.

# Expected Outcome

In terms of the project itself, the objective are: to identify design, test and evaluate blockchains to improve the management of c&amp;e projects, by completing the following tasks.

- Upgrade system to include the latest version of Hyperledger Fabric (hlf)
- Replace project code written in Hypeledger Composer (“Composer”) with suitable alternative (after some research into this transfer).
- Replicate the already designed system architecture and network configuration in a test setup both with the mentor and the mentee.
- Establish a set of tools to use to test live functions of Hyperledger system for c&amp;e assembly and administrative processes.
- Design and test procedure for business process modelling, and consider a pilot project that will be further refined and made suitable for public use.
- The long-term and overarching aims of this programme are to lead to the development of a professional software package using blockchain technology that will provide significant and cost effective solutions to managers of construction and engineering projects.  This long-term aim requires completion of a number of stages of development, each of which builds on the success of the previous one.

# Relation to Hyperledger

The first phase of this project was successfully completed in time based on the objectives set out in the proposal.  During this phase, a number of notable accomplishments were made that will be built upon in the second phase of the project.  Firstly, an analysis of the state of blockchain technology enabled the design for construction and engineering project management was designed.

Using a series of carefully crafted diagrams (for example: by class, activity and sequence) and smart contract schematics according to actions of participants as derived from a flow diagram.  We have also seen the creation of an access control list that defines the actions of participant in the blockchain system.  This forms the basis for the membership management system, likely to be the core administrative tool when in-use and aided by the introduction of identity cards.   Additionally, we have created a range of smart contracts that are coupled to the members interface.  This help control access to smart contracts in blockchain system.  Work on the channel aspect of Hyperledger has also progressed significantly, including the control of access to data of participants as well as the history of transactions.

On the developer’s side, we have generated a set of Web-APIs for using blockchain system and created a basic website and user-interface for users.   For reporting, a set of templates were made to allow easy viewing of all the smart contracts on the system, the history of transaction according to access rights of participant and the linkage of data in blockchain system to a Gantt chart for illustrating tasks of current project.  This shows tasks are they are completed and smart contracts fulfilled.   Lean management of the system has also been initiated and it is now possible to general basic project statistics and performance reports based on data from the blockchain. 

One very positive outcome is that the mentee in the first phase of the project (Tung Anh Nguyen) has agreed to act as unpaid contributor in Phase 2. He will review contributions, add text and comments to the code and help train the new trainee/mentee. 

# Education Level

The successful candidate should be nearing the end of a university course in computer science or related subject and have good proficiency with coding and learning how to install new software. 

# Skills

The skill level of the mentee should be at the stage of proficient and confident senior student.  Basic programming and communication skills are a must.   The ability to get up to speed with Hyperledger and associated languages needed to implement the system are essential.  Phase 1 of the project has been written and should provide a good springboard for the next phase.  However, it is understandable that the level of academic English might not be that important. 

# Future plans

This is a long-term programme that will be accomplished by the assemblage of a number of linked projects.  If blockchains are to live up their hype (see Swan, 2015), then they will need significant testing and prototyping before they are launched as a produce.  The application of the technology to commercial activities (Hultgren and Pajala, 2018; Turk and Klinc, 2017), including for construction and engineering (c&amp;e) assembly and administration (Penzes 2018; Hultgren and Pajala, 2018) is still just a promise.  We are encouraged by the fast-moving nature of this technology. For example, it may now be possible to arrange secure payments using smart contracts embedded in the blockchain by making use of commercial services.  Indeed, further automation of a range of assembly and administration processes could provide broad benefits across an industry that is known for low productivity and profits (Barbosa et al., 2017).  Additional features of the technology can provide similar functionality as Enterprise Resource Management (erm) system, providing a low-cost alternative to these solutions. 

The long-term and overarching aims of this programme are to lead to the development of a professional software package using blockchain technology that will provide significant and cost effective solutions to managers of construction and engineering projects.  This long-term aim requires completion of a number of stages of development, each of which builds on the success of the previous one.  

# Preferred Hours and Length of Internship

It is preferred that this mentee take on a part-time (20 hours a week for 24 weeks starting in summer and ending in fall) commitment with respect to this project.
