**Project Title**

## Hyperledger Web3j: Enhancing Android Support with Updated web3j-android Integration

**Status**

IN PROGRESS

**Primary Focus**

CODING DOCUMENTATION  

# Description

The Hyperledger Web3j-android library is pivotal for developers integrating Android applications with Ethereum blockchain, leveraging the robust capabilities of Hyperledger web3j in a mobile context. Despite its critical role, the current state of web3j-android, last updated to version 4.8.8, faces challenges in coherence, functionality, and modern Android development practices. This project proposes a comprehensive update and restructuring of the web3j-android library to align with the latest Android development standards and Ethereum blockchain technologies.

# Learning Objectives

- To establish a unified and coherent versioning and release strategy for web3j-android that aligns with web3j core releases, ensuring seamless functionality across platforms.
- To enhance compatibility by updating the library to support the latest Android SDK versions, ensuring it meets modern app development requirements.
- To refactor existing codebase for improving support and compatibility in Android context
- To introduce comprehensive testing and documentation, providing a solid foundation for developers to contribute and leverage the library effectively.

# Expected Outcome and Deliverables

### Scope

- Evaluation and Planning: Conduct a review of the current web3j-android architecture, dependencies, and Android development guidelines to draft a detailed plan.
- Versioning Strategy Revision: Analyze the current state of versioning and branch management to propose and implement a streamlined process.
- Android Compatibility: Adjust the minSDKVersion and targetSDKVersion to widen the library's applicability, focusing on compatibility with recent Android versions without sacrificing support for older devices.
- Java Compatibility: Address issues arising from sourceCompatibility and targetCompatibility with Java versions supported by Android, ensuring the library utilizes Android-compatible Java APIs.
- Dependency Management: Review and update gradle.properties to ensure all dependencies are compatible with Android development standards, reducing conflicts and build issues.
- Testing and Documentation: Develop a robust suite of tests and comprehensive documentation to facilitate easy adoption and contribution by the community.

**The successful completion of this project will result in a revitalised web3j-android library that is well-documented, easy to use, and fully supports modern Android development practices. It will serve as a crucial tool for developers building decentralised applications on Android devices, fostering innovation and growth in the blockchain ecosystem.**

# Relation to Hyperledger and Impact on the community

Web3j has recently become the newest member of the Hyperledger family, marking a significant step towards bridging the Ethereum ecosystem with enterprise blockchain needs. You can learn more about this integration in the official announcement on the Hyperledger blog: [Introducing Hyperledger Web3j: The Ethereum Integration Library for Enterprises](https://www.hyperledger.org/blog/introducing-hyperledger-web3j-the-ethereum-integration-library-for-enterprises?hs_preview=QaNMhWBX-156319447204). This inclusion is poised to open up avenues for developers to familiarise themselves with web3j, encouraging contributions and enhancements to the project.

# Recommended Skills

1. Strong Understanding of Android Development: Knowledge of Android SDK, Android Studio, and the Android app development lifecycle.
2. Very good understanding of Java and Kotlin: Since Android development can involve both languages, familiarity with Java and Kotlin is essential, especially considering the existing web3j-android library is in Java, and new developments in Android often leverage Kotlin.
3. Experience with Ethereum and Smart Contracts: Understanding of Ethereum blockchain, smart contracts, and how they interact with Android applications using web3j.
4. Familiarity with web3j Library: A grasp of the existing web3j library functionalities, structures, and its application in Android environments.
5. Knowledge of Blockchain Principles: Basics of blockchain technology, including consensus algorithms, transaction processing, and blockchain data structures.
6. Problem-Solving Skills: Ability to diagnose and troubleshoot complex issues that may arise during development or integration of blockchain technologies in Android applications.
7. Version Control with Git: Experience with Git for version control to manage code changes and collaborate with other developers.
8. Communication and Collaboration Skills: Ability to work effectively in a team, articulate ideas clearly, and collaborate on complex projects.
