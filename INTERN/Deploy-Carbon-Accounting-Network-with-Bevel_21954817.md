# Hyperledger Mentorship Program : Deploy Carbon Accounting Network with Bevel

Created by Si Chen, last modified by Min Yu on Dec 19, 2022

**Project Title**Deploy the Hyperledger Labs project for Blockchain Carbon Accounting using Bevel**Status**

COMPLETED

**Difficulty**

  HIGH

# Description

The [Hyperledger Labs blockchain-carbon-accounting project](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/blockchain-carbon-accounting) has progressed significantly, and we're looking to move to production deployment of it.  The deployment of a Hyperledger Fabric, however, has been a difficult and time consuming process in the past.  Working with the maintainers of [Hyperledger Bevel](https://www.hyperledger.org/use/bevel), we would like to streamline the deployment processes for both Fabric and Besu networks.  Our goal is to allow any organization to join the networks using its own cloud infrastructure.

# Additional Information

For additional information, see [2022-01-31 Peer Programming Call](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CASIG/pages/19008808/2022-01-31+Peer+Programming+Call) for a discussion of Hyperledger Bevel and [Bevel github task #1826](https://github.com/hyperledger/bevel/issues/1826).

# Learning Objectives

You will learn production cloud deployments, working with multiple cloud computing platforms, security, and scripting, as well as key Hyperledger platforms such as Bevel, Fabric, and Besu.

# Expected Outcome

At the end of the project, we are looking for:

- Successful deployment of blockchain-carbon-accounting across multiple cloud networks, such as Digital Ocean, AWS, and Azure.
- Scripts for further maintenance of the networks.
- Detailed tutorials and learning materials which would benefit both blockchain-carbon-accounting developers and the broader Fabric, Besu, and Bevel communities.
