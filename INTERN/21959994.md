# Hyperledger Mentorship Program : Project Plan: Implement the Secure Asset Transfer Protocol in Cacti

Created by Venkatraman Ramakrishna, last modified on Nov 14, 2023

## **Abstract**

Implement the IETF Secure Asset Transfer Protocol according to proposed drafts (precursor to official RFCs) in Cacti using Relays.

**Project repo:** [https://github.com/hyperledger/cacti](https://github.com/hyperledger/cacti)

## **Deliverables**

- Augment Cacti Relay module to implement the IETF SATP (Secure Asset Transfer Protocol)
  
  - Relay as asset source
  - Relay as asset destination
- Failover and recovery support in the Cacti Relay module
- Augment Fabric driver to handle SATP asset transfer instructions received from relays
- Augment Fabric Interoperation SDK to trigger and manage asset transfers using SATP
- Augment Fabric CLI to run and demonstrate an end-to-end instance of asset transfer
- (Optional) Augment Corda Interoperation SDK to trigger and manage asset transfers using SATP
- (Optional) Augment Corda CLI to run and demonstrate an end-to-end instance of asset transfer
- Demonstrate asset transfers across Fabric networks using the SATP
- (Optional) Demonstrate asset transfers across any combination of Fabric and Corda networks using the SATP
- Unit and Integration tests
- Write RFCs around the design and implementation of SATP using relays (final design specs will be an outcome of experimentation, and will be adjusted to reflect the latest IETF SATP draft specs.)
- Write tutorial documents for users to configure and run testnets and applications and move assets across them
- Propose updates to the IETF SATP drafts
- (Optional) Port SATP logic from Relay to Node Server (older implementation using ODAP)

## **Merged PR's**

- **TBD**

## **Final Project Presentation:**

- **TBD**

## **Milestones**

**Eval 1:**

- Research: understand the SATP by reading the drafts, read about distributed commit protocols
- Get hands-on with relay and driver code within Cacti
- Implement: basic relay support for round-trip messaging
  
- Implement: Stage 1: Steps 1.1 - 1.4: happy path and error handling
  

**Eval 2:**

- Implement: remainder of the steps: 2.1 - 3.9: happy pat and error handling
  
- Implement: Fabric Interoperation SDK support

**Eval 3:**

- Implement: Fabric CLI additions to orchestrate asset transfers using this protocol
- Demonstrate asset transfer across Fabric networks
- Write tutorial documentation to guide users
- Add appropriate Github Actions for integration testing

**Eval 4:**

- Relay support for crash (fault) monitoring and recovery
- Write design specifications (RFCs) for SATP-based asset transfer

<!--THE END-->

- TBD: Optional deliverables
