# Artifacts showcasing Learning and Growth:

- During my mentorship period, I wrote a blog highlighting my learning of Hyperledger Fabric(for HLF Connector) and my growth as a mentee.
  
  - Link to my blog: [https://subhranilraha.hashnode.dev/getting-started-with-hyperledger-fabric](https://subhranilraha.hashnode.dev/getting-started-with-hyperledger-fabric)
  - I will also be contributing to the project in the future as an open-source developer
