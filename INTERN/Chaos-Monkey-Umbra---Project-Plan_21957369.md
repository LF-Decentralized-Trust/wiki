# Hyperledger Mentorship Program : Chaos Monkey Umbra - Project Plan

Created by Nima Afraz, last modified by Sean Bohan on Jul 31, 2023

**Overview**

This document contains the roadmap of activities to accomplish the topics proposed by the 2021 internship project named [Chaos Monkey Engineering in Umbra Scalability Tests](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/INTERN/Chaos+Monkey+Engineering+in+Umbra+Scalability+Tests). 

The source code and documentation of this project are going to be sent as a pull request to the main umbra repository [https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/umbra](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/umbra). 

During the development of the project, a fork of this repository will be used for the activities below:

**Activities**

1. Understand Umbra architecture (components and messages)
2. Debugging the installation errors and create a stable installation process
3. Improving the installation [README.md](http://README.md) documentation
   
   1. Adding more detailed steps
   2. Recording a video tutorial of the installation process and running an example
   3. Updating the readthedocs documentation for the entire project
4. Creating a new communication channel to attract new developers and users
   
   1. Hyperledger uses Discord for chat: [https://discord.gg/hyperledger](https://discord.gg/hyperledger)
   2. Creating issues in the repo with the common errors in installation
5. Running cloud-based experiments with the stable version of the Umbra
   
   1. Single cloud, Single-region
   2. Single cloud, Multi-region
   3. Hybrid cloud
6. Defining experimental scenarios for testing umbra-based blockchain networks
   
   1. Dead node/peer test with various consensus protocols (Solo, Kafka, Raft)
   2. Experiments to push the scalability of the Fabric networks
7. A draft of an Academic article reporting the results
