# Hyperledger Mentorship Program : Project Plan - Towards Blockchain Interoperability with Hyperledger

Created by Sara Ghaemi, last modified on Nov 18, 2020

# Overview

The use of blockchains in different industries has increased dramatically in the past few years. This increase has resulted in many blockchains being created which are working in isolation from each other. In order to enable the full potential of blockchain networks, interoperability solutions are needed for transferring or sharing data across these networks. The goal of this project is to propose a solution for blockchain interoperability in permissioned blockchain networks.
