# Hyperledger Mentorship Program : Iroha 2: Kagami GUI

Created by Victor Gridnevsky, last modified by Min Yu on Apr 27, 2023

**Project Title**Iroha 2 Kagami GUI**Status**

UNSELECTED

**Primary Focus**

CODING 

# Description

Iroha v2 has an accompanying tool called Kagami that is designed to produce references, examples for documentation and all of the configuration files. While the CLI version of Kagami has been used successfully, the GUI version will be convenient in many more situations.

The task of creating a convenient GUI fit for purpose is the primary goal of this internship.

# Additional Information

[Kagami](https://hyperledger.github.io/iroha-2-docs/guide/glossary.html#kagami-teacher-and-exemplar-and-or-looking-glass) in Iroha documentation.

# Learning Objectives

The mentee shall learn to produce a pre-existing tool’s graphical user interface (GUI) frontend.

# Expected Outcome

The Iroha v2 Kagami shall be accompanied by a graphical application, Kagami-GUI, which acts as a graphical frontend for the existing Kagami binary.

# Relation to Hyperledger

Kagami is a part of Hyperledger Iroha 2 project.

# Mentee Skills
