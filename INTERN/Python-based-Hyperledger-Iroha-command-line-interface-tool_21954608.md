# Hyperledger Mentorship Program : Python-based Hyperledger Iroha command-line interface tool

Created by Nikolay Yushkevich, last modified by Min Yu on Mar 22, 2019

**Title**HL Iroha CLI tool**Status**

UNSELECTED

**Difficulty**

LOW

# Description

Hyperledger Iroha is currently lacking nice to use console tool for fast transaction/query forming/sending, as its existing tool got outdated ([https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/tree/master/iroha-cli](https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/tree/master/iroha-cli)) and is not really handy to operate with. We need to build a replacement on a basis of any existing SDK (Python 3+ is preferred)
