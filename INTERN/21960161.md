# Hyperledger Mentorship Program : Project plan - Mini game to explore decentralized Identity &amp; Payments in Gaming

Created by Sandy Aggarwal, last modified on Nov 12, 2023

## **Abstract**

This project is meant to serve as a proof-of-concept for implementing decentralized identity and payment rails in the gaming (and by extension, potentially a future metaverse) ecosystem.

## **Mentor and Mentee**

Mentor: Sandy Aggarwal

Timezone: Eastern Time (EST), USA

Mentee: Kyle Liu

Timezone: Currently PST until mid Aug. EST from mid Aug onwards. 

Fork of official repository for this project: TBD

## **Deliverables**

This project has following two deliverables: 

1. A mini game project which will serve as a proof-of-concept (POC) to demonstrate use of decentralized identity and payment systems using Hyperledger chains such as Indy &amp; Aries for Identity and Firefly for digital assets
2. Research paper to document currently predominant methods used for identity and payments in the gaming space and recommendations on how implement digital wallets for storing credentials and digital assets

## **Milestones**

### **Evaluation 1 (July 28, 2023):**

- Review problem statement as defined in in the goal of the project and assess technology choices for creation of a mini-game
- Bootstrap the game using appropriate game engine and technology for crude PoC
- Create &amp; draft of game design document (GDD) for the mini-game to be developed
- Establish DevOps, documentation and collaboration tools for this game project
