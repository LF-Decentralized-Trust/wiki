# Hyperledger Mentorship Program : Project Plan - Hyperledger Fabric CC-Tools Support for Fabric Private Chaincode

Created by Osama Magdy, last modified on Sep 16, 2024

# Abstract

Fabric Private Chaincode (FPC) uses Confidential Computing technology like Intel SGX to protect chaincode and data during execution on endorsing peers. Client applications interact with private chaincode via the FPC Client SDK, which encrypts and authenticates invocation arguments before sending them to endorsing peers. Chaincodes can be developed in C++ or Golang.

The Hyperledger Labs CC-Tools library simplifies learning, developing, and deploying Hyperledger Fabric chaincode in Golang.

Our project aims to design and integrate FPC as a target for code developed using CC-Tools, including creating samples and documentation.

**Official Repositories:**

- **FPC: [https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-private-chaincode](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-private-chaincode)**
- **CC-Tools [https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/cc-tools](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/cc-tools)**

# Mentor and Mentee

**Mentors:** Marcus Brandenburger, Maria Munaro, Samuel Venzi

**Mentee:** Osama Magdy

# Deliverables

- Design and implementation of integration of FPC into the CC-Tools
- Sample applications demonstrating the use of the new CC-Tool integration
