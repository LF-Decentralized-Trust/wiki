# Hyperledger Mentorship Program : Extending HL Fabric for connecting with HL Indy

Created by Harris Niavis, last modified by Min Yu on Mar 22, 2019

**Title**

Extending HL Fabric for connecting with HL Indy

**Status**

UNSELECTED

**Difficulty**

MEDIUM  

# Description

Hyperledger project provides an umbrella for several open-source distributed ledger frameworks, designed for both specific and generic purposes. Hyperledger Fabric is a modular and extendable code-base for building distributed ledgers in diverse fields ranging from medical research to banking and supply chain. On the other hand, Hyperledger Indy is a purpose-built distributed ledger for decentralized identity.

At the moment Hyperledger Fabric incorporates its own Membership Service for assigning digital identities to individuals and devices as well as for defining their roles and privileges in the network.  In the context of this project we will design and develop a custom Membership Service Provider (MSP) in Fabric for managing digital identities using a decentralized identity management system (Indy). The custom MSP will be the interface between Fabric and Indy and will translate requests and responses coming from Indy to Fabric and vice-versa.

Relation to Hyperledger 

Hyperledger Fabric and Hyperledger Indy

# Education Level

Graduate student or undergraduate student.

# Skills

Languages: Go, Python

Blockchain platforms: Hyperledger Fabric (basic), Hyperledger Indy (basic)
