# Description

Implement message mediator service written in Rust with pick-up v2 protocol support on top of `aries-vcx` crate.

# Additional Information

- pick-up protocol v2 [https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/main/features/0685-pickup-v2](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/main/features/0685-pickup-v2)
- aries message mediation [https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/main/concepts/0046-mediators-and-relays/README.md](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/main/concepts/0046-mediators-and-relays/README.md)

# Learning Objectives

- Learn about self sovereign identity and **Aries protocols**
- Learn about writing scalable server applications
- Learn **Rust language**
- Learn **Github Actions** and CI process in general

# Expected Outcome

- Web service for Aries message mediation
- CI jobs to test the implementation

# Relation to Hyperledger

[https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-vcx](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-vcx/tree/main/aries_vcx)

# Mentee Skills

\- Experience with programming, no specific technologies required

# Future plans

The project will likely be integrated with other components of aries-vcx repository. Not only that however - building high-performance mediation service can be valuable for entire Hyperledger Aries community.
