# Hyperledger Mentorship Program : aries-vcx next-gen mobile wrapper

Created by Patrik Stas, last modified by Min Yu on Dec 18, 2023

**Project Title**aries-vcx next-gen mobile wrapper**Status**

COMPLETED

**Primary Focus**

CODING 

# Description

Implement rust wrapper around `aries-vcx`  to enable consuming the library in mobile setting using modern FFI approach using `uniffi` library. Additionally implement aries mediator client to unlock full mobile support.

# Additional Information

Currently there's a basic POC [https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-vcx/tree/main/uniffi\_aries\_vcx](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-vcx/tree/main/uniffi_aries_vcx)

# Learning Objectives

- Learn about self sovereign identity and **Aries protocols**
- Learn **Rust language**
- Learn basics of **Kotlin language**, basics of **Android** development
- Learn **Github Actions** and CI process in general
- Learn about **FFI** (Foreign Function Interface) by using uniffi library

# Expected Outcome

- `uniffi_aries_vcx`  rust crate which generate mobile bindings for aries-vcx library
- implement mediator client with aries message pick-up protocol support
- simple android demo application which can be run in simulator
- CI job to build Kotlin and iOS bindings, CI job to test the wrapper

# Relation to Hyperledger

# Mentee Skills

\- Experience with programming, no specific technologies required

# Future plans

\- The project will likely get adopted by companies building native SSI wallets with aries/didcomm support. The project will become one of the main components of `aries-vcx` repository.
