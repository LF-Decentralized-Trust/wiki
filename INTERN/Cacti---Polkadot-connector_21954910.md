# Hyperledger Mentorship Program : Cacti - Polkadot connector

Created by Jagpreet Singh Sasan, last modified by Min Yu on Feb 01, 2024

**Project Title**Cacti - Polkadot connector**Status**

COMPLETED

**Primary Focus**

CODING DOCUMENTATION  RESEARCH

# Description

Creation of polkadot connector plugin, alongside its cactus-polkadot-all-in-one docker image (hosting a sample polkadot ledger for testing purposes) and the test-tooling package for the AIO

# Additional Information

[This issue](https://github.com/hyperledger/cacti/issues/726) tracks the progress of the connector and can be used to track the progress of the connector itself.  
We would like to have the code merged into Cacti codebase at the end using a progressive commit history approach (That is, hitting each major milestone can have a single commit to it, so that later on, this one PR, with multiple commits, can be used as a reference to showcase connector development lifecycle)

## Milestones

(Each milestone is set to be achieved within a timespan of 2 weeks, subject to change upon creation of the actual project plan)

(Each commit milestone to have a single, highly descriptive commit to keep track of he connector development lifecycle, as discussed above)

- Understand cacti codebase and the supplychain example (to understand what functionalities is generally expected from a connector)
- Understand a single connector (like besu connector) and its development lifecycle (how the connector is gradually created by first having its dockerised AIO, then its test tooling, then generation of code using a master openapi spec file, and then wiring up everything alongside the creation of the main connector class and finally having the connector README docs)
- Creation of polkadot AIO image (part1)
- COMMIT - 1: Creation of polkadot AIO image (part2) (this will take up time, thus dividing into 2 parts)
- COMMIT - 2: Creation of polkadot test tooling
- Creation of polkadot connector openapi specs, basic test case and connector class with base functions (part 1)
- COMMIT - 3: Creation of polkadot connector openapi specs, basic test case and connector class with base functions (part 2) (This will take up significant time, thus dividing into 2 parts)
- Updation of the openapi specs, test cases and addition of the rest of the code as per the requirements observed in commit 3 test cases (part 1)
- COMMIT - 4; Updation of the openapi specs, test cases and addition of the rest of the code as per the requirements observed in commit 3 test cases (part 2) (this will take up the most time, thus dividing into 2 parts)
- COMMIT - 5: Creation of README.md for the connector plugin and architecture reference diagrams
- Creation of PR with the 5 progressive commits and incorporation of review comments
- Creation of final presentation/demo to showcase the work done in this project

# Learning Objectives

- Hyperledger Cacti codebase
- Hyperledger Cacti connector design
- Understanding of various interoperability solutions, design and usage of cactus api server

# Expected Outcome

- Creation of polkadot connector
- Creation of polkadot all in one docker image
- Creation of polkadot test tooling classes
- Documentation, architecture reference diagrams for the polkadot connector

# Relation to Hyperledger

Hyperledger Cacti

# Mentee Skills

- Expertise in JS/TS coding environments
- Prior knowledge/hands-on experience related to Cacti and its connectors

# Future plans

This project will provide the polkadot connector to the Cacti codebase which can be leveraged in future to showcase more interoperability solutions
