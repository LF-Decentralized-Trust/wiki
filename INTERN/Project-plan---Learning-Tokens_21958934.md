# Hyperledger Mentorship Program : Project plan - Learning Tokens

Created by josehenriquez.niu, last modified on Jan 17, 2023

## **Abstract**

Learning Tokens is a mechanism that uses the composable Interwork Alliance Token Taxonomy Framework (IWA TTF) to produce a Learning Token as a positive reinforcer that recognizes, registers, and rewards community engagement in collective learning, and also certifying skills acquisition and competencies.

## **Methodology**

My work strategy for the following 24 weeks are based on the following premises:

- Following and completing each activity described on the timeline and on each milestone as it is.
- As I start working on each task, I'll keep in touch with my mentor, and we'll meet every week once or twice to discuss ideas.
- Documenting every meeting and work that is part of the mentorship to keep everything transparent and clear.
- If something unexpected comes up, I'll get in touch right away with my mentor, so we can find a suitable solution to keep up with everything.
