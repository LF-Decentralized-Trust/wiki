**Primary Focus**

CODING 

# Description

The Iroha 2 blockchain explorer is a web-based UI that inspects the entire state of an Iroha v2-based blockchain. In the scope of this internship, the mentee shall learn how to construct a frontend service to a blockchain, organise the UI and cater to unique challenges associated with the specific needs of specific blockchain ledgers such as Hyperledger Iroha v2.

# Additional Information

Blockchain Explorer [backend](https://github.com/soramitsu/iroha2-block-explorer-backend) and [frontend](https://github.com/soramitsu/iroha2-block-explorer-web).

# Learning Objectives

The mentee shall learn how to:

- Build a web-based UI in Vue.
- Connect said Web-based UI to a backend service.
- Implement UTF-8-based encoding of public keys (optional).
- Learn about UI/UX challenges associated with making things work cross-platform, cross-form-factor.

# Expected Outcome

The state of the Iroha v2 blockchain explorer shall be improved.

# Relation to Hyperledger

The blockchain explorer is the most likely element of Iroha with which users of Hyperledger Iroha v2 shall interact.

# Mentee Skills

- Basic knowledge of Rust
- Experience with any modern JavaScript / TypeScript framework

Desired, but not required skills:

- Backend development experience.
- Experience using Vue and Vite.

# Future plans

Blockchain Explorer is a project necessary for Iroha 2, and it'll be supported as much as possible.
