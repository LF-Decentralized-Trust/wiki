# Hyperledger Mentorship Program : Project Plan - Iroha 1: Enhance query functionality by introducing supplementary, optional parameters to extend the versatility and customization capabilities of queries within the Hyperledger Iroha 1 blockchain.

Created by tomegru@gmail.com, last modified on Jan 22, 2024

## **Abstract**

In Hyperledger Iroha 1, while presenting a robust set of commands and queries, the absence of certain pertinent commands and queries has been identified. As Hyperledger Iroha 1 positions itself as a foundational element for banking systems due to its support for transactions and multiple currencies, the current implementation exhibits limited advanced filtering capabilities for transactions, a crucial requirement for robust banking systems. Presently, the process of filtering transactions involves retrieving a substantial number of them and subsequently applying filters within our codebase. This approach, however, proves to be resource-intensive for both C++ Iroha's node and the Python client application.

As part of an ongoing internship project, there is a strategic initiative to enhance the query functionality by introducing optional arguments:

what

which queries

extra information

reason

Incorporate an optional parameter, "title," to facilitate the inclusion of a title when executing the AddAssetQuantity operation. This addition enhances the flexibility and functionality of the process, allowing for the seamless inclusion of relevant titles as needed.

[Send Title in AddAssetQuantity](https://iroha.readthedocs.io/en/develop/develop/api/commands.html?highlight=addAssetQuantity#schema)

Not present in the WSV database.

Introduce an optional title parameter to the AddAssetQuantity, enhancing functionality within Iroha Core for improved message communication. Ensure corresponding handling capabilities in Iroha CLI for seamless integration.

Add optional argument, description[GetAccountAssetTransaction](https://iroha.readthedocs.io/en/develop/develop/api/queries.html#get-account-asset-transactions)Not present in the WSV database.

Sometimes we need to find transactions containing some text/words. It would be great if it would be possible to have multiple fragments in the query (e.g. when we want to find transactions in the bank, we use some words which we think would be there, but we are not sure what order).

Add optional argument, destinationAccount[GetAccountAssetTransaction](https://iroha.readthedocs.io/en/develop/develop/api/queries.html#get-account-asset-transactions)Not present in the WSV database.Sometimes we need to check all transactions sent to a specific account.Add optional argument, sourceAccount[GetAccountAssetTransaction](https://iroha.readthedocs.io/en/develop/develop/api/queries.html#get-account-asset-transactions)Not present in the WSV database.Sometimes we need to check all transactions sent from a specific account.

[GetAccountAssetTransaction](https://iroha.readthedocs.io/en/develop/develop/api/queries.html#get-account-asset-transactions) has a parameter account\_id, which returns all transactions for the account; it is currently impossible to specify only the destination/source/tx creator account, so it needs to be fixed.

Optionally - there is a [bug in Iroha 1](https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/issues/1122) when we use ordering. However, this internship is connected to querying databases, so the mentee may be able to fix it.

An optional description to commands as an alternative: `AddAssetQuantity` and `SubtractAssetQuantity can be implemented.`Currently the information on why it was added or subtracted is unavailable. It can be hard to get help, though: HL Iroha 1 is not under active development.

After applying changes to queries/commands, Iroha client libraries should also be updated (probably regenerate code from the protocol buffers).  
Client libraries:

- [Iroha-python library](https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha-python) as a client library
- Iroha-cpp ([embedded in Iroha core repository](https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha)) the core repository
- Iroha CLI as a command line interface
