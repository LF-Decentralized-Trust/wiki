# Hyperledger Mentorship Program : Project plan - Telecom Decentralized Identities Network (TDIDN) (2023)

Created by vipin rathi on Jul 03, 2023

**Abstract**

This mentorship aims to delve into the extensive range of use cases for Decentralized Identity (DID) within the telecommunications industry. The primary objective is to develop a comprehensive understanding of the potential applications of DID and its impact on telecom services. The mentorship further seeks to implement a Proof of Concept (POC) that establishes a unified Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) network, designed to provide substantial benefits to all stakeholders, including issuers, holders, and verifiers, within the realm of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI). Through this mentorship, participants will explore the transformative capabilities of DID in telecom, with the ultimate goal of fostering a more secure and efficient identity management system for all parties involved.
