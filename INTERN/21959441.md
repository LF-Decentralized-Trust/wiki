# Hyperledger Mentorship Program : Iroha 2: block squash (and migration) GUI

Created by Victor Gridnevsky, last modified by Min Yu on Apr 27, 2023

**Project Title**Block squash (and migration) GUI**Status**

UNSELECTED

**Primary Focus**

CODING 

# Description

The block squash and migration tool is expected to be used by many of the long-term users of an Iroha-based blockchain. It will allow the users to combine and process the Kura blocks Iroha uses.

In addition to implementing it, the intern will learn about the challenges of maintaining an API and an ABI across multiple versions of a single high-performance ledger.

# Additional Information

[Kura](https://hyperledger.github.io/iroha-2-docs/guide/glossary.html#kura-warehouse): the part of Iroha 2 that stores the blocks.

# Learning Objectives

The mentee shall:

- Learn Rust to the extent necessary to interact with the Iroha data model freely.
- Learn to uphold invariants that are not imposed in the library properly and learn how to correct corrupted data.
- Gain experience in ABI/API design.
- Learn the challenges associated with redundant distributed storage systems such as blockchains.

# Expected Outcome

A more user-friendly interface to a more feature-complete Iroha block squash tool.

# Relation to Hyperledger

This project will become a part of the tools accompanying Hyperledger Iroha.

# Mentee Skills

Understanding of:

- Rust [type](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/type-system.html) and [trait](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch10-02-traits.html) system.
- [Trait objects](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch17-02-trait-objects.html).
- [Enums](https://web.mit.edu/rust-lang_v1.25/arch/amd64_ubuntu1404/share/doc/rust/html/book/first-edition/enums.html)
- Understanding of contract-based programming.
- API / ABI stability.

Useful, but not required:

- Knowledge of `serde` &amp; Rust
- Understanding of Fintech mathematical operations and precision or scientific computation.
- Knowledge of WASM.
- Knowledge or willingness to learn Rust GUI tools like [Relm4](https://relm4.org/) or [Slint](https://slint-ui.com/).

# Future plans

After implementation, this GUI will become an actively supported part of the Iroha 2 project.
