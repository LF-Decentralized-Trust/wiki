# Hyperledger Mentorship Program : Project Plan - Improvements in HLF-Connector, Hardening the production readiness aspects

Created by Aditya Joshi, last modified by Subhranil Raha on Nov 25, 2023

# Abstract

The HLF-Connector is a project within the Hyperledger Labs community that provides a way to connect to and interact with Hyperledger Fabric Blockchain Networks from external applications using REST APIs &amp; Kafka-based Topics. This connector acts as a gateway between Fabric and non-Fabric applications, allowing external applications to securely read and write data to the Fabric blockchain through both synchronous and asynchronous modes of interaction. HLF-Connector provides a convenient and flexible way to integrate Fabric blockchain networks into external applications, allowing developers to build robust and secure decentralized applications that can interact with the Fabric network.Â
