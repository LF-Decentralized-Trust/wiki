Created by Donald Stewart, last modified on Jul 21, 2020

MonthMilestonesJuly

- Week of July 20: Exploration + Create a chain code which allows writing arbitrary key value pairs, and reading them
- Week of July 27: Write a client-side program that interacts with the chain code and writes and arbitrary key-value pair, and reads the value of arbitrary key. In Node.js and Go.
