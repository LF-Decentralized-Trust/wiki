# Description

Idemix is a cryptographic protocol suite, which provides strong authentication as well as privacy-preserving features such as **anonymity**, the ability to transact without revealing the identity of the transactor, and **unlinkability**, the ability of a single identity to send multiple transactions without revealing that the transactions were sent by the same identity. More details here - [https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.2/idemix.html](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.2/idemix.html)

Current JavaSDK doesn't support to store Idemix credentials in Hyperledger Fabric Wallet. Objective of this mentorship program to support wallet to store idimix identities.

Here is Some fabric Java SDK changes required to complete this mentorship program.

1. Idemix identity provider defined, similar to [https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-gateway-java/blob/main/src/main/java/org/hyperledger/fabric/gateway/impl/identity/X509IdentityProvider.java](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-gateway-java/blob/main/src/main/java/org/hyperledger/fabric/gateway/impl/identity/X509IdentityProvider.java)

<!--THE END-->

1. Idemix identity type defined, similar to: [https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-gateway-java/blob/main/src/main/java/org/hyperledger/fabric/gateway/impl/identity/X509IdentityImpl.java](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-gateway-java/blob/main/src/main/java/org/hyperledger/fabric/gateway/impl/identity/X509IdentityImpl.java)

Alternatively, if you are (or can) use Fabric v2.4, the new Fabric Gateway client API, while not currently including an Idemix implementation out-of-the-box, would allow you to plug in one without modifying the client API by just supplying:

1. Idemix Identity representation (just MSD IP and credential bytes): [https://hyperledger.github.io/fabric-gateway/main/api/java/org/hyperledger/fabric/client/identity/Identity.html](https://hyperledger.github.io/fabric-gateway/main/api/java/org/hyperledger/fabric/client/identity/Identity.html)

<!--THE END-->

1. Idemix signing function: [https://hyperledger.github.io/fabric-gateway/main/api/java/org/hyperledger/fabric/client/identity/Signer.html](https://hyperledger.github.io/fabric-gateway/main/api/java/org/hyperledger/fabric/client/identity/Signer.html)
