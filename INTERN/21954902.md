# Hyperledger Mentorship Program : Iroha 2: FFI client library bindings

Created by Victor Gridnevsky, last modified by Min Yu on Dec 18, 2023

**Project Title**Iroha 2 FFI client library bindings**Status**

COMPLETED

**Primary Focus**

CODING

# Description

Currently, the Hyperledger Iroha v2 clients are linked statically or via a sophisticated code generation process that is both brittle and necessitates an inordinate amount of work for each ABI-breaking change to the Hyperledger Iroha v2 core library.

Instead, we plan to create a shared C-ABI-based dynamically linked library that will be used by all clients and SDKs and the reference implementation of a Rust client: `iroha_client_cli`.

# Additional Information

Since this project would be a part of Iroha core code, there are no links to add, but the questions are welcome.

# Learning Objectives

The mentee shall learn about

- The C-ABI
- The Rust facilities for dynamic linkage
- `unsafe` programming in Rust
- low-level structure representations
- Undefined behaviour

# Expected Outcome

This project would enable the dynamic linking of SDK, resulting in an improved SDK ecosystem and better support for existing languages like Python or TypeScript.

# Relation to Hyperledger

Iroha SDK is a part of Hyperledger Iroha 2 project.

# Mentee Skills

- Basic knowledge of Rust

Useful knowledge or willingness to learn:

- FFI
- C-bindings generators
- The ideas of ABI stability
- The basics of code refactoring

# Future plans

Enhanced FFI client bindings will be used in many Iroha 2 SDKs as an actively supported part of it.
