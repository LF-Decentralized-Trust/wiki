# Hyperledger Mentorship Program : Project Plan - Create Kubernetes operators for Hyperledger Besu

Created by Sumaid Syed, last modified on Aug 26, 2020

## Goals

Hyperledger Besu is an Ethereum client written in Java. Operators are a method of packaging, deploying, and managing a Kubernetes or an OpenShift application. This project aims to design, build, and test operators for Project Besu. The code to this will then become part of the Besu project and added to the code repository.

## Timeline

A tentative schedule of my plan is as follows.
