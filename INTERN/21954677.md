# Hyperledger Mentorship Program : Secure DID Registry on Github/Gitlab for Hyperledger Frameworks

Created by Vinod Panicker, last modified by Min Yu on Dec 01, 2020

**Title** Utility to create a Secure DID Registry on Github/Gitlab for Hyperledger Frameworks **Status**

COMPLETED

**Difficulty**

MEDIUM  

# Description

Develop a command line utility that can create a secure [DID](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/) Registry on Github or a Gitlab .

On the Bash shell this utility will enable commands that makes use of Github or Gitlab API for doing basic CRUD operations on  a  GIT repository based DID Registry.

# Additional Information

This is a git repository based [DID registry](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#did-registries). The utility will also have commands to manage git based DID Registry

(i.e create, reset , revoke, resolve, add , remove  ( Repositories, DID, DID Docs , Verifiable Organizations and Trusted Member.)). 

# Learning Objectives

The Participant learn how to interface with various Hyperledger Frameworks and also learn how to automate the creation of Organization specific DID Registries on Github or Gitlab.

# Expected Outcome

Scripts to create a DID registry structure and on boarding the trusted team with necessary ACL set for working with the git repository . This should be enabled with an API layer through which the interaction with DID registry can be enabled and integrated with other platforms

# Relation to Hyperledger

Github/Gitlab based DID registries  that can be used by Hyperledger Indy, Hyperledger Aries or any other Hyperledger Framework that needs to interact with DID Registries 

# Education Level

Graduate or Masters students preferred. Please do take a look at the skills.

# Skills

Knowledge of Git , GitHub or Gitlab  ,shell-scripting and python would be required.

# Future plans

The plan is to further enhance this as an open source utility and add more capabilities required to manage an full featured DID Registry on Github.

# Preferred Hours and Length of Internship

Part-time (20 hours a week for 24 weeks starting in summer and ending in fall)
