# Hyperledger Mentorship Program : Project Plan for DIDMan-Based Openwallet for Indy Ecosystem

Created by Arindam Dutta, last modified on Jul 01, 2024

## **Abstract**

This project focuses on bringing the functionalities of the DIDMan Registry Manager to the Bifold wallet. The Bifold wallet will then be able to manage Decentralized Identifier Registries (DID Registries) on GitHub in similar ways. This includes creating new DID Registries for organizations, similar to how organizations can develop repositories on GitHub. Additionally, users can manage access permissions for members within their organization, allowing granular control over who can access a specific DID Registry. Finally, the Bifold wallet will offer a set of tools to manage DID documents stored within the DID Registry. These tools allow users to add new DIDs, update existing ones, and revoke access.
