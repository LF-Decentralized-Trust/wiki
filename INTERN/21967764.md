# Hyperledger Mentorship Program : Project plan - An object-key-value mapper for Hyperledger Fabric (2023)

Created by Attila Klenik, last modified by Vinayak Raj Ranjan on Apr 02, 2024

# Short description

The goal of the mentorship is to design and implement an object-key-value mapper for Fabric chaincodes with the following functionality:

- Generating key-value storage models from UML ledger data models.
- Application of storage strategies during the mapping.
- Generating a chaincode-internal Java data access/persistence layer, “parameterized” by the storage model.
- Demonstration on a representative example (e.g., our earlier work on faithfully implementing TPC-C to Fabric).
- (If we have time): declaring OCL (Object Constraint Language) constraints on the models and enforcing them in the data access layer.
