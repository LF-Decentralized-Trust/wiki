# Hyperledger Mentorship Program : Project Plan: The Use of NLP and DLT to Enable the Digitalization of Telecom Roaming Agreements

Created by Ahmad Sghaier Omar, last modified on Nov 14, 2021

## **Abstract**

The project looks at how to transform the telecom roaming agreements documents and the process of drafting and negotiation into a digitalized version:

1. Build a library that will capture the different variations and variables that constructs a telecom roaming agreement.
2. Build a PoC based on a set of smart contracts that will automate the process of drafting and negotation

## **Project Deliverables**

- A series of medium articles explaining the main project vision, main concepts, and the proposed design approach.
