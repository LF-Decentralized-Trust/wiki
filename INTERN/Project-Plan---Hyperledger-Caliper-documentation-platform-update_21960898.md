# Hyperledger Mentorship Program : Project Plan - Hyperledger Caliper documentation platform update

Created by Pratiksha Sankhe, last modified on Jul 29, 2024

## **Abstract**

The goal of this project is to enhance the Hyperledger Caliper documentation by aligning it with user needs and community feedback. This includes transitioning to a standardized template used across Hyperledger projects to improve accessibility, consistency, and comprehensiveness. The focus will be on refining content to cover all aspects of Caliper thoroughly, from installation and configuration to usage and troubleshooting, ensuring it remains current and accurate. These improvements aim to boost usability, adoption, and overall user satisfaction.
