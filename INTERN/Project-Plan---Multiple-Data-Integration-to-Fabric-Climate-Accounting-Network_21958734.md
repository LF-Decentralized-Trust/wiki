# Hyperledger Mentorship Program : Project Plan - Multiple Data Integration to Fabric Climate Accounting Network

Created by Bertrand WILLIAMSRIOUX, last modified by Achintya Kumar on Aug 08, 2022

## **Abstract**

Implement client side security for the Climate SIG's Hyperledger Fabric application, so that transactions could be signed using Metamask through TrustId.

## **Explanation**

The [Hyperledger Labs blockchain-carbon-accounting project](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/blockchain-carbon-accounting) includes a Hyperledger Fabric network for recording the carbon and Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions that cause climate change.  Since there are many activities that cause such emissions, the network is designed to accept data from multiple sources of measurements.  In this project, we will demonstrate integrations from measurement sources with blockchain networks by integrating the ThoughtWorks cloud computing emissions calculator, the NREL OpenPath mobile application, and other web- and mobile-based API's sources to turn instrumented readings into emissions measurements.   It will leverage previous projects involving Hyperledger Cactus, Vault security engines, and client security for Hyperledger Fabric.

See [Transportation Emissions](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/CASIG/Transportation+Emissions), [Reducing Methane Leakage and Flaring through Supply Chain Tokens](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/events/Reducing+Methane+Leakage+and+Flaring+through+Supply+Chain+Tokens), and the [2021-05-10 Peer Programming Call](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/CASIG/2021-05-10+Peer+Programming+Call) for the Thoughtworks Cloud Computing Carbon Footprint Calculator.

Status

**June 1 - 14**

Mentee intro, intro blockchain carbon accounting project and deploying fabric emissions data channel

Completed***June 13 - 24***

Look into modifying chaincode to call emission records from external database (postgres). Learn how to setup API calls from Fabric. Look at work done on the Blockchain Carbon Accounting project in Fall of 2020 making API call to DynamoDB from emissionscontract chaincode.

Completed

**June 27 - July 8**

Work on setting up the postgres db and emissionscontract modificationCompleted**July 11 - July 22**Modify the chaincode and proper documentation of oracle api as well as proof of working with mock data

Completed
