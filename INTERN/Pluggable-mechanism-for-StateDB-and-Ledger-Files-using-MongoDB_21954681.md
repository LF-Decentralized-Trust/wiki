# Hyperledger Mentorship Program : Pluggable mechanism for StateDB and Ledger Files using MongoDB

**Title**Pluggable mechanism for StateDB and Ledger Files using MongoDB**Status**

CANCELLED

**Difficulty**

 MEDIUM  

# Description

Presently, Fabric stores StateDB in CouchDB or goLevelDB. Create a pluggable mechanism for StateDB using MongoDB. Also, create a pluggable mechanism for storing ledger files in a database such as MongoDB. This mechanism will not only help make data stores truly pluggable, but also make easy to analyze Hyperledger Fabric data natively using MongoDB. Analzying Fabric data (e.g., for provenance) is currently a huge challenge and requires creation/setup of a separate infrastructure.

# Additional Information

- See
  
  Error rendering macro 'jira' : null
- See last year's project on [blockchain-analyzer](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/blockchain-analyzer) which retrieves and stores the Fabric data in a separate data store for better analysis. This approach requires a separate copy of Fabric data, which creates a storage and operational overhead.
  

# Learning Objectives

- Hyperledger Fabric code
- Go, Docker
- Weekly 1-1 meetings, Slack
- Code as lab
- Incorporate code in mainline Fabric

# Expected Outcome

- Hyperledger Lab demonstrating the feasibility
  
- Incorporating the code into mainline Fabric code

# Relation to Hyperledger

Hyperledger Fabric

# Education Level

Undergraduate or graduate

# Skills

- Go, Docker
- Familiarity with Fabric (creating a network or starting a dev environment) is a plus

# Future plans

Incorporate the project source code into Hyperledger Fabric

# Preferred Hours and Length of Internship

40 hours during summer

# Mentor(s) Names and Contact Info
