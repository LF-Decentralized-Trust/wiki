# Hyperledger Mentorship Program : Learning Tokens

Created by Alfonso Govela, last modified by Min Yu on Dec 19, 2022

**Project Title**Learning Tokens**Status**

COMPLETED

**Difficulty**

MEDIUM  

# Description

We propose to use the composable Interwork Alliance Token Taxonomy Framework (IWA TTF) to produce a **Learning Token** that recognizes, registers, and rewards community engagement in teaching and learning experiences, certifying, at the same time, the acquisition of skills and competencies.

Communities that agree upon valuable behaviors can turn those behaviors into unique token representations of their value and set up clear rules for its creation and supply, able to resist modification or tampering, and, most important, capable of being transferred per-to-peer. Our Learning Token is proof of behaviors that benefit learning communities, individual members, and collectivity.

With IWA TTF, we shall define common token concepts with a clear understanding of our requirements. We shall specify properties for particular behaviors. We shall link their base Token Classification Hierarchy with our Taxonomy of DLT / Blockchain Educational Opportunities as initial meta-data for standard artifacts and control message descriptions.

# Learning Objectives

Understand the process of tokenization for collective learning. Produce a Learning Token to register, recognize, and reward engagement in the creation of collective knowledge. Learn to use the Interwork Alliance Token Taxonomy Framework. Contribute to NEFERTI, our NFT Lab at Hyperledger. Learn to define a business case and economic model for tokenization. Write business definition for tokens. Identify base token types, behaviors, and properties. Reuse existing artifacts from GitHub repositories (Hyperledger eThaler, NEFERTI, IWA). Contribute new artifacts that are platform-agnostic and implementation neutral. Identify certification bodies, and get their comments on your token definition. Empower a Learning Community for DLT / Blockchain Educational Opportunities.

# Future plans

In 2021, we began our journey with Hyperledger Mentorship Program with Global Scouting for DLT / Blockchain Educational Opportunities. For three summer months, we built a preliminary Directory of Educational Opportunities, assembled a Taxonomy of Content and Places of Learning, and represented our Ontology in a Knowledge Graph to help navigate the universe of educational opportunities.

In that first phase, we missed reaching a large crowd of people, places, and resources, and we did not spark a community of learners. We learned our hard lessons. Goals take time to mature, well over one summer. It is better to extend the Mentorship period to six months of half-time engagement of Mentees. Direct questionnaires to our Hyperledger Community had little results. We need alliances with institutions with powerful follow-up traction.

Today, for our second phase, we have two tracks in mind.

1. An agreement with GBBA to collaborate on their Global Standard Mapping Initiative, GSMI 3.0, at key area number four: *university courses and degree programs mapping*. Voluntary mentees from Universidad Tecnólogica Nacional, UTN, at Cordoba, Argentina shall populate our Knowledge Graph with programs listed in the GBBC-GSMI Map of 389 Universities and showcase its navigation potential.
2. With your support, Hyperledger Mentorship Program 2022, we would like to engage a thriving community with our Learning Token, both as NFT and FT.

In the future, for Phase 3, Linux Foundation could lead a coalition of universities to lay the foundations for a peer-review system of accreditation to certify a top-quality DLT / Blockchain, like the service provided by the Global Business Education Network, AACSB.
