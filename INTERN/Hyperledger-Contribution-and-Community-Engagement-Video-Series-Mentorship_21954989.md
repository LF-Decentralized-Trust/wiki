**Primary Focus**

DOCUMENTATION  

# Description

This proposal aims to not only update and expand the instructional content and video resources available to the Hyperledger community but also to foster a mentorship relationship that can contribute to the mentee's professional growth and the overall vibrancy of the Hyperledger ecosystem.

# Learning Objectives

The mentor and mentee will collaborate to create a series of instructional videos covering a range of topics, including:

- Updating the videos on the Hyperledger Participate page ([https://www.hyperledger.org/participate/coding](https://www.hyperledger.org/participate/coding))
- Understanding the contribution process, including how to submit issues, pull requests, and review processes.
- Overview of the Hyperledger community structure, including Special Interest Groups (SIGs), Working Groups, and how to get involved.
- Deep dives into specific Hyperledger projects, highlighting key features and contribution opportunities.
- Best practices for successful community engagement and contribution.
- Setting up a development environment for Hyperledger projects.

# Expected Outcome and Deliverables

- A comprehensive and updated series of videos hosted on the Hyperledger "Participate" page ([https://www.hyperledger.org/participate/coding](https://www.hyperledger.org/participate/coding)), significantly enhancing the resources available to new and existing community members.
- Increased engagement and contributions from the community, facilitated by clearer guidance and support via updated community driven videos.
- Strengthened connections within the Hyperledger community, as the updated video series should encourage collaboration and involvement.

# Relation to Hyperledger and Impact on the community

- The outcome of this mentorship will align the new video content with community needs and Hyperledger standards.
- The mentee will engage with the Hyperledger community to solicit feedback and suggestions for new video topics and improvements to existing content.
- The mentee will ensure the video series is accessible to a wide audience, including considerations for closed captions and clear visual aids to increase Hyperledger community involvement.
- The current videos on the Participate page ([https://www.hyperledger.org/participate/coding](https://www.hyperledger.org/participate/coding)) on the Hyperledger website are several years old and incomplete and it would be beneficial to the community to have these resources updated.

# Recommended Skills

- Engagement with any of the Hyperledger communities and/or various projects or other open source experience.
- Experience with video production and any other relevant technical expertise.
- Any type of content management system (CMS) or web development experience, including the use of an LFID for editing website content.
- The ability to write a short proposal outlining their vision for the video series, including potential topics and a preliminary content outline.
- Any previous work samples that demonstrate their ability to produce educational or instructional video content.
