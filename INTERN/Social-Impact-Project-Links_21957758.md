General project information:  
Project name: The Giving Chain  
Website / wiki: [http://www.thegivingchain.org](http://www.thegivingchain.org)  
Project description  
Abstract: Can you explain the whole project and its expected outcome(s).:  
The Giving Chain is a 2019 Blockchain social impact project that as a Proof-of-Concept  
project reimagined Charity Giving and disaster relief. By leveraging the Hyperledger  
Sawtooth Supply Chain Blockchain, we created a decentralized system to distribute charity  
items. The D2R application (Donor to Recipients) is comprised of three interfaces that  
alert and track donations through the system. The 2019 project delivered 48 "Giving  
Bags" to homeless Veteran and 650 pounds of Food to a local foodbank. We are looking to  
build the infrastructure for a Minimal Viable product and build a community that can  
implement this solution.  
\*Have you been involved with projects or organisations relevant to this project  
before? And if so, can you tell us a bit about your contributions?:  
As the Chair of the Hyperledger Learning Materials Development Working Group ( 3 years), I  
have curated an open-source Resource Library for materials the community has developed. As  
a member of the Hyperledger Technical Steering Committee (1 Year) , I have been working to  
guide the Hyperledger direction. Ledger Academy (5 years) develops curriculum to educate  
the community on blockchain technologies. Ledger Academy and Hyperledger sponsored the  
Giving Chain project in 2019 and are teaming up again for the Giving Chain 2021 party.  
\*Requested support:  
Requested amount:  
50,0000.  
Explain what the requested budget will be used for? Does the project have other  
funding sources, both past and present? (If you want, you can in addition attach  
a budget at the end of the form):  
The project is sponsored through the Hyperledger mentorship program which consists of a  
part time intern from hyperledger, access to hyperledger developers and a group of  
dedicated volunteers. Funding is needed to develop the interfaces, build the blockchain  
solution and introduce the solution into communities in need.  
Compare your own project with existing or historical efforts.:  
The American Red Cross and other disaster relief programs deliver similar solutions, but  
are centralized. The decentralized nature of blockchain based solutions give a community  
an immutable technical structure for transactional exchanges that reimagine local charity  
giving and disaster relief programs. A simple smart phone to download the R2D application  
is all that is necessary for communities to harness the generosity of its members. This  
solution offers aid to its most vulnerable members in a dignified manner.  
\*What are significant technical challenges you expect to solve during the  
project, if any?:  
With all track and trace blockchains, identifying the donations and tracking the transfer  
is a challenge as the correct data points must be collected and traced. User interfaces  
must be intuitive and provide users with a seamless experience.  
Describe the ecosystem of the project, and how you will engage with relevant  
actors and promote the outcomes?:  
The cooperation from Hyperledger along with the support of Ledger Academy, we will engage  
in weekly meetups to keep the project on track. Associations need to be developed with  
need based organizations. All project work is open-source and developers are encouraged to  
contribute and get involved.
