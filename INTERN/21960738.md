# Hyperledger Mentorship Program : Solang: LALRPOP Parser, Intermediate Code Representation (ICR), and Code Optimization

Created by Ramaguru Radhakrishnan, last modified by Min Yu on Jun 07, 2024

**Project Title**Solang: LALRPOP Parser, Intermediate Code Representation (ICR), and Code Optimization**Status**

IN PROGRESS

**Primary Focus**

RESEARCH DOCUMENTATION

# Description

Our goal is to provide comprehensive documentation of the **LALRPOP Parser**, **Intermediate Code Representation** **(ICR)**, and **Code Optimization** techniques utilized in [Solang](https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/solang).

**Solang** is a compiler for the Solidity Programming language, targeting the **Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)** and **WebAssembly (Wasm)** platforms. The documentation will encompass a detailed exploration of the parser's functionality, the structure of the intermediate representation, and various code optimization strategies employed within Solang.

Additionally, we aim to propose improvements and enhancements to these components based on the latest research and advancements in compiler construction. Specifically, we will focus on suggesting advancements in error handling techniques, enhancing the ICR, and introducing more effective code optimization techniques.
