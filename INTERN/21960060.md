# Hyperledger Mentorship Program : Project Plan - Aries VCX Next-gen Mobile Wrapper (UniFFI)

Created by George Mulhearn, last modified on Dec 08, 2023

# Abstract

Aries-VCX is a collection of Rust crates which provide APIs for stepping through Hyperledger Aries Protocols. Previously, Aries-vcx has provided it's functionality to mobile (android and ios) consumers via a wrapper layer known as libvcx. Libvcx wraps over aries\_vcx functionality and creates C-callable FFI bindings, and provides Java and Objective-C bindings for calling those bindings from mobile ecosystems. Overtime, manually maintain libvcx has become quite a chore, and does not leverage new FFI tech which is now available. The goal of this mentorship project, is to create new mobile bindings using the UniFFI tool, which from initial prototyping has shown a lot promise.

## Mentors

*Patrik Stas, Discord: Patrik Stas#7722, Absa Group  
Bogdan Mircea, Discord: bobozaur#5997, Absa Group

# Deliverables

- Create Android binary + bindings compilation scripts for the existing UniFFI prototype in aries-vcx: [https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-vcx/tree/main/uniffi\_aries\_vcx](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-vcx/tree/main/uniffi_aries_vcx)
  
- Bootstrap sample android demo application, which consumes the existing prototype's bindings and binaries
- Create bindings for all `Connection`  APIs and update sample app accordingly
- Create bindings for all `Holder`  APIs and update sample app accordingly
- Update existing prototype to use newer aries\_vcx functionality (switch from vdrtools profile to modular\_libs profile)

## Bonus Deliverables

- Create CI for compiling and packaging an Android SDK deliverable with aries\_vcx and mediator client functionality
  
- Consider async API optimizations (how can be improve on the existing `run_blocking`  approach.. UniFFI may have support for this later in the timeline!)
- Create CI for compiling and packaging an iOS SDK deliverable with aries\_vcx and mediator client functionality

## **Milestones**

**Eval 1:**

- Comfortable with aries-vcx and UniFFI tool
- Script for building uniffi\_aries\_vcx android consumables developed
- Sample app bootstrapped and consuming/demonstrating uniffi\_aries\_vcx bindings

**Eval 2:**

- Connection APIs wrapped in UniFFI
- Sample app updated to demonstrate Connection APIs

**Eval 3:**

- Holder APIs wrapped in UniFFI

**Eval 4:**

- Migrate to modular libs stack (credx, indy-vdr)
- Sample app updated to support Holder flow (receive a credential)

## **Timeline**

DatesTasks/Plan

Status

**Jun 12 - Jun 26**

Mentee intro with the mentor.

On-boarding:

- understand aries vcx project/s
  
- Get aries-vcx integration tests working to confirm development environment
- plan out the scope and tasks for the UniFFI project
- complete UniFFI tutorials
- build rust sample project for Android architectures

✅**Jun 27 - Jul 10**

- Manually build the existing uniffi\_aries\_vcx project for android
- Create a convenience script for compiling uniffi\_aries\_vcx project for android
- Expand the script to generate UniFFI bindings for uniffi\_aries\_vcx
  
  - [https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-vcx/pull/896](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-vcx/pull/896) (moved to PR with sample app)

✅

**Jul 11 - Jul 24**

- Bootstrap android sample app which consumes bindings generated by script mentioned above - demonstrate app to mentors (e.g. a simple button that calls into an existing uniffi method).
  
  - consider how to best automate/optimize personal development flow from creating new feature to testing in app
  - [https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-vcx/pull/896](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-vcx/pull/896)
- update uniffi\_aries\_vcx to use modular-libs instead of vdrtools
  
  - Not an appropriate time for this

✅**Jul 25 - Aug 7 (Jul 28 eval)**

- Complete `Connection`  API uniffi bindings
- Update sample app to create profile

✅**Aug 8 - Aug 21**

- Update sample app to scan invitation

✅

**Aug 22 - Sep 4 (Sept 1 eval)**

- Update sample app to send request

✅**Sep 5 - Sep 18**

- Update sample app to wait for response and complete connection protocol
  
  - [https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-vcx/pull/970/files](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-vcx/pull/970/files)

✅**Sep 19 - Oct 2**

- Work on Holder API bindings

✅**Oct 3 - Oct 16 (Oct 13 eval)**

- complete Holder API bindings
  
  - [PR](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-vcx/pull/1014)
- start/plan work on sample app holder flow (receive a cred)

✅**Oct 16 - Oct 30**

- Migrate to modular libs stack (credx, indy-vdr) and ensure successful compilation still
  
  - [https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-vcx/pull/1030](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-vcx/pull/1030)
- continue work on sample app holder flow (receive a cred)
