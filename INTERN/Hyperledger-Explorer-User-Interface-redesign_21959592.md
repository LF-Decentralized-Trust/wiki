Created by Jayasimha Prasad, last modified by Min Yu on Jan 31, 2024

**Project Title**Redesign the user experience of hyperledger explorer project to create a unified interface for exploring blockchain ledger across all the hyperledger blockchain projects**Status**

COMPLETED

**Primary Focus**

DESIGN DOCUMENTATION  RESEARCH

# Description

Blockchain Explorer provides a graphical user interface to explore blocks, transactions, nodes, channels, chaincodes in a blockchain network.  The goal of this project is to redesign the  user interface of hyperledger explorer project to provide an easy as seamless experience for the user. The goal is to make Blockchain explorer as the common explorer tool for all the hyperledger DLT projects.

# Additional Information

1. [Hyperledger Explorer – Hyperledger Foundation](https://www.hyperledger.org/use/explorer) - Overview of Blockchain-Explorer
2. [hyperledger-labs/blockchain-explorer (github.com)](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/blockchain-explorer) - Explorer Repository
3. [Hyperledger Explorer documentation](https://blockchain-explorer.readthedocs.io/en/main/) - Explorer documentation

# Learning Objectives

1. To implement all the user research , analysis and design techniques to design a very compelling user experience for hyperledger fabric.
2. Gain an indepth understanding of Hyperledger DLT projects.
3. Developer user experience and user interface design skills.

# Expected Outcome

User flows , wireframes, style guide and high fidelity mockup of the new user interface design for hyperledger explorer

# Relation to Hyperledger
