Report on **FireFly CODING  Report   
[![](https://wiki.hyperledger.org/rest/documentConversion/latest/conversion/thumbnail/56723823/1)](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/18721963/FF-Setup.pdf?version=1&modificationDate=1629736469000&api=v2) PDF  
Here’s what I did just now:  
1\) created a stack  
2\) ran it  
3\) it generated a web UI for each member I specified and I see dashboards on local ports  
I just set up the blockchain in my local is all that happened.  
It’s a good first step and happy to discuss, but of course still a lot more work to be done :)

I wanted to also share a quick setup doc I put together. I have attached it to this mail and will also post to our team page.  
I have a feeling anyone that had issues setting up the cli was missing configuration of the go path.**

From Mona

I can create a rough draft in word in the meantime, but would need to know the platform to use their editing tools.   
Of course, I would also share the rough draft and allow you guys to edit before posting anything.

I have a couple ideas I wanted to run by you guys as well from both technical and marketing perspective. 

One idea: [https://www.thegivingblock.com/](https://www.thegivingblock.com/)  
This platform on boards charities and accepts donations in different cryptocurrencies to that organization wallet address.  
(Their team assists the nonprofits and works with them for setting up wallet, etc)

Since investors are keen on reducing their tax burden for crypto gains this might help with donations.   
Here I also have a link to their contact us/book a demo page: [https://www.thegivingblock.com/nonprofits](https://www.thegivingblock.com/nonprofits)  
They may also help with marketing promotion since we would be on their platform, absolutely worth bringing up.  
If you'd like I am also happy to assist with getting in touch with them if you guys decide this is a good direction.

Another Aside:   
This is good to know from technical perspective.   
I started looking at Firefly over the weekend. Firefly has IPFS (interplanetary file system) integrations.   
I have passion and sufficient understanding of Web 3.0 tech since blockchain/crypto is my favorite area of tech.   
The IPFS project comprises the data layer of Web 3.0. If you'd like we can highlight this fact as technical promotion/marketing promotion since Web 3.0 is an interesting topic.   
Blockchain Social Impact Project + Web3.0 integrations?? Sounds nice :) 

This is just all food for thought, my intentions are simply just to help as much as I can within my capacity and availability.  
For me, to see others benefit from this project is the biggest reward :)

Kind Regards,  
Mona

We are interested in having a discussion with the sawtooth group for any and all advise. Just a heads up , we were thinking of joining your call next Friday, any chance we could get a few minutes on the agenda? Bobbi

#### **A Call for Entries**

##### The GBA will be hosting a digital (online) **Art Show** during **[Government Blockchain Week](https://www.gbaglobal.org/event/2021gbw/),** Sept 27- Oct 2, 2021

### ‘What I Hope to See Blockchain Achieve in My Lifetime’

Do you have ideas of flying delivery robots, smart sneakers, programmable flowers, or trips into space? Why not express them in an artistic way and submit your image?

This show is not just for conventional artists. Blockchain innovators have ideas that need to be expressed beyond words. Draw, paint, AI-generate, sodder, or build your ideas for all to see. A digital image of your work will be viewed by hundreds of leaders from around the world, and all attendees to Government Blockchain Week will be able to vote on the winners. Cash prizes for Best In Show, Second Place, and Third Place will be awarded from the stage of the US Capitol on Friday, October 1, 2021.

#### Submissions will be judged on 5 categories:

#### 1) Creativity/Originality. How insightful and innovative is this idea? 2) Practicality. Could this idea work? Is it even remotely possible? 3) Helpful/ Humanity. Does this idea help anyone? Who? How? 4) Involvement. Is the artist involved in the deployment of this project? How? To what extent? 5) Visual appeal. How pleasing is the image to behold?

Please describe in the entry form how your art answers numbers 3 and 4.

This art show has a dual purpose. We hope to utilize a blockchain voting app, built by the [GBA Voting Working Group](https://www.gbaglobal.org/docs/voting-working-group-2020-roadmap/), to allow all participants of Government Blockchain Week to judge the show. Winners will be chosen from each of the categories, and each of the 5 winners will receive recognition and an award from the stage on October 1 at the US Capitol. We are in process of creating **NFT**s out of selected pieces that will be for sale at this event. Artists will receive 75 percent of any NFT sales of their work. You do not want to miss out!

**Weekly checkpoints**

Weekly checkpoints are meant to guide you to **think through your own solution prototype**, **stay on track**, and ultimately **formulate your own Blockchain  / White Paper / Projects**. 

Each week is designed to address a particular set of questions. 

**Week 1: Impact Opportunity**

- - Define Project and team members.
  - Select your challenge requirements.
  - Define the scope of problem you are addressing.
  - Why is blockchain needed to solve this problem?
  - What is the size of the market? What demographics will you serve? Which industries will you impact? Any concurrent trends?
  - What are some current solutions to the problem you identified? Do they work effectively?
  - Who are the stakeholders involved? How are they thinking/feeling/acting currently?
  - What are the geopolitical, cultural-social-economic factors that must be taken into consideration? What are some nuances and complexities that must be addressed?

End of Week Presentation 

**Week 2: Business Model Validation**

- Who are your clients/users? Sketch out the persona of your user.
- What are their pain points? How does your solution solve them? Indicate your unique value proposition.
- Does your solution depend on context? Can it be scaled?
- What is your go-to-market strategy? Who can you partner with?
- How will your product generate revenue / benefit ? Will it be financially sustainable in the long-term?
- What are the implicit and explicit assumptions being made in your business and financial model (user-profiles, partnerships, costs, etc.)? How do you plan on validating them?
- What is the vision for your product? Can it significantly change the current state?

End of Week Presentation

**Week 3: Technical Architecture**

- - **Marketing Tests:** Landing Page, Explainer Video, Ad Campaign, A/B Tests, Crowdfunding
  - **Product Tests:** Sketches, Wireframes, Mockups, Interactive, Prototype, Wizard of Oz, Concierge, Live Product
- Outline a development roadmap with a realistic timeline that takes into account your product vision, market readiness, team capabilities, functional upgrades and testing plans. What are your goals for each phase? How will your product evolve? Will you integrate other technologies?

End of Week Presentation 

**Week 4: Impact Measurement**

- What is the impact goal of your solution? How do you ensure to capture needs of those who are traditionally underserved within your category?
- What are the key indicators that capture your impact goal? Are they compatible with globally recognized standards (e.g. IRIS, SROI, PPI)? Do you have impact measures to add to create a more equal and inclusive solution?
- What variables and data points do you need to collect? What are the tools and processes to collect those data? What are some obstacles you may face on the ground? Infrastructure issues, measurement techniquest, etc.
- How do you collect feedback? How do you improve your measurement?

End of Week Presentation

**Week 5: Code**

- Prototype your solution in some manner. Examples include:
- - Working code
  - Analog prototype / Mock-ups
  - Tech Stack and Wireframes
  - Create blockchain and implement.

End of Week Presentation

**Week 6: Final Submissions Due**

*Response*

Bobbi

Added emails from older project for welcome letter and survey.  **Do you think we should send just the survey with a short blurb about the project ( maybe link to website if ready) to meetup groups and linkedin connections to see in there is an interest from folks outside Hyperledger in joining?**

Emailed Jim for information for Welcome letter

Reviewed Survey:  looks great, **Do you think we should ask where they see themselves contributing to get folk hooked into  project or is it too soon?**

Hardik 

[https://forms.gle/HvxtPzrvvnBp19iF7](https://forms.gle/HvxtPzrvvnBp19iF7) Take a look, What else should I add? Or are there are any specific changes that you may like. .

### 6/7 Email Thread

Hardik,  I have  a few suggestions on your recent email.

> - I'm planning on creating a page under [https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/LMDWG/Mentorship+Programs](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/LMDWG/Mentorship+Programs) where I will keep all the notes and the achievements that we have made towards the goals. 
>   
>   - - I created a page under the LMDWG where we can keep the project information, lets keep the mentorship program section about your work, assessment and project goals.
>     - [https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/LMDWG/The+Giving+Chain+2021](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/LMDWG/The+Giving+Chain+2021)
> - For the **mailing list,** I will ask around my friend circle to see if I can get a few people to join us. Also, shall I ask other mentees too? What do you think?
>   
>   - - I think for our welcome email you should get as many names as possible, go through the page for the mentee emails and the old project information for prior  members email and please add them to the wiki page [https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/LMDWG/The+Giving+Chain+2021](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/LMDWG/The+Giving+Chain+2021)
> - I totally under the importance of the **invitation email,** I will try my level best to create a compelling email body. Will be ready by our next project call!
>   
>   - - I have started the welcome email and put my work on the letter on the wiki, Jim and Hardik please edit and fill in what you want to say to potential members to inspire them to get involved. We can go over it at the next LMDWG call and then send it to everyone on our email list.
> - For the form, I have a suggestion. I think that giving choices for the meeting time would be much better than asking the group for their best time. It will create less confusion. For example 
>   
>   - - Hardik that is exactly the way we need to whittle down to get the most convenient time for everyone. I started a Google Doc for us to edit. Jim,   please edit for information you think will be relevant to have from potential team members. 
>       
>       [https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1J1DBvB-oXhugVDflI3QC77ggDhqFn2pLbOXQHy2CCvg/edit](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1J1DBvB-oXhugVDflI3QC77ggDhqFn2pLbOXQHy2CCvg/edit)
>       
>       and Hardik please work on the overall form and relevant information you would want from the team.  We will review at the next LMDWG call.
> 
> <!--THE END-->
> 
> - I can also make it such that we will be asking for their best time. So which one do you prefer? Also what more points do you think we should include. Name, time zone, best meeting time, meeting preference weekly or bi-weekly are what I can think now.   
>   
>   - - The more idea we have the better, ask more questions.
> 
> Jim, so glad we will be working together on help Hardik and team get the Giving Chain operational, please email questions and put edits on the wiki. Talk soon,  
   
Bobbi
