# Hyperledger Mentorship Program : Leizu

**Title**Lightweight Blockchain Management System**Status**

UNSELECTED

**Difficulty**

MEDIUM   

# Description

Leizu is a lightweight blockchain management system which can help organizations to manage their nodes(e.g peers/orderers/CAs) and it allow the organizations to customize their blockchain network. Meanwhile it provides a decentralized-governance manner to maintain consortium membership infrastructure independent. 

Currently we already implemented a prototype which is an all-in-one version, we can create a whole customize blockchain network in one step. However it is not our final goal, we would like a more decentralized version which described in our design document. We still need a lot of work to do. 

First we need develop a network creation flow which can be collaborated by multiple organizations. Second we may need abstract a deployer component which can be used independent. The deployer may need support Kubernetes as well.
