# Hyperledger Mentorship Program : Project plan - One-stop-shop Hyperledger Fabric performance analysis with Hyperledger Caliper (2023)

Created by Attila Klenik, last modified by Mayank Bondre on Aug 23, 2023

# Short description

The goal of the project is to provide a single entry/exit point to the performance analysis of Fabric by:

- Providing an open, well-designed, and thoroughly documented side-car service for the detailed performance analysis of distributed Fabric transaction traces.
- And integrating it into the Caliper load generation and response measurement process as part of the final report.

The project will heavily build on the PSWG's Performance Sandbox, aiming to "standardize" its flow and methodologies independently of the applied technologies.

# Work Done

**1. Study of Hyperledger Fabric Network and its consensus:**

I thoroughly explored the architecture and functionality of Hyperledger Fabric networks, gaining insight into components, peer roles, and consensus mechanisms essential for achieving distributed agreement.

**2. Log Collection for Insight:**

I undertook the task of collecting both INFO and DEBUG level logs, during various network operations - specifically versions 2.3 and 2.4. You can find collected logs here: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/mak2002/fabric-chaincode-logs)

**3. Exploration of Performance-related DEBUG LEVEL Logs:**

Explored the potential of DEBUG LEVEL logs for uncovering performance insights. By analysing these logs, I aim to identify hidden bottlenecks, resource usage patterns, and optimization opportunities.

4. **Analysing Logs related to Gateway Functionality**

# Chaincode Logging Analysis in Hyperledger Fabric Versions 2.3 and 2.4

The following table showcases the collected logs from deploying various chaincodes from the Hyperledger Fabric samples repository for analysis in versions 2.3 and 2.4.
