# Hyperledger Mentorship Program : Project Plan - Build a university course on Hyperledger Fabric using Hyperledger Umbra

Created by Rafael Belchior, last modified on Nov 09, 2020

**Document overview**

This document contains the roadmap of activities to accomplish the topics proposed by the 2020 internship project named [Build a university course on Hyperledger Fabric using Hyperledger Umbra](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/INTERN/Build+a+university+course+on+Hyperledger+Fabric+using+Hyperledger+Umbra). 

**Motivation for this internship**

A growing part of our community is our partnership with academia. Hyperledger Fabric and other Hyperledger projects are being incorporated in to research and education in universities more and more all over the world. Hyperledger can aid the growth by preparing study materials, sample lab experiments and quizzes and tests that teach computer science students about distributed systems and consensus algorithms and cryptography. Hyperledger Umbra has streamlined the process of setting up a full Hyperledger Fabric network running on a single computer. It provides an ideal environment for students to learn Hyperledger Fabric administration as well as use it for running lab experiments and learning exercises. This mentorship is focused on producing a "classroom-in-a-box" for an introductory computer science course on distributed systems and algorithms that can be offered to universities that wish to use Hyperledger Fabric in their curriculum.

**End Goal of this internship**

Build a self-contained master level university course that can be leveraged to teach enterprise blockchain technologies.

**Course Motivation &amp; Overview**

Provide a reliable basis for university students to learn blockchain through Hyperledger Fabric, and, optionally, other Hyperledger technologies.

This course is a 6-7.5 ECTS master level course that assumes 3 hours of theory per week + 1.5 weeks of practical classes (laboratory) per week. Each lab takes approximately 1.5h of work, plus autonomous study. Assuming 1 ECTS = 24 hours of work, the total effort predicted solely from lab classes is  48-60 hours.

The course is divided into two module: Module I introduces the technology (labs 1-4), and Module II focuses on Hyperledger Fabric (labs 5-9). For universities using trimesters, the course can be separated into the two modules (1 per trimester). For universities using semesters, the whole course (labs 1-9) can be taught in that semester.

**At the end of this course I will:**

1. Understand the concepts in which blockchain is based (labs 1 and 2), what is blockchain, and which problems it can solve (lab 3)
2. Know how Ethereum and Hyperledger Besu work. I will be able to write simple smart contracts and deploy them on several networks (lab 4)
3. Know Hyperledeger Fabric's components in detail, as well as its architecture and transactional model (labs 5,6,7)
4. Be able to write smart contracts (chaincode) for Hyperledger Fabric, and bootstrap a Hyperledger Fabric network running those contracts (labs 5,6,7)
5. Understand advanced concepts on the area of consensus, using Hyperledger Umbra (labs 8, 9)

**Course Requirements**

- Basic programming skills
- Basic Linux literacy (Bash)
- Basic understanding of Docker
