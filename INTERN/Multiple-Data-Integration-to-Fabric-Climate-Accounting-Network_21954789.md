# Hyperledger Mentorship Program : Multiple Data Integration to Fabric Climate Accounting Network

**Project Title**Multiple Data Integration to Fabric Climate Accounting Network**Status**

CANCELLED

**Difficulty**

 MEDIUM  

# Description

The [Hyperledger Labs blockchain-carbon-accounting project](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/blockchain-carbon-accounting) includes a Hyperledger Fabric network for recording the carbon and Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions that cause climate change.  Since there are many activities that cause such emissions, the network is designed to accept data from multiple sources of measurements.  In this project, we will demonstrate integrations from measurement sources with blockchain networks by integrating web- and mobile-based API's sources to turn instrumented readings into emissions measurements.   It will leverage previous projects involving Hyperledger Cactus, Vault security engines, and client security for Hyperledger Fabric.

Additional Information

Please see the following issue for ongoing development related to this mentorship: 

[https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/blockchain-carbon-accounting/issues/501](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/blockchain-carbon-accounting/issues/501)

The issue requires modifying an existing res-api operating as an oracle allowing the fabric emissions chaincode channel to request emission measurements/calculations from approved rest-apis.

The candidate should have a good grasp of setting up and deploying docker containers, understand how to run a Fabric network and building a rest-API. Should have experience using typescript and working with typeorm to setup connections to a structured database.

See [Transportation Emissions](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CASIG/pages/19006064/Transportation+Emissions), [Reducing Methane Leakage and Flaring through Supply Chain Tokens](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/events/pages/21792644/Reducing+Methane+Leakage+and+Flaring+through+Supply+Chain+Tokens) for ongoing projects related to this mentorship.

# Learning Objectives

This project will help you understand integrating different API's from both web and mobile applications with Hyperledger Fabric and other blockchain networks, as well as security and performance issues.

# Expected Outcome

Successful integration of the mobile apps and API's with Hyperledger Fabric

Benchmark comparison of Hyperledger Fabric and alternatives

Documentation and tutorials for integrating future data sources

# Relation to Hyperledger
