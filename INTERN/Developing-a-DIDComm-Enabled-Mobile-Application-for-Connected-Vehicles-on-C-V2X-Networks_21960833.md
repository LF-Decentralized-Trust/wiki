CODING DOCUMENTATION  RESEARCH

# Description

This project aims to create a mobile application tailored for connected vehicles, leveraging the foundational structure of the bifold wallet. The application will be compatible with Android Auto/Apple CarPlay, offering a seamless interface for vehicle owners. A notable advancement over the vanilla bifold wallet is the inclusion of DIDComm specifications to facilitate Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) communications within Cellular Vehicular-To-Everything (C-V2X) Networks. Key aspects of this initiative include:

- **Integration with C-V2X Networks:** Building the application within the C-V2X framework to enable comprehensive connectivity options for vehicles.
- **DIDComm Specifications:** Incorporating DIDComm V2 to support secure, private communication channels for V2V and V2I interactions.
- **Vehicle Discovery and Handshake Protocol:** Developing protocols to manage vehicle discovery and establish secure connections between vehicles and infrastructure.
- **DID Ecosystem for Vehicles:** Creating a decentralized identity (DID) ecosystem that connects vehicle credentials with vehicle owners, enhancing trust and security in vehicle interactions.

# Learning Objectives

The mentee will have the opportunity to:

1. Understand the integration of mobile applications with Android Auto/Apple CarPlay.
2. Learn about DIDComm specifications and their application in V2V and V2I communications.
3. Gain experience in the development of protocols for vehicle discovery and handshake mechanisms.
4. Develop an understanding of decentralized identity ecosystems within the automotive industry.
5. Acquire hands-on experience in programming for C-V2X networks.

# Expected Outcome and Deliverables

- A mobile application based on the bifold wallet, enhanced for use with Android Auto/Apple CarPlay.
- Implementation of DIDComm specifications to enable V2V and V2I communications.
- Protocols for vehicle discovery and secure handshake procedures.
- A robust DID ecosystem linking vehicle credentials with vehicle owners.
- Presentation of the completed application at Hyperledger forums, highlighting its architecture, functionality, and integration with C-V2X networks.

# Relation to Hyperledger and Impact on the community

By incorporating DIDComm specifications and fostering a DID ecosystem for vehicles, this project will significantly contribute to the Hyperledger community. It exemplifies the application of Hyperledger technologies in novel domains such as C-V2X networks, expanding the scope and impact of decentralized identity solutions in the automotive sector. This initiative not only demonstrates the versatility of Hyperledger frameworks in supporting secure, decentralized communication and identity verification but also promotes the adoption of Hyperledger technologies in emerging industries.

# Recommended Skills

We are seeking mentees with:

- A background in software development, preferably with experience in mobile application development for Android Auto and Apple CarPlay.
- Knowledge of DIDComm specifications and decentralized identity concepts.
- Interest and ability in working with C-V2X networks and developing communication protocols.
- Experience in contributing to open-source projects, with a keen interest in the Hyperledger ecosystem and automotive technologies.

# Future plans

We aim to refine and expand the application's capabilities, exploring additional functionalities and integrations within the C-V2X ecosystem. Our goal is to establish this project as a benchmark within Hyperledger Labs, showcasing the potential of Hyperledger technologies in the connected vehicles domain and encouraging further innovations.
