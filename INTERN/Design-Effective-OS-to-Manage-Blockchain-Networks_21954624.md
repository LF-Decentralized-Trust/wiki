# Hyperledger Mentorship Program : Design Effective OS to Manage Blockchain Networks

Created by Luke Chan, last modified by Manank Jain on Nov 25, 2019

**Title**

Design Effectively operational system to Customize and Manage Blockchain Network

**Status**

PROJECT COMPLETED

**Difficulty**

 MEDIUM  

# Description

Cello is aiming to resolve the following challenges, 1) Facilitate creation of blockchain network,  
can help user without blockchain background to setup their network quickly. 2) Security, need  
to implement mechanism to protect key pairs. 3) Cross organization communication, can connect  
blockchain networks among multiple organizations. This project targets to design and implement  
a practical operational system equipping with functionalities to solve above challenges, based on  
Hyperledger Cello code base.

# Additional Information

[Project repo](https://github.com/hyperledger/cello), [Available TODO features](https://jira.hyperledger.org/projects/CE/issues/), [Governing module](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Dw6cEKaul6FenORNkDcxvPDDKwpl0A5EmcJBlqAWJoU/edit)

# Learning Objectives

- Work closely with community experts and developers to learn the open-source culture and skills
- Advanced knowledge inside the blockchain and distributed ledger areas
- Hand-on experience with web application design and implement

# Expected Outcome

- Implemented new governing module to join blockchain networks together
- Advanced capabilities to manage blockchain networks, including life-cycle, chaincode, permission
- Other open objects that align with the existing roadmap

2. Security, need to implement mechanism to protect key pairs.
3. Cross organization communication, can connect blockchain networks among multiple organizations.

##### Project Deliverables

- API development
- Adding different agents for deployment of nodes
- Web Front-End Development for User Friendly Interface
- Unit Tests for maintaining code health
- Documentation for the APIs made and their metadata

##### Project Issues to be done

**Phase 1**

- Enhancement of Node API
- Implementation of \`Peer node\` API
- Creating operator for Kubernetes using operator-framework

**Phase 2**

- Implementation of other APIs
- Creating the Operator Controllers for CA
- Creating Operator Controllers for Peer and Orderer

**Phase 3**

- Handling the Certificates for the Peer and Orderer Nodes
- Refining of Custom Resource Specifications and Controllers
- Creation of Agent for Kubernetes Operator which handles the parts of frontend

**Phase 4**

- Deploying Agent images on Docker Hub
- Integration with the API / Dashboard
- Writing Specifications and User Documentation

##### Methodology

- Quarter basis review according to Hyperledger Internship Programme schedule
- Internal standup and updates:
  
  - Weekly meetings for planning on tasks and problem resolving
  - Using [Hyperledger Chat](http://chat.hyperledger.org) for quick discussions
