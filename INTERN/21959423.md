CODING 

# Description

This project aims to immerse the intern into the Iroha Java team. We expect the mentee to learn the coding practices of a professional software engineering team. Instead of having a set task, we hope the mentee will perform several optimisations and refactorings ranging from very easy to state-of-the-art. The mentee will also participate in upgrading the Iroha Java SDK after a significant change in the core Iroha API.

# Additional Information

Current Iroha-java [branch](https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha-java/tree/iroha2-dev).

# Learning Objectives

The mentee will improve their understanding of Java and code refactoring while practising with an SDK designed in Java for a Rust library.

# Expected Outcome

The precise outcomes are flexible and depend on the experience of the mentee and the goals set by the mentors during the initial meeting. For now, we provide a list of issues provided by the JavaSDK team that the mentee can work on.

- The Blockstream feature will allow monitoring of the appearance of the new blocks.
- The Java model generation needs to support Iroha `JSON` schemas better. For that to work, the code generator needs additional code to work with generic types.
- The internal serialiser code needs refactoring, and the deserialiser code needs fixing before that: it will allow for turning Java models into the genesis file and vice versa.
- The genesis configuration capabilities must be extended using `WithIroha` annotation and current mechanics to make the testing code more flexible. For example, there should be a feature to pass the Genesis file into `WithIroha` instead of a class.
- Testers should be able to run Java SDK tests on a local environment. The mentee must implement the new code to configure one’s Iroha peer and keys for this feature.

# Relation to Hyperledger

Iroha Java is part of Hyperledger Iroha and the preferred method of interaction for Android developers.

# Mentee Skills

Experience in Java or Kotlin.

It will help if the mentee has experience with the following tools:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [JUnit](https://junit.org/junit5/)
- [Gradle](https://gradle.org/)

# Future plans

After the updates are ready, they'll be an actively supported part of Iroha 2 SDK.
