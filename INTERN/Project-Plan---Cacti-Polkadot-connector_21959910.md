# Hyperledger Mentorship Program : Project Plan - Cacti Polkadot connector

Created by Jagpreet Singh Sasan, last modified on Dec 12, 2023

## **Abstract**

Creation of polkadot connector plugin, alongside its cactus-polkadot-all-in-one docker image (hosting a sample polkadot ledger for testing purposes) and the test-tooling package for the AIO

## **Methodology**

- Understand cacti codebase and the supplychain example (to understand what functionalities is generally expected from a connector)
- Understand a single connector (like besu connector) and its development lifecycle (how the connector is gradually created by first having its dockerised AIO, then its test tooling, then generation of code using a master openapi spec file, and then wiring up everything alongside the creation of the main connector class and finally having the connector README docs)
- Creation of polkadot AIO image (part1)
- COMMIT - 1: Creation of polkadot AIO image (part2) (this will take up time, thus dividing into 2 parts)
- COMMIT - 2: Creation of polkadot test tooling
- Creation of polkadot connector openapi specs, basic test case and connector class with base functions (part 1)
- COMMIT - 3: Creation of polkadot connector openapi specs, basic test case and connector class with base functions (part 2) (This will take up significant time, thus dividing into 2 parts)
- Updation of the openapi specs, test cases and addition of the rest of the code as per the requirements observed in commit 3 test cases (part 1)
- COMMIT - 4; Updation of the openapi specs, test cases and addition of the rest of the code as per the requirements observed in commit 3 test cases (part 2) (this will take up the most time, thus dividing into 2 parts)
- COMMIT - 5: Creation of [README.md](http://README.md) for the connector plugin and architecture reference diagrams
- Creation of PR with the 5 progressive commits and incorporation of review comments
- Creation of final presentation/demo to showcase the work done in this project
