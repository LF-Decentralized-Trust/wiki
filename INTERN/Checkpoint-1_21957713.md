The Letter:

Hello, I am Bobbi Muscara, and welcome to the Giving Chain Project. As most of you know the giving chain project was a grassroots effort in the summer of 2019.  This year it was accepted in the Hyperledger Mentorship program where with the help of everyone reading this email we can take our proof of concept into a minimal viable product that has the potential to change the world. Let me introduce you to the team, Myself, Jim Sullivan, and the mentee for the project Hardik Gupta.  I was lucky enough to be one of the people involved in the Proof of Concept for the Giving Chain and I will be acting as Mentor/Project Manager. Next is my associate Jim Sullivan who is technical expertise in the Hyperledger community will be acting as Mentor/Technical Lead. Last but not least Hardik Gupta, Mentee / Project Manager, and Technical  Lead.

Hello, I hope this reaches you in the best of your health.  
My name is Hardik Gupta. I welcome you once again. As you are aware, that I have been selected as a Mentee, Project Manager, and Technical Lead for The Giving Chain, I would like to invite you to be a part of this journey. I'm dedicated to this project and am truly looking forward to working on it with all of you. I believe that The Giving Chain has the potential of changing the lives of many individuals and motivating both the donors and the recipients. It will not only make a huge impact on society but also bring transparency to the rigged system that has been misused or altered for one's personal needs or gains. 

Please take a moment out of your day and fill out a brief survey to determine the best time for our meetings. ([https://forms.gle/4QWYgyzwspZFSptt5](https://forms.gle/4QWYgyzwspZFSptt5))

Thank You, hoping for you to be a part of this beautiful journey!

Bobbi and Hardik
