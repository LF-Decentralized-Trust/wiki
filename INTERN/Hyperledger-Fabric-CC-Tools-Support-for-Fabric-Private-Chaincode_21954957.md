CODING DOCUMENTATION  RESEARCH

# Description

Fabric Private Chaincode (FPC) leverages modern Confidential Computing technology, such as Intel SGX, to enhance the protection of chaincode and their data while executed at the endorsing peers. Client applications interact with their private chaincode via the FPC Client SDK, which is responsible to encrypt and authenticate the invocation arguments before being sent to the endorsing peers. Currently chaincodes can be developed in C++ or Golang.

The Hyperledger Labs CC-Tools library offers several features that facilitate the journey of learning, development and deployment of chaincode for Hyperledger Fabric in Golang.

The goal of this mentorship project is the design and the integration of FPC as a destination for the code developed using CC-Tools. This also includes the creation of appropriate samples and documentation. The project requires a solid understanding of theory and practice of software development using Golang, distributed systems, and security. During the project you will get hands-on experience with the development of Hyperledger chaincode, the deployment of Fabric networks, the transaction lifecycle, and Confidential Computing technology.

# Learning Objectives

- Deep dive into Hyperledger Fabric, in particular, Fabric Private Chaincode using Confidential Computing, and the Hyperledger Lab CC-Tools
- Experience an active open-source community
- Mastering open-source workflow
- Enhance your designing and implementing skills, testing, documentation, and project management.

# Expected Outcome and Deliverables

- Actively collaborate with the FPC community and contribute to the FPC/CC-Tools github repository
- Design and implementation of integration of FPC into the CC-Tools
- - Investigate the the capabilities of FPC and CC-Tools
  - Design a CC-Tools integration that is compatible with the FPC API
  - Implement the new integration
  - Test the new approach using unit-tests and integration-tests
- Sample applications demonstrating the use of the new CC-Tool integration
- Documentation and tutorials for the new CC-Tool integration
- Bonus: a technical blog post
- Having fun
