# Hyperledger Mentorship Program : Project Plan - Implement optimizations passes, compiler parser upgrade and overflow detection for big integer multiplication

Created by salaheldin\_sameh, last modified on Jun 18, 2022

## **Abstract**

Solang is a solidity compiler for Solana, Ewasm and substrate. What is required in the project three main subprojects: add overflow detection to integers represented with more than 64 bits, improve Solang's parser to continue parsing after encountering a parser error and finally, generate more optimized LLVM-IR for solidity code containing array bound checks.

## **Deliverables**

- Overflow detection for big unsigned/signed integers
- improved LLVM-IR for array boundary checks
- improved diagnostics generated by Solang's parser

## **Milestones**

### **Evaluation 1 :**

- Creating temporary variables that hold dynamic array lengths after pushes and pops
- Replace ArrayLength expression with the temporary variable mapped to the dynamic array

### **Evaluation 2 :**

- Make changes to \_\_mul32() (the function that handles multiplication of big integers), and change how is it called by Solang's code emitter.
- Add a signed version to \_\_mul32 that handles signed numbers.
- Add overflow detection to pow().

### **Evaluation 3 :**

- Integrate Larpop's error recovery technique for Solang's parser

### **Evaluation 4 :**

- Implement a recovery technique for semantic errors.

Evaluation 4

Provide tests and documentation for semantic error recovery

## **Methodology:**

1- For each milestone, I will have daily discussions with mentors over discord and weekly over zoom, in order to know if I am being on the right track. I will continuously inform my mentors of my progress in each issue.   
2- I will work on multiple issues concurrently but will try to adhere to the project plan as much as possible.

## **Documentation:**

Documentation for each milestone will be provided upon milestone delivery.
