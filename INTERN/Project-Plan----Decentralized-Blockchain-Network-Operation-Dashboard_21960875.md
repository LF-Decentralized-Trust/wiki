# Hyperledger Mentorship Program : Project Plan - Decentralized Blockchain Network Operation Dashboard

Created by Haibo Yang, last modified on Jun 29, 2024

## **Abstract**

Hyperledger Cello provides a Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS) platform designed to simplify the creation, management and use of blockchain networks.

The main goal of the mentorship is to upgrade Hyperledger Cello to support Hyperledger Fabric 2.5 LTS, and to continuously optimize and fix backend APIs and the blockchain operation dashboard, contributing to the overall stability and performance of blockchain solutions deployed through Cello.

The following diagram shows Cello's architectural design.
