# Hyperledger Mentorship Program : Project Plan - SSA intermediate representation for the Solang compiler

Created by Guilherme Kowalczuk, last modified by Evan Zhao on Dec 18, 2023

# Implement an SSA intermediate representation for the Solang compiler

## Abstract

Solang is an open-source Solidity compiler written in Rust. It currently generates an intermediate representation in a Control Flow Graph (CFG) for each function in a Solidity contract during compilation. This project aims to implement a lower-level Static Single-Assignment (SSA) intermediate representation between the CFG and the LLVM-IR. The SSA representation will allow further optimizations during compilation, such as liveness analysis and partial redundancy elimination.

## Deliverables

- The three-address code format: implement the data structure of the new three-address code format CFG.

<!--THE END-->

- The three-address code format: Implement a text dump function for the new CFG. (+ unit tests)

<!--THE END-->

- The three-address code format: Convert the old CFG into the new CFG of three-address codes. (+ unit tests)

<!--THE END-->

- Implement SSA: insert phi functions into the new CFG. (+ unit tests)

<!--THE END-->

- (Optional) Implement SSA: rename variables to generate SSA format. (+ unit tests)

## Methodology

Weekly check-ins to report project progress. Chat with Lucas on Discord for questions. Attend daily Solang meetups to report progress and ask questions.

Read the book "SSA-based Compiler Design" for a detailed explanation of all the algorithms required to implement SSA.
