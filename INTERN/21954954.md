**Project Title**

FabricConfigurator: Enhancing Hyperledger Fabric with Intuitive Configuration Interface

**Status**

UNSELECTED

**Primary Focus**

CODING DOCUMENTATION  RESEARCH

# Description

FabricConfigurator aims to complement existing network deployment solution by simplify the configuration process for Hyperledger Fabric networks by developing an intuitive user interface. The project's objective is to enhance user experience by allowing users to easily create, import, and manage network configurations without requiring extensive technical knowledge.

**Problem/Opportunity**: Currently, while there are solutions available to create Hyperledger Fabric Network but none explains the configuration or suggests what are the possibilities in configuration. Therefore configuring Hyperledger Fabric networks is complex and time-consuming, often requiring manual definition or limited visibility and understanding of what all can be configured. Even when configured, reading and understanding what has been configured is difficult and complex. This complexity leads to user frustration and hinders efficient deployment and utilization of capabilities of Fabric networks.

**Implementation Path:** The project will start with research into existing network configuration tools and user requirements. Following this, the development phase will involve creating a user-friendly interface that can read existing network configurations and allow users to import or create new configurations using a wizard-based approach.

# Learning Objectives

1. **Technical Proficiency:**
   
   - Gain hands-on experience with Hyperledger Fabric technology, including understanding its architecture, components, and configuration parameters.
   - Develop skills in frontend development by creating an intuitive user interface for network configuration, utilizing technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
2. **Problem-Solving and Iterative Development:**
   
   - Learn how to address complex problems in software development through iterative design and implementation cycles, driven by user feedback and testing.
   - Enhance critical thinking and troubleshooting abilities by identifying and resolving issues encountered during the development process.
3. **Open Source Collaboration:**
   
   - Gain exposure to the collaborative nature of open source projects by contributing to FabricConfigurator alongside other developers and community members.
   - Learn best practices for communication, collaboration, and version control within an open source environment, fostering skills essential for future contributions to open source projects.
4. **User-Centric Design:**
   
   - Develop an understanding of user experience (UX) design principles by focusing on creating an interface that caters to the needs and preferences of diverse users, improving usability and accessibility.
   - Gain insights into user research methodologies and usability testing techniques to iteratively refine the application based on user feedback.
5. **Documentation and Support:**
   
   - Learn the importance of clear and comprehensive documentation in open source projects by documenting development processes, codebase structure, and usage instructions for FabricConfigurator.
   - Develop skills in providing user support and assistance, addressing user inquiries, issues, and feedback effectively to foster a positive user experience and project adoption.

# Expected Outcome and Deliverables

- **Documentation** of the Requirement
- **Design** of the solution (solution architecture, design decisions and tools used).
- **Code**
- **Demonstrable application** that can import/read/display/create network configurations using a Web Interface
- **Future Roadmap**

# Relation to Hyperledger and Impact on the community

This mentorship project is related to Hyperledger Fabric, Bevel, and Fabric Operator, among others. FabricConfigurator enhances Fabric usability by simplifying network configuration, potentially increasing adoption. It may complement Bevel by providing an interface for creating, reading/finalizing network configurations. Integration with Fabric Operator could enhance configuration capabilities for managing Fabric deployments in Kubernetes. Overall, FabricConfigurator aims to improve the user experience and lower barriers to deploying and managing Fabric networks.
