# Hyperledger Mentorship Program : Implementing DIDMan-Based Openwallet for Hyperledger Indy Ecosystem

Created by Vinod Panicker, last modified by Min Yu on Jun 07, 2024

**Project Title**

# Implementing DIDMan-Based Openwallet for Hyperledger Indy Ecosystem

**Status**

IN PROGRESS

**Primary Focus**

CODING DOCUMENTATION  RESEARCH

# Description

Our project aims to integrate [DIDMan](https://github.com/DIDman/DRman) specifications into the existing [Bifold wallet](https://github.com/openwallet-foundation/bifold-wallet?tab=readme-ov-file), an [OpenWallet](https://openwallet.foundation/) solution originally from the Hyperledger community and now a mutual project with the Openwallet Foundation. This integration necessitates attention to several key components, including authentication, DID management, cryptographic operations, interoperability, user interface, security, and backup and recovery processes. The Bifold wallet will be enhanced to feature a secure authentication mechanism fully supportive of the DIDMan specification for managing DIDs, their associated keys, and metadata. In addition, this wallet will maintain its capabilities for cryptographic operations, provide a user-friendly interface, ensure robust security measures, and offer efficient backup and recovery options. Through adherence to the DIDMan specification, the Bifold wallet will ensure compatibility and interoperability with other compliant systems, fostering the wider adoption of decentralized identity technologies.

# Additional Information

The project DRman aims to develop a stand-alone utility for provisioning Verifiable Credential Registries (VCR). This utility will also support the administration of the registry, containing credentials issued by organizations. Core functionalities, such as the creation, verification, modification, and revocation of credentials, are fundamental to this project, enabling administrators to manage the VCR effortlessly.

Key considerations for the project include:

1. **Creation (of DID Registry):** Function to create a DID Registry for an organization on Git.
2. **Onboarding:** Function to add enable/restrict access to members of an organization to a repository (e.g., using a combination of GitHub private tokens, GitHub username &amp; users DID).
3. **Management:** Function to list APIs that are needed to add/update/revoke access DID’s or (DID Document) saved as files on the repo.
4. **Adoption of Hyperledger AnonCreds:**  Incorporating the [Hyperledger AnonCreds specification](https://hyperledger.github.io/anoncreds-spec/) for our DIDs, signifying a commitment to leveraging advanced cryptographic techniques and privacy-preserving protocols..

# Learning Objectives

1. Develop an understanding of decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and their role in decentralized identity systems.
2. Familiarize with the DIDMan specification, including its APIs and data structures essential for the effective management of DIDs, their associated keys, and metadata.
3. Acquire the skills necessary for integrating the DIDMan specification into the existing Bifold wallet, enhancing its functionalities within the Hyperledger Indy ecosystem.
4. Gain experience in performing cryptographic operations for secure key generation, signing, and verification of transactions.
5. Further develop the user-centric interface of the Bifold wallet, based on its existing project framework, to ensure it facilitates easy navigation and interaction with its enhanced features.
6. Learn to prioritize security throughout the design and development phases of decentralized identity systems, embedding robust protection mechanisms against potential threats.
7. Understand the importance of interoperability in promoting the adoption of decentralized identity technologies.
8. Cultivate a sense of responsibility towards protecting the sensitive information of users.
9. Demonstrate the ability to contribute to articles, blog posts, or white papers related to decentralized identity and DIDMan specification.

# Expected Outcome and Deliverables

- Deepen understanding of decentralized identity systems through the integration of the DIDMan specification with the existing Bifold wallet.
- Gain practical experience in cryptography, highlighting the significance of security and user experience in these integrations.
- Learn about interoperability and its critical role in the seamless functioning of decentralized identity technologies.
- Contribute to open-source projects, enhancing the Bifold wallet with the DIDMan specification.

# Relation to Hyperledger and Impact on the community

The project's integration with the Bifold wallet and adoption of Hyperledger AnonCreds aligns with Hyperledger Indy's goals, enhancing decentralized identity solutions and contributing to the community's adoption of such technologies.

# Recommended Skills

- Strong React Native programming skills for developing robust applications.
- Graduate or master's students preferred, with a focus on software development or related fields.
- Familiarity with decentralized identity concepts and the Hyperledger Indy and Aries frameworks.
- Experience with cryptographic protocols and understanding of DIDMan specifications.
- Ability to contribute to open-source projects, with keen interest in the Hyperledger ecosystem.

# Future plans

Our objective is to finalize our application as a solid project within the Hyperledger Labs, emphasizing its integration with DRMan for seamless functionality. By doing so, we aim to advance decentralized identity technologies within the Hyperledger community, enhancing the ecosystem's interoperability and user experience.
