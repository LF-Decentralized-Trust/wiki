# Hyperledger Mentorship Program : HL Iroha and HL Quilt Integration

Created by Sara Garifullina, last modified by Min Yu on Dec 01, 2020

**Title**We will be enabling interoperability between HL Quilt and HL Iroha **Status**

COMPLETED

**Difficulty**

MEDIUM  

# Description

Hyperledger Quilt is a Java implementation of [Interledger](https://interledger.org/rfcs/0027-interledger-protocol-4/ "https://interledger.org/rfcs/0027-interledger-protocol-4/"), a suite of open protocols and standards that allows payments interoperability across any currency - fiat or crypto. And Iroha is great with asset management, which makes those two projects a perfect fit! 

With this internship program we will not only allow the interoperability between different asset-carrying blockchains but also help create a system of Iroha networks that will only share some information, that is a requested feature.

# Learning Objectives

The mentee will be able to learn:

- ways of integrating different projects from architectural point of view
- architecture of Iroha and Quilt
- work in true spirit of open-source, communicating with both Iroha and Quilt community, joining calls and using other community tools
- writing documentation, so anyone in the community could use the results of their work

# Expected Outcome

Documented, ready-to-use integration from both Iroha and Quilt sides

# Relation to Hyperledger

This mentorship program will enable interoperability between HL Quilt and HL Iroha projects

# Education Level

No specific education is needed, see skills

# Skills

Java and C++

# Future plans

Create documentation and offer the community a new way of creating networks

# Preferred Hours and Length of Internship

No preference
