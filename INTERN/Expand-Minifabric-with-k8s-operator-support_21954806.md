# Hyperledger Mentorship Program : Expand Minifabric with k8s operator support

Created by Tong Li, last modified by Min Yu on Dec 19, 2022

**Project Title**The project is to add k8s operators to setup hyperledger Fabric running in k8s using k8s operators**Status**

COMPLETED

**Difficulty**

MEDIUM  

# Description

Minifabric supports deploy Hyperledger Fabric in both docker and K8S environments, however, it currently does not support Hyperledger Fabric running as k8s operators. Making Minifabric deploying Hyperledger Fabric onto K8S and running as K8S operators will allow hyperledger fabric network nodes with taking advantages of K8S operator benefit. This work will involve the participators to develop K8S operators, deploying K8S operator controllers and managing K8S operator life cycles, at the same time, the participators will be able to learn Fabric and Fabric deployment model. This is a great opportunity for anyone who would like to know K8S and know Hyperledger Fabric.

# Learning Objectives

At the successful finish of the project, one will be able to gain the skills in K8S operator development, deployment, the applicant will also learn concept of Hyperledger Fabric, blockchain, will improve his or her skills in go lang, ansible, VS Code. These skills will provide the mentee great opportunities in the job market.

# Expected Outcome

1. Minifabric will support deploying Fabric onto K8S cluster running as Operator
   
2. Minifabric will provides command to create channels
3. Minifabric will provides command to deploy chaincode
