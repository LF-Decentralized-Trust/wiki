# Hyperledger Mentorship Program : Asset tracking

Created by Anonymous, last modified by Min Yu on Mar 24, 2022

**Project Title**Utilizing Hyperledger Fabric to Develop Maritime Supply Chain Application using MQTT protocol.**Status**

UNSELECTED

**Difficulty**

MEDIUM 

# Description

Utilize Hyperledger Fabric framework to develop Container shipment tracking application using Blockchain consensus algorithms and incorporate them into MQTT Protocol and Implement cross-chain Deployment.

This application tracks shipment using the MQTT protocol. From shipment origin to handling at docks via constantly monitoring package until it reaches the final destination along with providing an in-depth verified report and Reduces Tracking error. MQTT protocols which would help  to perform data abstraction from the edge telemetry data, parse that data into the Blockchain transaction format, validate the transactions and then write them to the Blockchain This not only serves the same purpose as the MQTT broker in the traditional sense but would also provide a method to trace and store historical data simultaneously, all within a distributed network

Add the existing Hyperledger Sawtooth Supply Chain application ([https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-supply-chain](https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-supply-chain)) to Hyperledger Fabric. Working on Different Techniques to Reduce Data Complexity. Contribute this source code to Hyperledger Fabric’s sample repository ([https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples)).

Write up a detailed comparative analysis with the existing technology after implementing smart contracts In addition, document the steps required to convert a running application in Hyperledger Sawtooth to Hyperledger Fabric and vice versa. Time permitting develop a tool that will convert chaincode to transaction families and vice versa.

# Learning Objectives

Deep understanding of blockchain technology and hyper ledger fabric technology through training and Developing.

Solve Existing Supply chain tracking error and loss of information Data 

Reducing Data Complexity.

Digitalising the existing model(paper-based) with modern IoT applications

# Expected Outcome

Maritime trace application with Fabric framework and demos. Technical document and comparative analysis report between Traditional Methods and RFID using MQTT. Performance analysis demo.

# Relation to Hyperledger

Hyperledger Fabric, Hyperledger Sawtooth.

# Education Level

Graduate student or Undergraduate

# Skills

Languages: Javascript, Go, Python

Blockchain platforms: Hyperledger Fabric (basic); Hyperledger Sawtooth (basic)

MQTT Protocol

Collaboration tools: Github.

# Future plans

Identifying Problems in existing Maritime SC models and Improving them. Explore the latest Technology replacing RFID using MQTT protocol aimed at improving the accuracy of a model.

Create an Enterprise-grade application that could be deployed on various cloud platforms. We would use HL Bevel for this task.

Participate in local meetups and involve in open community discussions.
