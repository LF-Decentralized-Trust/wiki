# Hyperledger Mentorship Program : Project Plan - Iroha 2: DSL

Created by Victor Gridnevsky, last modified on Jun 30, 2023

# Description

Iroha 2 currently has WASM-based smartcontracts. WASM, however, imposes a maintainer burden on the user, so upgrading these takes work.

We also have an ISI based on easily upgradeable smartcontract facilities, which are difficult to compose into arbitrary logic but require no manual intervention for upgrading to newer versions of Iroha.

We would like to involve the community in creating a domain-specific language for creating and composing logic made out of ISI.

Iroha 2 DSL is our most important project. Therefore, we would like it to be considered with top priority if not all Iroha-based projects can be considered for the internship programme.
