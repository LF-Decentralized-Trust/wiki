# Hyperledger Mentorship Program : Project Plan - DRman 2022

Created by Daev Mithran, last modified on Nov 30, 2022

## **Abstract**

Drman is a cli tool written in shell scripts and is currently under development. The purpose of this project is to implement Github/Gitlab based DID Registries. We can split the work into three main milestones: resolve existing issues in the respository, create detailed architectural diagrams and implementation of the architecture.

## **Methodology**

After I start working each milestone, my mentor and I will have a planning session to define the best way to tackle the challenges. Then, I will execute the planning and schedule a review session with my mentor. In addition to those meetings, we are doing bi-weekly calls to review the progress of the project. Every meeting summary will noted down in the repository
