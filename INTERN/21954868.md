DOCUMENTATION  

# Description

We are writing to propose a Hyperledger mentorship program focused on enhancing the onboarding documentation and experience.  In collaboration with the Mentors, the Mentee can provide valuable updates to the Hyperledger Onboarding Documentation and the Hyperledger Start Here guide ([https://start-here.hyperledger.org/](https://start-here.hyperledger.org/)) to help new community members gain a quicker and deeper understanding of Hyperledger blockchain projects and technology.

The Hyperledger “Start Here” guide ([https://start-here.hyperledger.org/](https://start-here.hyperledger.org/)) is a comprehensive resource for anyone interested in learning more about Hyperledger and its various projects. The guide is designed for both technical and non-technical users and provides a step-by-step approach to understanding the core concepts and components of Hyperledger.

The guide is currently structured into four main sections: Introduction, Learn, Try, and Build. The Introduction section provides an overview of Hyperledger and its various projects, as well as information on how to get involved with the community. The Learn section dives deeper into the technical aspects of Hyperledger and covers topics such as blockchain fundamentals, distributed ledger technology, and smart contracts. The Try section provides instructions on how to set up a development environment and run sample applications using Hyperledger Fabric, Sawtooth, and Indy. Finally, the Build section offers guidance on how to build your own applications using Hyperledger and provides resources for further learning.

# Additional Information

One of the strengths of the Hyperledger “Start Here” guide is its focus on practical applications of blockchain technology. The guide provides real-world examples of how Hyperledger can be used in various industries, such as healthcare, supply chain, and finance. Additionally, the Try section allows users to gain hands-on experience with Hyperledger by running sample applications and experimenting with the technology.

Another strength of the “Start Here” guide is its accessibility to non-technical users. The guide provides clear explanations of technical concepts and terms and offers step-by-step instructions for setting up a development environment and running applications. This makes it easier for users with little to no technical background to understand and experiment with Hyperledger.

The Hyperledger Start Here guide is an excellent resource for anyone interested in learning more about Hyperledger and blockchain technology. Its comprehensive approach, practical examples, and accessibility make it a valuable resource for both technical and non-technical users.

As your mentors, we would be happy to meet with you once a week via a Zoom call to discuss your progress, answer questions, and provide feedback on your work. We can also help you set goals and milestones to ensure that you are making progress towards your learning objectives.

# Learning Objectives

Here is an overview of what can be achieved through this mentorship program:

1. Gain a solid understanding of the Hyperledger Start Here guide and its various components.
2. Learn about various Hyperledger projects and how to enhance the existing resources to be more discoverable and easier to use.
3. Create personas and process flow diagrams to arrive at the best framework for consolidating the Hyperledger onboarding documentation into a unified and easy to access resource.
4. Explore real-world use cases for blockchain technology and understand how Hyperledger can be used in these scenarios and applied to the onboarding documentation.
5. Provide practical advice and insights on how to overcome common challenges when working on the onboarding documentation, including looking at the internal and external linking strategy to the Hyperledger “Start Here” documentation.
6. Gain insight on how to apply what you have learned from the Hyperledger “Start Here” guide to other applicable roles within the community.
7. The mentorship program should also help the mentee build a network of contacts within the Hyperledger community, which can provide valuable support and resources for future learning and professional development.

# Expected Outcome

The expected outcome would be for the mentee to update the Hyperledger Onboarding Documentation and the Hyperledger Start Here guide ([https://start-here.hyperledger.org/](https://start-here.hyperledger.org/)) to help new community members gain a quicker and deeper understanding of Hyperledger blockchain projects and technology.  This would be through the development of content and graphics that are relevant to the onboarding process, based on research and outreach to members of the Hyperledger Community.  The mentee will create personas and process flow diagrams to arrive at the best framework for consolidating the Hyperledger onboarding documentation into a unified and easy to access resource.  Update the dashboard and the landing page for driving the user engagement.  Develop the ability to search events and happenings within the Hyperledger community.

The path to contributions is optimized, specifically regarding how many clicks it takes the user to reach the contributing guidelines of each top level project.

Currently this number is 5 for each project with the navigation path looking like:

*Home Page → Hyperledger Projects → Cacti (or any other project) → Repository Link (GitHub) → CONTRIBUTING.md (GitHub)*

Two assumptions are made here:

1. There is a CONTRIBUTING.md file (or similar, easily recognizable documentation) in the project root
2. The user *knows* where to click, e.g. they understand that the best path forward is to make the navigation decisions as shown above

What could be helpful to users is:

1. A separate link on the project detail card (where the Repository Link is) that goes directly to CONTRIBUTING.md (or similar guide)
2. An additional link like the one described in 1) but this time placed on the header of the *Issues* page where the good-first-issue tagged issues are listed from the tracker of each project. This (might) alleviate the need for us to have a separate top level menu item specifically for the contributing guides.

**Suggested bug-fixes, additional optimizations**

1. "List of active issues raised in last 7 days can be found here." under "Issues" does not work, as-in, when you click on it issues are shown from 2021.
   
   1. On top of the problem with issues being outdated, the lists always only appear to show one issue instead of a list of them.
2. The "Issues" menu item could be renamed to "Contributions to Work On" or "Issue Tracker" or "What To Work on".
3. There could be a separate menu item for "Good First Issues" which would provide a similar list of issues as the current "Issues" menu item but pre-filtered for issues that were tagged as "good-first-issue"

# Relation to Hyperledger

This mentorship would help the Onboarding Task Force with updating the Onboarding documentation and resources for the Hyperledger Foundation Community.  These updates should help with enabling new members of the community to engage faster and more effectively. 

# Mentee Skills

Any skills around research and documentation, including the ability to write documentation content and design and develop explainer graphs or images for use on the Hyperledger wiki.

- User experience design.
- HTML, CSS, Material UI.
- JavaScript.
- Go Lang.
- Git, Markdown.
- React framework would be an added advantage.

# Mentee Open Source Contribution Experience

None Required

# Future plans

Ongoing work with the Onboarding Task Force to engage with the Hyperledger Community and maintain the Hyperledger onboarding documentation.
