MEDIUM   

# Description

This project aims to provide a python SDK for the latest fabric(1.4 and 2.0+). The functions since fabric 1.0 have been supported, including create/join channel, chaincode install/instantiation/invoke, etc.) and more functionalities are under implementation. The intern is expected to read issues on jira and help completing the tasks, including refining APIs, enhancing test, creating sample applications and so on. Besides, performance improvement such as asynchronous transaction sending/receiving methods are also considered. Furthermore, chaincode in python could also be supported.
