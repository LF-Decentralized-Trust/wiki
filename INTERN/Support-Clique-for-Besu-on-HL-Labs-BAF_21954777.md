# Hyperledger Mentorship Program : Support Clique for Besu on HL Labs BAF

Created by Sownak Roy, last modified by Roshan Raut on Nov 25, 2021

**Project Title**Support Clique Consensus for Besu on HL Labs Blockchain Automation Framework**Status**

COMPLETED

**Difficulty**

MEDIUM  

# Description

Hyperledger Labs [Blockchain Automation Framework](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/blockchain-automation-framework)(BAF) is a tool to deploy different DLT platforms automatically on a given Kubernetes cluster. BAF supports multi-cloud and multi-DLT deployments, and already supports HL Fabric, HL Besu, Quorum, R3 Corda. For HL Besu, currently only IBFT2 Consensus is supported by BAF.

With this internship program we want to support the Clique consensus for Besu, so that BAF can be used to deploy and operate a HL Besu network with Clique consensus. This will also include upgrading BAF to support the latest stable Besu version.

# Learning Objectives

The mentee will be able to learn:

- Production grade architecture.
- DevOps in Blockchain Development.
- Architecture of Besu and BAF.
- work in true spirit of open-source, communicating with both Besu and BAF community, joining calls and using other community tools.
- writing documentation, so anyone in the community could use the results of their work.
- following rules and standards of open-source projects created by Hyperledger.

# Expected Outcome

1. Documented, ready-to-use Besu Clique consensus on BAF.
2. Documented upgrade of Besu to latest stable on BAF.

# Relation to Hyperledger

This mentorship program will enable interoperability between [Hyperledger Besu](https://www.hyperledger.org/use/besu) and Hyperledger Labs [Blockchain Automation Framework](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/blockchain-automation-framework)(BAF) projects.

# Education Level
