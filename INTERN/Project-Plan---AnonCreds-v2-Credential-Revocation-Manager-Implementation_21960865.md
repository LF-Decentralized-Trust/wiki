# Hyperledger Mentorship Program : Project Plan - AnonCreds v2 Credential Revocation Manager Implementation

Created by Stephen Curran, last modified by VictorH2208 on Jun 22, 2024

## **Abstract**

The Revocation Manager is a component of the Hyperledger AnonCreds v2 framework, aimed at improving the management of credential revocations with a focus on scalability, privacy, and security. Utilizing ALLOSAUR, an advanced cryptographic algorithm, the Revocation Manager is designed to handle high volumes of credential transactions with minimal data exchange to preserve user privacy. The system will be built using Rust for cryptographic processing and Python with FlaskAPI for the web interface. Further, the Revocation Manager is engineered to support deployment across multiple instances, facilitating robust multi-party computation (MPC) connections. This feature allows for distributed operation and data handling, reducing the load on any single system and enhancing overall service availability and fault tolerance. The deployment strategy is tailored to ensure that even in a distributed environment, data integrity and system responsiveness are maintained, making it an ideal solution for enterprises seeking scalable and secure digital credential management.

## **Deliverables**

- Web Service that implements an ALLOSAUR Revocation Manager.
- An API for clients to use the Revocation Manager.
- Unit and integration tests for the service.
- GitHub Actions to invoke the tests, and when triggered, release artifacts for published versions of the implementation.
- Documentation for deploying and configuring a horizontally scalable instance of the web service.

## **Milestones**

**Eval 1:**

- Create a new GitHub repository
- Define and implement an API
- Get the new implementation running using Docker and document how to run a local instance.

**Eval 2:**

- Integrate the Rust cryptography components using FFI with the Python Flask API
- Implement basic MPC and sharding functionalities
- Conduct initial testing on Docker deployment

**Eval 3:**

- Complete comprehensive integration and performance tests
- Finalize documentation with detailed sections on Docker setup, MPC integration, and API usage

**Eval 4:**

- Conduct final system evaluations in a production-like environment using Docker
