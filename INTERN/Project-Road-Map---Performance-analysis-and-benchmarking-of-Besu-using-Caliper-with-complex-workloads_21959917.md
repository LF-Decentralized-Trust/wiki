# Hyperledger Mentorship Program : Project Road Map - Performance analysis and benchmarking of Besu using Caliper with complex workloads

Created by Nischal Sharma, last modified on Jun 22, 2023

### Abstract

The objective of this project is to perform a performance and benchmarking analysis of BESU, a Hyperledger project, in private networks (QBFT, IBFT, CLIQUE) using Hyperledger Caliper. This project aims to identify the strengths and weaknesses of BESU in terms of maximum transactions per second, latency, computation power, hard disk space, etc. Additionally, this project aims to add support for more complex and well-known workloads like ERC20, ERC721 in Caliper, which are used by general Ethereum users. This project will provide valuable insights into the performance of BESU and will help developers optimise it for better performance.

### Deliverables

The expected deliverables of this project are:

- A detailed report on the performance of BESU in private networks (QBFT, IBFT2, CLIQUE)
- A set of benchmarks for BESU in private network with different configurations
- Support for ERC20, ERC721, etc complex workloads in Hyperledger Caliper
- Finding and solving bottlenecks in Besu to improve performance
- Documentation on how to use the benchmarking tool and the new workloads
- Documentation of the benchmark results and improvements

### Milestones

#### Evaluation 1

- Create custom workloads
- Review and test the custom workloads data

#### Evaluation 2

- Workloads integration into Caliper
- Run and Document Benchmarking Tests with different workloads

#### Evaluation 3

- Tweak and Tune Besu configs and parameters to get better performance
- Find bottlenecks in Besu and create issue tickets

#### Evaluation 4

- Suggest and Solve the issues in Besu Repo
- Document everything
- Research document which contains the performance metrics comparison between the before and after data.
