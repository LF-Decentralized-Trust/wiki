# Hyperledger Mentorship Program : Why Mentor

Created by Min Yu, last modified on Mar 16, 2023

Here are some reasons to consider putting yourself forward as a mentor and formally participate in the HyperledgerÂ Mentorship Program:

- You believe in the value of mentorship in helping new developers to navigate open source development, the culture, the tooling and infrastructure to be a productive member of the community.
- You are passionate about teaching and guiding new developers, many of whom may be first time open-source contributors.
- You are eager to bring in new perspectives, new ideas, and new talent into your community and projects.
- You have a narrowly scoped development project with clear learning objectives/outcomes. You believe that the potential contributions of the mentee's work through completing this mentorship project could add value to the larger project or the Hyperledger community of which you're an active developer or maintainer.
