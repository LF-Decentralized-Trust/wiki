# Hyperledger Mentorship Program : Project Plan - Hyperledger Web3j: Enhancing Android Support with Updated web3j-android Integration

Created by Nischal Sharma, last modified by Shashank Kumar 4-Yr B.Tech.: Pharmaceutical Engg. &amp; Tech., IIT(BHU) on Jul 01, 2024

# Abstract

The Hyperledger Web3j-android library enables Android applications to interact with the Ethereum blockchain using Hyperledger web3j. This project aims to update and restructure the library (version 4.8.8) to comply with modern Android development standards and current Ethereum technologies, enhancing coherence and functionality. Recommended skills include proficiency in Android development (SDK, Studio, lifecycle), Java and Kotlin, Ethereum and smart contracts, web3j library, blockchain principles, problem-solving, version control with Git, and strong communication and collaboration abilities.
