# Description

Help stop climate change while learning more about web3, DLT, and smart contract development.  The [Climate Action and Accounting SIG (CA2SIG)](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CASIG/overview) has identified a number of use cases, including [Supply Chain Decarbonization](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CASIG/pages/19006065/Supply+Chain+Decarbonization) and [Reducing Methane Leakage and Flaring](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/events/pages/21792644/Reducing+Methane+Leakage+and+Flaring+through+Supply+Chain+Tokens), that could have significant positive climate impact.  In this mentorship, you will work with project leads and experienced developers to implement these use cases using data channels, smart contracts, DAO's, and blockchain oracles.  You will work with a variety of technologies, including Hyperledger Fabric, Besu, Ethereum, OrbitDB, and IPFS as well as web UI development including React and Node.js.

- [DAO](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CASIG/pages/19007052/DAO)

# Learning Objectives

You will learn about how to implement real life use cases using web3 technologies, including translating business processes into DLT transactions, token mechanisms, and web user interfaces. 

# Expected Outcome

Front end UI used to track carbon emissions in a supply chain

# Relation to Hyperledger

Hyperledger Fabric

Hyperledger Besu

# Education Level

User ready applications which implement the use cases mentioned above.

# Skills

web3 development: Ethereum, Solidity, Hyperledger Fabric and Besu

Front end development: Node.js and React

Databases

# Future plans

This will provide production-ready examples of Hyperledger platforms such as Fabric and Besu.  It will continue the development of key projects of the Climate Action and Accounting SIG and provide applications which would help the growth of the Supply Chain and Trade Finance SIG.  Finally it will bring positive brand benefits to Hyperledger through our work on climate change.
