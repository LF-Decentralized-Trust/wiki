# Hyperledger Mentorship Program : Learning Tokens for Hyperledger Community Building

Created by Alfonso Govela, last modified by Min Yu on Jun 07, 2024

**Project Title**Learning Tokens for Hyperledger Community Building**Status**

IN PROGRESS

**Primary Focus**

CODING DOCUMENTATION  RESEARCH

# Description

- **project scope**

<!--THE END-->

- - Employ Learning Tokens to register and certify attendance, learning scores, and engagement in Hyperledger Special Interest and Working Groups, Virtual Meetups and Workshops, Webinars of local Meetups, or Regional Chapters.
  - Document this experience for application in a future phase to Hyperledger projects use, collaboration, and maintenance.

<!--THE END-->

- **overall objectives**

<!--THE END-->

- - To reflect everyone’s engagement with proof of collaboration at every event.
  - To gather such proofs in skill wallets of expertise.
  - To match expertise profiles with the market demands for talent.
  - To provide KPIs for data-driven decision-making.

<!--THE END-->

- **problem/opportunity in need of effort**

<!--THE END-->

- - Open-source projects thrive in communities with transparent collaboration, active engagement, and shared knowledge. Formal courses and community events are vital for such purposes.However, although courses certify competencies, they lack a granular registry of skill acquisition, and community events, for the time being, have neither granular recognition of engagement nor formal proof of collaboration.

<!--THE END-->

- **probable implementation path to explore and fix the problem**
- - Learning Tokens provide a much-needed currency of expertise to represent the granularity of skill acquisition with an open-source mechanism that uses the composable Token Taxonomy Framework (TTF) of the InterWork Alliance Initiative (IWA) of the Global Blockchain Business Council (GBBC) to recognize, register, and certify skills acquisition and competencies while rewarding community engagement in collective learning.
  - Learning Tokens result of the Hyperledger Mentorship Program 2023, expands on the 2022 mentorship, and continues the work at the Hyperledger Lab with the same name.

<!--THE END-->

- **provide sufficient details**

<!--THE END-->

- - Learning Tokens are digital measurements of granular assessment: *Attendance Token* represents the value of being present, and *Score Token for Learners* represents the value of acquiring a unit of competency. *Help Tokens for Learners* represent the value of engagement in collaborative support, and *Score Tokens for Instructors* represent the value of their teaching performance.
- - Learning Tokens register Institution, Instructor, Course, and Learners. Its metadata records fields of knowledge and taxonomy of skills. (Look at README [https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/learning-tokens](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/learning-tokens))
- - The three main components of Learning Tokens are *Oracles*, a *Registry of Trust,* and *Skill Wallets*.
    
    - Scoring Guides are the oracle to assign tokens to learners.
    - A Registry of Trust supports the lifecycle and impact of tokens.
    - A Skill Wallet holds the tokens that certify a skill profile.

<!--THE END-->

- - We shall provide a template that Chairs of SIGs, WGs, or Coordinators of Virtual Meetups of Workshops, Regional Chapters, and local Meetups could use to define their different scoring guides and the metadata of the tokens for their events.
  - API integration with third-party services, Meetup, Zoom, and YouTube, shall provide the engagement data for creating and transferring Learning Tokens according to Scoring Guides.

# Learning Objectives

- Appreciate the relevance of community building for the open-source culture by interacting with all groups of Hyperledger.
- Understand the importance of employing granular units of competency for planning, conducting, measuring, and evaluating learning processes.
- Apply a research orientation and problem-solving capacity to generate multiple solutions.
- Grasp fundamentals of DLT, programming tools, data structures, personal privacy and governance principles.
- Use API integration of smart contracts.

# Expected Outcome and Deliverables
