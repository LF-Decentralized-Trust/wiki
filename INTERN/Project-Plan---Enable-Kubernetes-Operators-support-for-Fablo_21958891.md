# Hyperledger Mentorship Program : Project Plan - Enable Kubernetes Operators support for Fablo

Created by Umegbewe Nwebedu, last modified on Nov 29, 2022

## **Abstract**

Fablo is a tool to generate the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain network and run it on Docker. It's main goal is to provide a super-easy start with Hyperledger Fabric. It has a declarative approach - a whole network is described in a single file. Right now only the Docker environment is supported and we want add support for Kubertnetes Operators.

### **Project codebase:**

[https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/fablo](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/fablo)

**Outcomes:**

- Fablo is able to generate scripts and config files needed for kubernetes deployment

**Timeline:**

WeekDeliverablesStatusJune 1 - June 19

- Onboarding and documentation exercises
- Get high level understanding of Fablo codebase
- Read Documentation for hyperledger fabric operator
- Environment Setup

DoneJune 20 - June 30

- Use [https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/hlf-operator](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/hlf-operator) to set up a simple network on k8s. Network should contain:
  
  - two organizations (Orderer, Org1)
  - one Orderer named orderer0.orderer.example.com
  - two peers peer0.org1.example.com, peer1.org1.example.com both using LevelDb
  - one channel \`my-channel1\` that joins both peer
  - one chaincode \`chaincode1\` installed on \`my-channel1\` (we can provide sample one)
- Try to do the setup as a separate script, independent of Fablo generated files. We will connect them later.
- Try to list every component that Hyperledger offers (peers, orderers, ca's) and read about them. (we can provide useful links)

Done

July 1 - July 19

- Rewrite Fablo target scripts for the simplest network on Kubernetes operators (CAs, Orderers, Peers)
- **Learning part (by Mentor)**: Certificates. How they are used in Hyperledger, why they are so important, how they are implemented in k8s operators

doneJuly 20 - July 31

- Rewrite Fablo target scripts for the simplest network on Kubernetes operators (channels, chaincodes)
- **Learning part (by Mentor)**: How do we test Fablo using GitHub actions

doneAugust 1 - August 19

- Prepare templates for created scripts, similar to current templates for Docker

doneAugust 20 - August 31

- Write snapshot tests for templates for k8s

Septemeber 1 - September 19

- Add and test validation rules (for instance: TLS is not supported for k8s)

October 1 - October 19

- Investigate the possibility to support Fablo's advanced feat

  ures:
  
  - Orderer sharding
  - Chaincode upgrade
  - Snapshot/restore
  - Fablo REST
  - Channel query scripts

doneOctober 19 - October 31

- Investigate the possibility to support multi-tenant deployments (different clusters for orgs)

doneNovember 1 - November 12

- Verify all Fablo commands are properly supported: \`./fablo k8s generate|start|stop|up|down|chaincode|...\`
