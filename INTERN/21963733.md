# Hyperledger Mentorship Program : Project Plan - A fully distributed citizens pulse platform for state/city councils with Hyperledger Fabric

Created by Hritik Gupta, last modified by Emre Ayas on Aug 05, 2021

## Goal

To build a fully distributed citizens pulse platform for state/city councils using Hyperledger Fabric

## Deliverables

- An end-to-end working solution (Finland region):
  
  - Enrolled users are able to create topic, create comment, poll vote
  - Enrolled users are able to modify/delete one's own topic, comment, vote
- API Server
  
  - accepting incoming requests + delegating to Fabric
  - maintaining DB, Scheduler
- Client side: Web (React) and Mobile Application (Flutter)
- Adding functional tests to web components
- Github Actions
  
  - Adding CI, code coverage
  - Automating release cycles via versioning
- Documentation with diagrams on GitHub
