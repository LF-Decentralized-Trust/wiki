# Hyperledger Mentorship Program : The Giving Chain

Created by Bobbi Muscara, last modified by Min Yu on Nov 29, 2021

**Project Title**The Giving Chain**Status**

COMPLETED

**Difficulty**HIGH

# Description

The Giving Chain is a Social Impact project created by the Hyperledger Princeton Meetup. The Purpose of the project is to decentralize local charity giving by creating the Giving Chain and the R2D application. The application will use participants cell phones  to create an asset to be donated. The R2D (Recipient to Donor) then notifies the participant in the giving chain that an asset has been created and ready to be donated. The asset is then track till it is received by someone with need. This donation system lets donors track donation as well as creating a dignified way in which people can receive assistance.  

# Additional Information

The project made it to a proof of concept using the fish example in the sawtooth documentation.  It received an honorable mention at the Big Apps Blockchain challenge 2020, and won the GBA 2020 Social Impact Award 2020 .  [www.thegivingchain.org](http://www.thegivingchain.org) [www.bcprinceton.com](http://www.bcprinceton.com)
