# Hyperledger Mentorship Program : Migrate® where you already belong

Created by Jimmy Dorsey, last modified by Min Yu on Apr 06, 2023

**Project Title****Migrate® revolutionizes the home search by introducing neighbors to the buyers. Our ambition is to partner with brokerages and their agents as ambassadors to help connect neighbors to listings. We are using Hyperledger Aries mobile wallets to use Didcomm to chat about real estate.** **Status**

CODING

# Description

Home buyers have no way of searching out the neighbors before making the largest purchase of their life. Neighbors have no way of digitally influencing who buys in their community. Realtors have limited ways to employ the community in the home selling process. Real estate CRM's promise to notify of user activity but that activity is sold to real estate platforms. Buyers have never been able to list themselves for a reverse search on a real estate MLS. Our app provides a solution to all of these problems and more. 

# Additional Information

Go to JimmyDorseyRealEstate.com to read about how a brokerage is using the MigrateApp currently to connect neighbors to listings and revolutionize the real estate sales process. Go to MigrateApp.org or download the app on the app store to get an Aries Wallet and credential to talk to neighbors of listed properties (only in NW Oregon and SW Washington currently)

# Learning Objectives

- The mentee will learn about the use of verifiable credentials in the context of real-world applications.
- The mentee will gain experience in contributing to an open-source project and working with a team remotely.
- The mentee will develop their programming skills by working with various technologies, such as JSON-LD, Python, and API development.
- The mentee will grow their understanding of machine learning and natural language processing by working with OpenAI's GPT-3 API.
- The mentee will have the opportunity to gain insights into the real estate industry by working with Migrate's platform and contributing to its development.

# Expected Outcome

Unlike neighbors which have to be online to talk, the Neighborhood Expert is always available to chat with. The Neighborhood Expert acts as a concierge that knows everything about the area and also interacts with other neighbors. The Expert is built on a system which is focused on the facts and details of a specific geographic area.

- The Expert will answer questions about the neighborhood and return information in a conversational style
- The answers will be simple or detailed depending on what the user wants
- Conversations with the Neighborhood Expert will persist even after app restarts, so the user can pick up where they left off.
- Facts about the area, home prices, schools, weather, recreational opportunities, shopping and commercial offerings will be pulled in from open-source databases and digested by the Expert.
- The Expert will return information in a conversational style, while paying attention to new questions or needs of the user.
- In future versions of the app we will have the Neighborhood Expert save information selected by the users onto their Google or Drop Box drive. This could be specific data such as maps, tables, charts and highlighted answers (”save this” highlighter) for the user to keep and refer to, or pass along to other interested parties.

# Relation to Hyperledger

The Migrate app is a real estate application that offers familiar features such as browsing listings, managing documents, and searching for properties. It is developed using React Native for cross-platform compatibility and comes with a blockchain-enabled Migrate Wallet that securely stores and transmits data, credentials, and digital assets. The Migrate Wallet uses a decentralized identity protocol based on the Hyperledger Aries project, which provides users with ownership and control of their data, as well as the ability to verify data validity. Migrate Wallet users can exchange information through JDRE's implementation of the DIDComm protocol, and the exchanged data is only available to the users involved in the exchange. The Migrate Wallet is built using the Hyperledger Indy project and a blockchain-based distributed ledger called VON. The Migrate platform's architecture is designed to be scalable using cloud-based infrastructure, and its containerized applications increase the available software developer pool. The Migrate app offers seamless integration of advanced technology, ensuring the security and integrity of exchanged information without disrupting the user experience.

# Mentee Skills

Developers working on the Migrate App would need to have a strong foundation in software development, specifically in mobile development and blockchain technology. Here are some specific skills:

1. Mobile development: The Migrate App is developed using React Native, a framework for building mobile apps that can run on both iOS and Android platforms. A developer would need to have experience within this framework to be able to work on the app.
2. Blockchain development: Hyperledger is a blockchain framework, so a developer would need to have knowledge and experience in blockchain development to be able to work on the Migrate App and Hyperledger. This would include understanding blockchain concepts such as consensus algorithms, smart contracts, and decentralized applications.
3. Hyperledger frameworks: A developer would need to have experience with Hyperledger frameworks such as Hyperledger Indy and Hyperledger Aries, which are used in the Migrate App. They would need to be familiar with the Hyperledger architecture and its components, such as the Hyperledger Fabric and Hyperledger Ursa.
4. Backend development: The Migrate App also has a backend infrastructure that is designed to be scalable using cloud-based infrastructure. A developer would need to have experience with backend development, including developing APIs and working with databases.
5. Containerization: The Migrate App is designed to be containerized, so a developer would need to be familiar with containerization technologies such as Docker and Kubernetes.
6. Security: Security is a critical aspect of the Migrate App, so a developer would need to have experience with security best practices and technologies such as encryption and secure communication protocols.
7. Collaboration: Working on the Migrate App and Hyperledger would require collaboration with other developers and stakeholders, so a developer would need to have good communication and collaboration skills. They would also need to be able to work effectively in a team environment and be able to adapt to changing requirements and priorities.
8. Any experience with the OpenAi Api would be welcome.

# Future plans

We are seeking a 4 Million dollar Venture Capital investment 

- We are creating a platform to sell data not just houses
- This investment would be used to create the UX with a focus on social interactions between parties in a real estate transaction including the neighbors.
- We are looking for team members who know how to party, play drums or are looking to buy or sell.
