### Completed Work

Created a Hyperledger Labs Project - [https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/benchmarking-cross-chain-bridges](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/benchmarking-cross-chain-bridges)

and a companion GitBook that explains how to setup and use the project - [https://benchmarking-aggregators.gitbook.io/benchmarking-cross-chain-bridges/](https://benchmarking-aggregators.gitbook.io/benchmarking-cross-chain-bridges/)

and the report/paper that was generated - [https://www.techrxiv.org/users/687326/articles/697988-benchmarking-bridge-aggregators?access\_token=\_CKaHPE2j7yeGUr0dOzYag](https://www.techrxiv.org/users/687326/articles/697988-benchmarking-bridge-aggregators?access_token=_CKaHPE2j7yeGUr0dOzYag)

We are also going to work on it by adding some more aggregators and even publish a paper in the future!

### What we did

- The Project was about creating a benchmarking framework for blockchain aggregators – Token Bridge Aggregators, Token Pool Aggregators, On-chain liquidity Aggregators, and Cross-chain Message Aggregators.
- We did so by performing a theoretical analysis of each of the aggregators by diving into their GitHub, developer documentations, and blog posts.
- We then created scripts that interact with these aggregators by querying for routes, handling these routes, and executing the routes.
- We also created a standardized benchmarking schema to analyze the heterogenous aggregator routes for fee, latency, downtime, etc.
- We also created testing scripts for these aggregators along with custom data types. The tests found results that were inconsistent with the aggregator developer docs and those were reported on the aggregators discord.
- We also constantly upgraded our benchmarking with aggregator upgrades. Hyperlane, CCIP, and Hashi upgraded during the course of the mentorship and we benchmarked the older and new versions and discussed the differences in the report.

### Statistics across the mentorship

- 8000+ lines of code across 300 commits.
- Data collected over a 3 day period covering 6 token aggregators and 3 message aggregators.
- 40 pages in-depth report
- Modular and upgradable benchmarking script where anyone can contribute new modules for aggregators
- Standardized framework for analyzing heterogeneous aggregators
- 50+ calls with mentors.

### What I learned

- How to analyze projects from a researcher point of view
- Host a maintainable repository
- Create a standardized framework for benchmarking

Thanks a lot to my mentors Andre and Rafael for being the best and always being there to help me with problems both in and outside the mentorship. Their guidance through creating the report and constant feedback on how to improve helped accelerate my development as a young developer and they were fantastic people always there to help and support me.

### Blog Post:
