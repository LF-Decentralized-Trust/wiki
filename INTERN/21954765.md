# Hyperledger Mentorship Program : Project Plan - Extend secure DID Registry for Hyperledger frameworks on Github/GitLab

Created by Wei Yao, last modified on Nov 23, 2021

**DRAFT**

**Goals :**

Complete a command-Line utility to automate the process of creating a DID Registry for the members of organizations utilizing Github/Gitlab as Verifiable Credential Registry, On-boarding organizations, and features for easy management. The extend project should includes proper test cases, documentations, and codebase maintained with proper read me document.

**Timeline:**

**This is the initial level RoadMap and it is subjected to change depending upon the progress of work and any design changes introduced during the course of work.**

**Schedule**

**Activity**

**Deliverables**

**First Quarterly Evaluation**

- Warm up by Project Setup - DRman( [https://github.com/DIDman/DRman](https://github.com/DIDman/DRman))
- Check up with the progress of previous project
- Explore DRM commands
- Explore VC Registry (Check W3C standard documents)
- Explore Hyperledger Aries Project (roughly)
  
- Explore a set of GitHub API involved
  
- Explore DID repository
- Procedure to create a repository for a Github/Non-Github organization

<!--THE END-->

- Project plan
- Learn more about Aries Ecosystem
- Architecture of the DID ecosystem which includes VCR and DRman, includes use cases.
  
- A list of GitHub API involved

**Second Quarterly Evaluation**

- Drafting the Skeleton Code Base
- Skeleton Code Base - Review
- DID Registry Creation Script - Draft Iteration
- Explore Hyperledger Aries Project (in detail)
  

<!--THE END-->

- Make a script to create a dummy GitHub repo
- RF-0.0.1:Drm command to create a GitHub repository
- RF-0.0.4: Command to install a Aries VCR

**Third Quarterly Evaluation**

- Independent Executable Script
- Extended architecture - Implementation
- Architecural Discussion
- Review

<!--THE END-->

- Github Based VCR Creation (done?)
  
- Github Based VCR Onboarding and Management
  
- RF-0.0.2:enable/restrict access to users of the repository
- RF-0.0.3:API to add/update/revoke access DID’s or (DID Documents)

**Fourth Quarterly Evaluation**

- Authentication Part
- DID Registry - Final Version Evaluation
- Review -&gt; Bug Fix -&gt; Review
- Documentation
- Project conclusion
- Demo

<!--THE END-->

- Github Based VCR
  
- Proper test cases and documentations
- Final presentation

**Question Lists :**

- DID repository in the architecture.
  
- Is DRMan similar to Hyperledger Ursa program?
- What is the main purpose to research BCGov?
- Combine with other Hyperledger projects, such as Indy, Ursa, and etc.

## **Communication**

- Quarter basis review according to Hyperledger Internship Programme schedule
- Internal communication and updates:
- - Whatsapp/Email for communication
- Weekly zoom call with mentors for project updates
