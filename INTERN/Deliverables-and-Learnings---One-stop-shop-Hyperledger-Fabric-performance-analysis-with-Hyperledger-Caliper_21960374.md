## **Learnings**

The development of this project can be segmented into three crucial phases:

1. **Analysis of Fabric Logs**
   
   Before I started working on creating a performance analysis tool, I decided to dig into a bunch of Hyperledger Fabric logs. This was my first time diving into this kind of research, making it quite exciting. I explored different versions and configurations, checking out things like whether there was a peer gateway or not. My goal was to pinpoint the crucial log lines that I needed to include in our service. It turned out to be a fascinating journey, and I learned a lot about the inner workings of Fabric during this process.
2. **Development of Logstash Pipelines**
   
   In the next step, I set up an input log pipeline to direct logs to their respective pipelines. This was also my first exposure to setting up a Docker service. I then created separate pipelines for each service, like one for peer and another for orderer, to handle specific logs. Additionally, I delved into log processing with Logstash and interacted with the ELK stack. After preprocessing and adding necessary tags, I stored the logs in a CouchDB database for future retrieval. This phase not only taught me about log processing, but also provided valuable insights into working with Logstash and other ELK services.
3. **Development of Python Script for Performance Analysis and Visualization**
   
   In the final phase, I developed a Python script to fetch and structure the logs. The script not only conducted performance analysis but also presented the information visually.
