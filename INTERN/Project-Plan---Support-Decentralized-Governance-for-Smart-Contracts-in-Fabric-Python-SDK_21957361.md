# Hyperledger Mentorship Program : Project Plan - Support Decentralized Governance for Smart Contracts in Fabric Python SDK

Created by Dixing Xu, last modified by Kiven Chen on Dec 07, 2021

## Goals

Fabric-SDK-Py is the Python 3.6+ implementation of Hyperledger Fabric SDK. This project aims to add support for new lifecycle management of chaincode as in Fabric 2.x

Through the course of the project, Fabric-SDK-Py v2 a long-term support (LTS) version will be released which supports Fabric 2.x.

## Timeline

The tentative timeline is as follows:

Week

Deliverables

Week 1 - Week 6 

- Understanding chaincode lifecycle management and features that have not yet been implemented for compatibility with Fabric 2.x.
- Revise channel function and compability in sdk.
- Review the documentation for the existing code and make appropriate changes.

Week 7 - Week 12

- Implement APIs for chaincode lifecycle management
- Implement the remaining features for the release of Fabric Python SDK 2.0 LTS.

Week 13 - Week 18

- Add chaincode examples with new APIs
- Update documentations and unittest cases

Week 19 - Week 24

- Complete implementation of the possible features for compatibility with 2.0.
- Document the newly implemented features.These are certain deviations from the original project plan

Newly opened issues will also be resolved during the course of the project.

## Methodology

- Review and evaluation will be done on a quarterly basis as mentioned in the Program Timeline.
- All communications between the mentee and mentors will be done through rocket chat and bi-weekly meetings over zoom.

## Result

Updated Fabric Python SDK documentations: [https://fabric-sdk-py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/](https://fabric-sdk-py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
