# Hyperledger Mentorship Program : Project Plan - Add interactive examples to Fabric Python SDK

Created by Rohan Shrothrium, last modified on Nov 18, 2020

## Goals

Fabric-SDK-Py is the Python 3.x implementation of Hyperledger Fabric SDK. This project aims to add the missing functionalities to the SDK such that it supports Fabric v1.4.x.

Through the course of the project, Fabric-SDK-Py v1.0.0 a long-term support (LTS) version will be released and we will also start working on support for Fabric 2.x. The project also aims to add interactive examples to Fabric-SDK-Py using Jupyter notebook so that the new developers get a more detailed understanding of how to use the fabric SDK.

## Timeline

The tentative timeline is as follows:

Week

Deliverables

Week 1 - Week 6 

- Understanding features that have not yet been implemented for compatibility with Fabric 1.4.x.
- Complete the implementation of the Contract class.
- Integrate the Wallets with the Gateway.
- Review the documentation for the existing code and make appropriate changes.

Week 7 - Week 12

- Implement higher-level APIs for Invoking and Querying the ledger in Fabric-Network.
- Implement the remaining features for the release of Fabric Python SDK 1.0.0 LTS.
- Document the newly implemented features.

Week 13 - Week 18

- Add interactive examples using Jupyter Notebook.
- Understand new features of the chaincode lifecycle in Fabric 2.0 release.

Week 19 - Week 24

- Complete implementation of the possible features for compatibility with 2.0.
- Document the newly implemented features.These are certain deviations from the original project plan
- Add sample code.
- Change unittest cases to Raft ordering

Newly opened issues will also be resolved during the course of the project.

## Methodology

- Review and evaluation will be done on a quarterly basis as mentioned in the Program Timeline.
- All communications between the mentee and mentors will be done through rocket chat and bi-weekly meetings over zoom.

## Result

The final report can be found below.
