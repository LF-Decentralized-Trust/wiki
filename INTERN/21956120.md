**Difficulty**

MEDIUM  

# Description

Blockchain is helpful for collaborative applications, however, it is difficult to manage because of the decentralized features. Another challenge is how to efficiently govern a blockchain network among various organizations.

Hyperledger Cello is aiming to resolve the following challenges, 1) Facilitate creation of blockchain network, can help user without blockchain background to setup their network quickly. 2) Security, need to implement mechanism to protect key pairs. 3) Cross organization communication, can connect blockchain networks among multiple organizations. This project targets to design and implement a practical operational system equipping with decentralized functionalities to solve above challenges, based on Hyperledger Cello code base.

# Additional Information
