**Title**HSM support update, client side keystore signing, keystore model**Status**

PROJECT COMPLETED

**Difficulty**

MEDIUM

# Description

This project aims to improve fabric sdk node security modules with following issues

- HSM has been supported and documented in Nodejs sdk , but not all OS platform and HSM providers are under test coverage.
  
- KeyStore model are suffering from an ugly model design that not recommended in ES6+ code convention.
  
- Offline client signing is supported in Nodejs SDK. New sample or even general common module of fabric client signing is needed in form of like fabric-android-keystore or fabric-web-keystore
  

# Additional Information

- Client signing design doc: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gj5XB7yS-pfjpvZEUQh5lBGSIE6aQemu8A69tAYQtTc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gj5XB7yS-pfjpvZEUQh5lBGSIE6aQemu8A69tAYQtTc)
- Refactor keystore model issue: https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/24749/

# Learning Objectives

- Establish connection with Nodejs SDK, fabric CI communities and contributors
- Cyber security algorithm hands-on experience
- Understand the basic workflow of fabric
- Being able to implement features for SDK
- Application level thinking in design common module and sample.

# Expected Outcome

- update HSM integration test
- update HSM document
- project fabric-client-keystore
