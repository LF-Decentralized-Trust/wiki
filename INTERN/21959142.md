**Milestones: (A quarter is every six weeks with ~20hr work week)**

1. Q1:
2. 1. Be hands-on with Weaver asset exchange
   2. Complete literature survey on HTLC, fair exchange and distributed fault-tolerance
   3. Design proposal for fault-tolerant asset exchange between two Fabric networks in Weaver.
3. Q2:
4. 1. Build the protocol for fault-tolerant asset exchange between two Fabric networks
   2. Design proposal for fault-tolerant asset exchange between different combinations Corda and Besu networks in Weaver.
5. Q3:
6. 1. Build the protocol for Corda and Besu
7. Q4:
8. 1. Design and build the protocol for automated asset exchange (or)
   2. Start writing a research paper with a formal analysis of our protocol on fault-tolerant asset exchange if we find enough novelty wrt state of art.

Week 1

Hands-on with Weaver asset exchange:

- Setup Fabric, Corda, Besu test networks
- Understand the basic HTLC protocol
- Test Weaver implementations of asset exchange
- **Weaver Documentation:** [https://labs.hyperledger.org/weaver-dlt-interoperability/docs/external/getting-started/guide/](https://labs.hyperledger.org/weaver-dlt-interoperability/docs/external/getting-started/guide/)
  
  - - Follow the documentation step-by-step (ie: Testnet first, etc. and then asset exchange example)
- **Asset Exchange Example (Fabric/Fabric + Fabric/Corda):** [https://labs.hyperledger.org/weaver-dlt-interoperability/docs/external/getting-started/interop/asset-exchange/](https://labs.hyperledger.org/weaver-dlt-interoperability/docs/external/getting-started/interop/asset-exchange/)
- **Data Sharing (we will do this later, so start now):** [https://labs.hyperledger.org/weaver-dlt-interoperability/docs/external/getting-started/interop/data-sharing](https://labs.hyperledger.org/weaver-dlt-interoperability/docs/external/getting-started/interop/data-sharing)

Week 2 (Compute Heavy)

1. Some papers to start reading: 
   
   1. MAD-HTLC
   
   <!--THE END-->
   
   1. Cross-chain Deals and Adversarial Commerce
   2. Atomic Cross-Chain Swaps
   3. Atomic Commitment vs Optionality
2. Propose **fault models** that are feasible to protect against in a cross-chain atomic swap (builds upon set 1)
3. 1. Fault model archetypes/schemas will be acquired as you read papers
   2. Make a master list of all fault models and then shortlist what is realistic
   3. Get feedback from slack based on what constitutes a fault model
   4. **NOTE**: Cryptography definitions may vary regarding fault models and/or their properties
4. Run 2x Fabric Networks + 1x Corda Network (Corda is **MEMORY HEAVY**) on the VM + 1x Besu test network + test Weaver implementation
5. 1. 1 pair of networks (ideally fabric/fabric) is sufficient to test #3
6. Project Plan on HLF Project Page (just timeline; 24 weeks total/6 weeks per quarter, 4 quarters total)
7. Set up remote access to your tower
8. Fix Zenhub ticket reporting issue

Week 3 (Mobile/Research Heavy)

1. (In-meeting) Review papers and establish consensus on critical semantics
2. Determine abstractions for fault-models
3. Review paper #3

Week 4 

1. (In-meeting) Review papers and establish consensus on critical semantics
2. Determine abstractions for fault-models
3. Review paper #3

Week 5 

1. Discussion of importance of two-phase commit; fundamental basis of other interoperability options (cross-chain swaps, cross-chain deals, etc.)
2. Discussion on further refining fault model

Week 6 

1. Discussion on further defining fault-model
2. Discussion on Cross-Chain payments with success guarantees, formalized model of verifiably correct cross-chain swaps

Week 7 

1. Finish discussion on formalized model of verifiably correct cross-chain swaps

Week 8 

1. Acquire critique on current protocol for fault-tolerant cross-chain swaps

Week 9 

1. Iterate on current protocol to refine security guarantees

Week 10 

1. Finalize v1.0 of Byzantine Swaps: our current Byzantine Fault Tolerant HTLC Protocol
2. Determine features to utilize to solve key problems, involving but not limited to:
3. 1. Weak Denial-Of-Service (DoS) problem
   2. Strong Formal Guarantees (Atomicity, Safety, Liveness)

Week 11 

1. Architectural call on how to implement specific facets of protocol atop Hyperledger Weaver’s features
2. Where to look regarding files to modify for Fault-Tolerant Hyperledger Fabric + R3 Corda Asset Swap
