# Cloud Compatibility Certification : Project Plan

Created by Silona Bonewald, last modified on Oct 31, 2019

Note: Part I (determining the framework and specific details of the Project’s Conformance Program) should be the first step. Parts II and III can often run concurrently with one another.

Note: “Responsible Party” column describes who the core decision-makers typically are for the given task; however, LF personnel and others are typically involved in most aspects of these discussions. Involvement of e.g. LF Legal counsel will vary depending on project (for example, separately-incorporated projects typically have their own separate legal counsel).
