## Discussion

1. Quarterly report (if anyone has any feedback/change request on it, otherwise this is a no-op)
2. Peter's apology for going slower than expected with the issuance of the release we talked about a couple of weeks ago
   
   1. a chain of dependencies were uncovered and a bug with the automated release management pipeline is in the mix as well and I want to fix that problem before issuing the new release
3. [竹内琢磨](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/70121:99daf5c8-226c-43d4-9f24-0a46a0546192?ref=confluence) About PR1942 [https://github.com/hyperledger/cactus/pull/1942](https://github.com/hyperledger/cactus/pull/1942)
   
   1. We have not heard from the contributor, but it is an important change, so I want to fix the syntax error.
4. Ad-hoc topics
