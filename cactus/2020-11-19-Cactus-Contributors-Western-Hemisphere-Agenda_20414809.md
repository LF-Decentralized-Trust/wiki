## Announcements

## Discussion

1. Demo of the new Cactus Fabric All-in-One Docker image that is powered by DinD (Docker in Docker)
   
   1. It uses the excellent Fabric Samples github repo to pull up the ledger
   2. Pro: Can pull up an entire Fabric ledger (10+ containers) running embedded within a single container
   3. Pro: Can run multiple fabric ledgers on the same machine in parallel (randomized host ports will be picked by Docker automatically)
   4. Pro: Alpine based, much thinner image than the Ubuntu based ones
   5. Pro: Configurable Fabric version
   6. Pro: Comes with a built-in health check which polls for one of the example contracts actually responding to queries which
   7. Con: Takes more than 60 seconds from container start to passing the health check (e.g. when ledger is fully booted up)
2. Academic Paper Discussion (#4)
