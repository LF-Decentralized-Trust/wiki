**How to Join**

1. Join the Hyperledger Foundation Discord Server: [https://discord.gg/invite/hyperledger](https://discord.gg/invite/hyperledger) (10 AM Pacific Time)
2. Locate the channel category called **Cacti**
3. Within that category, locate the voice channel called **general** as seen on the screenshot below.
4. If your microphone doesn't work or for whatever reason you cannot do a voice call, just post your question on the chat instead and make sure to tag the group called **@Cacti Maintainer** in your message so that the maintainers (who are most likely to know the answer to your question) get a notification about the message!
