# Hyperledger Cacti : Draft: Quarter report of 2022 Q4 Hyperledger Cacti

Created by 竹内琢磨, last modified by Venkatraman Ramakrishna on Jan 11, 2023

\# 2022 Q4 Hyperledger Cactus

\## Project Health  
\- Cactus and Weaver were merged to one project "Cacti."  The maintainers almost completed the first code merge and will release the first Cacti v2-alpha (tentative name) in Q1 2023.  
\- The maintainers are also discussing the new architecture of Cacti toward Cacti-V2 in order to combine the strengths of the original Cactus and Weaver to achieve a more flexible interoperability tool.  
\- Cacti has newly supported the interoperability with Iroha V2 and Ubiquity SDK.  
\- Weaver now supports organizational identity syncing and event pub/sub across Fabric networks, and atomic swaps involving ERC-standard tokens in Besu networks with Fabric and Corda networks.

\## Required Information  
1\. Have you switched from master to main in all your repos? \*\*Yes\**  
2\. Have you implemented the Common Repository Structure in all your repos? \*\*Yes\**

    - support features:  
        - \[update] support multiple business-logic-plugins in the single server  
            - [https://github.com/hyperledger/cactus/commit/0f670855b0fa0fd33f71bf5a1814fb6fcac2c7b6](https://github.com/hyperledger/cactus/commit/0f670855b0fa0fd33f71bf5a1814fb6fcac2c7b6)  
2\. Major Weaver updates as merged pull requests  
    - ERC-token support for Besu networks engaging in asset swaps  
        - [https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/weaver-dlt-interoperability/pull/299](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/weaver-dlt-interoperability/pull/299)

3\. Created a draft architecture diagram for Cacti as a fusion of Cactus and Weaver, with the goal of providing a flexible or customizable interoperability toolkit  
    - The architecture has been brushed-up among weekly maintainer calls.  This will be started to be referred on the next release (Cacti V2-beta on Q1-Q2)  
    - The architectural evolution is called out in two distinct phases:  
         - A common platform and toolkit with Cactus and Weaver modules and libraries coexisting and solving similar purposes  
         - An integrated platform and toolkit with similar-purpose modules and libraries from Cactus and Weaver fused into common Cacti modules and libraries

\# Current Plans  
1\. Release plan:  
    - Cacti V2-alpha (Q1): The first proto version of Cacti combining the original Cactus and Weaver  
    - Cacti V2-beta (Q1-Q2): The first version of Cacti based on the new architecture (combined with the strengths of Cactus and Weaver)  
2\. Other features:  
    - Cacti Transaction GUI feature (Q1)  
    - DID registry-based identity management for cross-network data sharing  
    - Automated relay-based asset swaps using cross-network events  
    - Supporting data sharing (with proof generation and validation) in for Fabric PDCs  
    - Supporting data sharing (with proof generation and validation) in Besu networks  
3\. Standardization:  
    - Track the Secure Asset Transfer (SAT) group's efforts toward forming an official IETF Working Group  
      - If it becomes an official WG, influence and comply (i.e., in Cacti code) with protocol drafts (eventually RFCs) for interoperability standards
