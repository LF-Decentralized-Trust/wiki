 20 Private Transactions

Discussed as part of the presentation showed by [Rafael Belchior](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/712020:0476fdbd-25a2-41d4-9ba2-27de7ea0f715?ref=confluence)

- Even the definition of privacy is difficult to nail down
- PDO, SGX, TEE
- Traffic analysis: likely impossible to fully guard against (at the end of the day we all
  
  exist in the same universe and are therefore our actions/existence is observable at a certain scale no matter what)
- Hiding transaction semantics: We have  a shot here at providing some level of privacy
- Model proposal - security properties
  
  - Atomicity
  - Consistency
  - Durability
  - Containment of side effects
  - Liveness (proposed to be added by [Hart Montgomery](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/712020:86f447c0-86dc-43b3-ac03-6a31923bbb84?ref=confluence)

## Action items

- [Peter Somogyvari](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/557058:54be3a11-ffe8-43a5-b37d-c854a0aa21c3?ref=confluence)to create a GitHub issue tracking the moonshot feature mentioned by Claudio: A top level abstraction layer allowing business logic/cross ledger transaction issuance by simply writing a special flavor of SQL/DSL where ledgers can be treated as separate database schemas, tables can be like smart contract states and individual state entries can be like database rows. This is obviously a very ambitious, lofty goal that is most likely impossible to implement in a useful capacity. To observe the latter one just needs to take a look at the failures of most traditional ORM libraries that are out there claiming to abstract away relational database differences (despite with those the differences being mostly just syntax not mechanics)
