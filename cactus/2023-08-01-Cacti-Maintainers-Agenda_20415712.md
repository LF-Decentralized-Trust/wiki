## Recording

## Discussion

1. **gRPC legacy versions elimination due to performance and security considerations** (it's no longer receiving ANY updates so we cannot release 2.0.0-GA with the legacy gRPC versions due to that)
   
   1. build(deps): fix npm (grpc) build on NodeJS v20.4.0#2562 =&gt; [https://github.com/hyperledger/cacti/issues/2562](https://github.com/hyperledger/cacti/issues/2562)
   2. Work in progress pull request (build is broken due to Fabric 1.x to 2.x upgrades: [https://github.com/hyperledger/cacti/pull/2563](https://github.com/hyperledger/cacti/pull/2563)
   3. Other issue I opened earlier with basically the same goal: uild(deps): upgrade dependencies, especially grpc #1507 =&gt; [https://github.com/hyperledger/cacti/issues/1507](https://github.com/hyperledger/cacti/issues/1507)
2. PR review: [https://github.com/hyperledger/cacti/pull/2296](https://github.com/hyperledger/cacti/pull/2296)
3. Applying for Graduated status
4. Any other ad-hoc discussion topics
