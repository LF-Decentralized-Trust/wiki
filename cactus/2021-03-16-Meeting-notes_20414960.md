## Discussion items

- (1) Requirements for releasing v0.4
  
  - when - the date to announce
    
    - by the end of March due to developing Verifier enhanced
  - how - Marking tag is not enough, posting an article on Hyperledger Blog?
    
    - agreed about Hyperledger Blog among maintainers.
  - Hart will start to negotiate with Hyperledger marketing people.
    
    - what - ledger plugins with the documentation for developers to evaluate. Clarify the relationship with example apps.
- (2) The PRs about README (PR637, 642)
  
  - examples, demo image (GIF) should be separated to sub directory.
  - LedgerPlugin should be built separately. So we need to rethink about building process (decision tree) so that the process includes both process of lerna and LedgerPlugin.
  - Takuma will post on both PRs about the above points.
- (3) Upcoming quarterly project update
  
  - by the end of March
  - Hart will help the project update.
- (4) (ad-hoc1): future planning towards releasing v1
  
  - We should enhance this project for developers who develop another LedgerPlugin for a new ledger.
    
    - e.g.) Current Cactus needs for developers to use specific version of software (e.g. node.js, ...), the situation seems to be too heavy on developers.
  - We should prepare for docker container or another solution independent with software version on local machine.
    
    - c.f. Issue #504 - agreed by every maintainers.
- (5) Ad-hoc topics
  
  - PR587 - move to extension about ledger-specific feature like HTLC. Separate into smart contract of HTLC
  - Takuma will post on PR587 about adding getSmartContractList according to whitepaper 5.3.2
