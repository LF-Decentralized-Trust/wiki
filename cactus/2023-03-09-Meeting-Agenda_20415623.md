## Announcements

## Discussion

We should discuss the current roadmap for the Cactus-Weaver integration within Cacti as outlined in [https://github.com/hyperledger/cacti/blob/main/ROADMAP.md#cacti-v2](https://github.com/hyperledger/cacti/blob/main/ROADMAP.md#cacti-v2).

For targets to fulfil within March, here is a tentative proposal:

- A complete merger of the Github workflows and packages published in a consistent way (names and versions) in a common namespace.
- Adding API interfaces and functions to select a mode of cross-network interaction/transaction: node server or relay
- Creating an end-to-end sample flow that fulfills a particular use case (ledger state sharing, asset swap) using either of the two above modes, which can be triggered on demand from a client app.
- We can write some tutorial documentation around the above. This may also serve the purpose of demonstrating that we are ready for graduation. (We can them commence with the deeper integration tasks involving fusing the api-client and SDKs, creating common connectors, and creating the common smart contracts plus ledger interfaces called out in the architecture diagram).

Let us also discuss whether the above tasks would qualify us to make a pitch for Cacti to be a graduated project, and if not, what other tasks we should complete (and by when).Â
