00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.079
Peter Somogyvari: Hey, Sandy? Sorry for being late.

2
00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.810
sandeep: hey? Hi!

3
00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:51.600
Peter Somogyvari: And also I

4
00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.490
Peter Somogyvari: did not have time to create an agenda. Let me. Just

5
00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:59.890
Peter Somogyvari: great one. Right?

6
00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:04.790
sandeep: Okay.

7
00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:11.980
Peter Somogyvari: I am in technical.

8
00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.140
Peter Somogyvari: And that

9
00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.100
Peter Somogyvari: actually

10
00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:23.029
Peter Somogyvari: add a few things to discuss just quick ones.

11
00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.900
Peter Somogyvari: Oh, yeah, the pool request

12
00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:29.640
sandeep:  yeah.

13
00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:35.709
Peter Somogyvari: the second pull request about that fix that I made.

14
00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.369
Peter Somogyvari: or the open Api generator

15
00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.380
Peter Somogyvari: the way through to download.

16
00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.400
sandeep: Yeah, I think it got merged right.

17
00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.200
Peter Somogyvari: It did. Thanks for merging it, but it had a bug.

18
00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:54.870
sandeep: Oh, okay.

19
00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:03.460
Peter Somogyvari: it it was so silly of me. There was a race condition in the bug fix for the race condition classes.

20
00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.560
Peter Somogyvari:  let me share my screen.

21
00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:14.530
Peter Somogyvari: Hey? Rama.

22
00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:18.840
Ramakrishna V: hey?

23
00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:20.500
Peter Somogyvari: No problem

24
00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.440
Peter Somogyvari: share screen.

25
00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:33.669
Peter Somogyvari: Can you see my screen?

26
00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.920
sandeep: Yeah.

27
00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.739
Peter Somogyvari: alright. So then we can start the actual meeting.

28
00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:47.249
Peter Somogyvari: Hello, and welcome everyone to the Maintainer's Meeting. We abide by the anti-school policy. Notice that I'm showing on the screen

29
00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:54.529
Peter Somogyvari: and also the Hyper ledger code of conduct which is linked to you from the agenda document which

30
00:03:54.770 --> 00:04:00.430
Peter Somogyvari: I just created about 10Â s ago. But it's important to have it, because then we can

31
00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.630
Peter Somogyvari: document the meeting.

32
00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:08.310
Peter Somogyvari: So the one thing I had

33
00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:15.359
Peter Somogyvari: his well, 2 things, thanks for the Pr reviews, and the other one is that

34
00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:27.989
Peter Somogyvari: I had to sneak in a second fix to my previous fix to the concurrency issue with the Chore downloads.

35
00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.560
Peter Somogyvari: and so the

36
00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:37.110
Peter Somogyvari: all requests that I submitted

37
00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:42.459
Peter Somogyvari: to fix a docker container issue.

38
00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:47.729
Peter Somogyvari: Yeah, share this. yeah. So here's the.

39
00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:52.999
Peter Somogyvari: here's the fix. I basically just made it so that

40
00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:59.709
Peter Somogyvari: it deletes the open Api to straighten file once, and it forces it so that

41
00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:05.179
Peter Somogyvari: even if it fails to delete because of whatever reasons, it doesn't fail

42
00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:10.510
Peter Somogyvari: the process itself. So what will this now put together?

43
00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:20.259
Peter Somogyvari: The code generation task should be parallel to running, but it should not have race conditions. And then the actual pull request

44
00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:24.000
Peter Somogyvari: just about upgrading the fabric images.

45
00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:30.439
Peter Somogyvari: but yeah. So the the reason I'm talking about all this is because

46
00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:46.060
Peter Somogyvari: I had to modify the commit message to say that also sneaking the hard fix, and also because I'm asking for reviews on this in an expedited manner, just because it has a bug fixed that

47
00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:54.130
Peter Somogyvari: hopefully makes the cr it more stable, which is something that we desperately need, because it's been a

48
00:05:55.170 --> 00:06:05.429
Peter Somogyvari: slowing down progress a lot. Just the fact that the Ci takes too long, and then it has to be retried a bunch of times. But it fails with false negatives.

49
00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:07.940
sandeep: Yeah.

50
00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:14.799
Peter Somogyvari: I don't know.

51
00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:17.330
sandeep: Yeah.

52
00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:23.049
Peter Somogyvari: yeah, so that's a lie. Head

53
00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:36.060
sandeep:  RAM, I, you had some questions about adding the interns to be reported.

54
00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:38.710
Ramakrishna V: oh,

55
00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:52.889
Ramakrishna V: yeah, just for that, just wanted to say that I'm working on the documentation so made some progress. Not yet, it should go. But I should have something to show you pretty soon.

56
00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:57.000
Peter Somogyvari: That sounds great. Thank you.

57
00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:03.479
Ramakrishna V: and yeah on the interns so

58
00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:05.850
Ramakrishna V: how do we

59
00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:11.730
Ramakrishna V: like do the interns have to join the hypothesis organization.

60
00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:15.530
Peter Somogyvari: They don't have to, you know, but

61
00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:18.050
Peter Somogyvari: by they can.

62
00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:25.930
Peter Somogyvari: It's I guess it's more of a question for rye. but I'm pretty sure that if they want to join they can.

63
00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:32.650
Ramakrishna V: if I have to assign an issue to them. Their name doesn't appear in the list.

64
00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:40.309
Peter Somogyvari: That's right, then that is because they are not in the organization.

65
00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:41.370
Ramakrishna V: Yeah.

66
00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:45.960
Peter Somogyvari: And they don't have. They also have to have at least

67
00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:55.210
Peter Somogyvari: permission on the repository. but you cannot give them the permission unless they join the organization first.

68
00:07:55.700 --> 00:08:02.710
Peter Somogyvari: So it's a multi-step process. But if you don't want to deal with all of that. The other alternative is

69
00:08:03.410 --> 00:08:11.859
Peter Somogyvari: to ask them to comment on the issue, saying, Hey, I would like to work on this, or literally anything else. It doesn't matter. It's just that

70
00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:18.950
Peter Somogyvari: Github automatically gives you permission to assign the issue to their names

71
00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:23.700
Peter Somogyvari: once they commented on it. And the reason they do it this way is because

72
00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:26.880
Peter Somogyvari: people have been

73
00:08:27.210 --> 00:08:34.160
Peter Somogyvari: abusing other people by assigning issues to them without them asking for it, and then

74
00:08:34.429 --> 00:08:43.399
Peter Somogyvari: they would have something mean or a death threat, or some crazy stuff in the issue description that had nothing to do with the actual like open source software at all.

75
00:08:44.610 --> 00:08:51.150
Peter Somogyvari: So they they made this permission system for a reason. But for us it's kind of annoying because it's religious.

76
00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:53.320
Peter Somogyvari: Some extra h that you have to come.

77
00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:57.739
Ramakrishna V: Not okay. that makes sense.

78
00:08:58.010 --> 00:09:03.970
Ramakrishna V: If he if they did want to join the organization we had to. Right? Right?

79
00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:11.560
Ramakrishna V: Yes, and they also change that. So you don't message right

80
00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:17.430
Peter Somogyvari: directly anymore. You just go to the

81
00:09:18.830 --> 00:09:22.710
Peter Somogyvari: either the to or some other repository. I don't remember

82
00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:24.270
sorry.

83
00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:35.019
Peter Somogyvari: and you open an issue. and they have a template that you can fill out that ask the questions of, Okay, who is this person? What is the Github username?

84
00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:40.829
Peter Somogyvari: What's their email? And then rye sees that issue, and then he

85
00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:52.219
Peter Somogyvari: as them to the org. So the whole old way of just a messaging ride directly is not recommended anymore, because he was quite overwhelmed with

86
00:09:54.520 --> 00:10:05.520
Ramakrishna V: I, if I remember correctly the they also to email community architects. But I don't know if that's the same thing you're supposed to follow, or

87
00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:13.609
Peter Somogyvari: let me double check the link because I have it somewhere. I can look it up

88
00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:16.670
Peter Somogyvari: because I was just doing it

89
00:10:17.630 --> 00:10:21.180
Peter Somogyvari: for someone who just joined my team

90
00:10:21.730 --> 00:10:26.250
Peter Somogyvari: as well. So if you if you give me a minute, I can

91
00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:27.849
Peter Somogyvari: get the link for you.

92
00:10:28.210 --> 00:10:29.000
Ramakrishna V: Yeah.

93
00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:36.260
Peter Somogyvari: Oh, yeah, it's not the Tooc repo, it's

94
00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:41.330
Peter Somogyvari: governance repo. And then this is the link

95
00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:51.499
Peter Somogyvari: you click on the link that just takes you straight to the the new issue creation. And then there's one template specifically that you can choose for

96
00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:56.820
Peter Somogyvari: add someone to the hyper electric. You have work with the first one.

97
00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:59.480
Ramakrishna V: Got it. Okay, thanks a lot.

98
00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:01.830
Peter Somogyvari: No problem

99
00:11:06.430 --> 00:11:15.289
Ramakrishna V: other than that. So Rye moved all of our shoes from the weaver report to that time. So

100
00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:25.950
Ramakrishna V: yeah, officially, we kind of set. I mean the we were we still keeping around, because there is an active dependency there.

101
00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:28.900
Ramakrishna V: so

102
00:11:29.250 --> 00:11:33.940
Ramakrishna V: but you know, as soon as the dependency gets

103
00:11:34.950 --> 00:11:39.120
Ramakrishna V: I mean, as soon as they say they don't need it anymore. Then we can.

104
00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:46.700
Peter Somogyvari: Okay, yeah, that's fine. By me. I don't want to rush you or anything.

105
00:11:46.810 --> 00:11:49.689
Peter Somogyvari: If there's anything I can help with, just let me know.

106
00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:58.709
Ramakrishna V: Sure. Thanks. Yeah. But any anything new we are doing on the backpack. So that repo, we just making some

107
00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:02.330
Ramakrishna V: vulnerability updates with them.

108
00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:07.640
Peter Somogyvari: Yeah, that's good to know. That's I mean, it was always going to be

109
00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:15.690
Peter Somogyvari: the gradual migration. It would have been impossible to to do everything all at once.

110
00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:21.250
Peter Somogyvari: We we're still working with some details, and we will continue working on some of them.

111
00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:26.680
Ramakrishna V: The important thing, in my opinion, is that now we have the code in the same repository, and

112
00:12:26.910 --> 00:12:32.979
Peter Somogyvari: and you're working together. We have communication, and we have the issues in the port request and all that.

113
00:12:33.950 --> 00:12:34.730
Ramakrishna V: Yep.

114
00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:44.770
Ramakrishna V: that somebody is there anything else.

115
00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:47.320
sandeep: you know?

116
00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:51.320
Ramakrishna V: Okay.

117
00:12:53.050 --> 00:13:00.659
Peter Somogyvari: all right. I don't have anything else, either, and I don't know if so, we wanted to join, maybe couldn't make it today.

118
00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:08.520
Ramakrishna V: Yeah, I just didn't have time to read this code. So okay, then.

119
00:13:09.470 --> 00:13:14.350
Peter Somogyvari: that's cool. And we can talk next time and thanks everyone for joining.

120
00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:17.139
sandeep: Okay, thanks.

121
00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:19.080
Ramakrishna V: Bye, bye.
