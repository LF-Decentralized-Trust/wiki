## Discussion items

- (1) Vipin Bharathan presentation: Digital Currency interoperability
  
  - Topic: Interoperability usecase template (ITU) such as CDBC
  - Q. Shingo: There are a lot of kinds of multiple choice of ledgers. How system is suitable?
  - A. There are 2 types. One is a system. The other one is between two systems. DLBC, trade finance, ...
  - Q. Enrique: How to address on Cactus, isn't it?
  - A. This is the kind of scope, network-layer, semantic-layer, ... Each layer
  - Q. Shingo: If you send a template to Cactus mailing list, they can fill out the contents of the template.

The as-of-yet unfinished items from the previous meeting (might have time to finish some of them after the planning but that's unlikely since the planning always takes longer)

- (2) How could we improve pull request review velocity?
  
  - Shingo: One of the suggestion is preparing life-cycle issue list.
  - Enrique: On each contributors meeting, PR reviewing time is needed.
- (3) Consortium Management Plugin
  
  - Shingo: Cactus Node doesn't have multiple channel. This is a single API server and accepting ledgers requests.
  - Peter: Consortium plugin gives the ..
  - Shingo: Management policy managed by the system?
  - Peter: End-user
  - Shingo: Then, Cactus Node server can be accessed all end-users, isn't it?
  - Peter: Yes.
  - Shingo: I consider to accept it, but some usecase using client server and core server is needed. There are some dangers.
  - Shingo: Self-signed http server has no trust. Checking identity is needed. CA is needed.
    
    In our architecture, we prepare Verifier including public key and Validators including private key.
  - Enrique: Is this a traditional way?
  - Shingo: How to reach the server is not traditional.
  - Enrique: Does this require open or closed network?
  - Shingo: Service provider has no information of ledgers in most cases.
  - Hart: How to move CA style? LedgerPlugin needs CA style.
  - Enrique: Manually update everyone.
  - Shingo: We should consider about the trusted third party like PKI. In Validator case, it is satisfied.
  - Enrique: This is good idea.
  - Shingo: This is compromising point.
  - Enrique: How to continue the discussion on the topic and HTLC?
  - Shingo: This is midnight time on Japan, so please go to e-mail discussion.
  - Peter: [https://github.com/hyperledger/cactus/commits/main?after=19afe851dc9efbc37ab012146e9c41bfc296304a+34&amp;branch=main](https://github.com/hyperledger/cactus/commits/main?after=19afe851dc9efbc37ab012146e9c41bfc296304a%2034&branch=main)
- The following agenda was not discussed due to lack of times
- (4) Smart Contracts in Cactus (HTLCs, Federated Validation, Trusted Relays, etc.)
  
  - About the function of getSmartContractList: Design\_of\_getSmartContractList-2021-04-19
- (5) refactor: dangling package.json inside packages directory #682 #719
- (6) Commit message format in [contributing.md](http://contributing.md) (point 6 of the PR Checklist section =&gt; [https://github.com/hyperledger/cactus/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#pr-checklist---contributordeveloper](https://github.com/hyperledger/cactus/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#pr-checklist---contributordeveloper))
