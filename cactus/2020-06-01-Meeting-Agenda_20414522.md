## Announcements

## Discussion

*First proposal on agenda, welcome other topics!*

1. Q2 report task allocation (TSC review June 25th)
2. PR Review
3. Outreach at Hyperledger virtual meeetups [https://www.meetup.com/pro/Hyperledger/](https://www.meetup.com/pro/Hyperledger/)
4. Euro contributors meeting
5. Closing 0.2 and roadmapping 0.3
   
6. (Hart) Discuss any governance rules and how we want to update contributor guidelines.  Fabric, for instance, has this ([https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/CONTRIBUTING.html#](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/CONTRIBUTING.html)) and we should have something similar about project governance.  What we have works now, but we should future-proof and make everything clear to others who want to join.
   
   1. Do we want a formal RFC requirement? (e.g. [https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-rfcs](https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-rfcs))
   2. What are the processes and procedures for major changes?
   3. We should have something in place so that others can see our roadmap, our roadmap procedure, and other work in progress.
   4. There are other points I've probably left out relating to putting together a governance framework–please add things as you find appropriate!
