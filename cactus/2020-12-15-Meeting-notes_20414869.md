## Discussion items

- (1) Proposal to rename default branch to main
  
  - Switch name from "master" to "main"
  - In the current, duplicate branches both of master and main. After the while, master branch is going to be deleted
- (2) Quarterly report (just bumping the thread to make sure it's not forgotten)
- (3) Proposal to update the whitepaper (Especially the chapter of "Architecture")
  
  - The proposal was agreed by Peter.
  - Shingo and Takuma will provide the draft and discuss with Peter.
- (4) Ad-hoc items
- (5) PR loop
  
  - PR331: The PR is discussion point of updating whitepaper
  - PR402: Plugin mechanism is too sensitive on our whitepaper. Peter, Shingo and Takuma will discuss with the necessarity.
  - PR409: The meaning of "consortium" is not clear in the current status in terms of the methods of interface about signatures. The name "Consortium" should be renamed to "Ledger management"?
  - PR368: "Controlling" means such as sending transaction to the ledger. Peter will check Shingo's reply on the GitHub PR.
