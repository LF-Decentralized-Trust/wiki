# Hyperledger Iroha : Suggestions and ideas for HL Iroha 1.x and 2.0!

Created by Sara Garifullina on Jan 24, 2020

### Hello and welcome, dear HL Iroha user, contributor or just our guest!

Here we are collecting ideas for Hypeledger Iroha. Currently, we are working on planning of 2 versions: 

1)  v.1.x - improvements of the current Iroha version. Here local features or fixes can be suggested, like something you could use in your project right now;

2\) v.2.0 - here we start collecting ideas for a very different, renewed Iroha - big global ideas are welcome, something, that could make Iroha the best blockchain there is. 

#### Please, let us know what you think in the comments for this page (do not forget to clarify, which version should have the feature, in your opinion)!

If you have any ideas and would prefer not to share your name publicly, please let me know by e-mail: [garifullina@soramitsu.co.jp](mailto:garifullina@soramitsu.co.jp) or in Rocketchat/ Gitter/ Telegram: liralemur
