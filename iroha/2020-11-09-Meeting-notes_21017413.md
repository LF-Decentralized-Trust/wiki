WhoNotesStepan Lavrentev

- Currently, working on issues with the longevity stand; there were some problems with dependencies.
- Create an issue with the dependency on Burrow build (reason - "Go"-related dependencies on macOS)
- Also, working on the functional testing of the 1.2.0 features
  
  - Finished with Ursa related updates
  - Then will take Burrow-related ones
  - After Burrow will go over the community-reported problem
  - And at the end will finish with regress over common features

- Sent results of benchmarks. RocksDB is still 80x times faster than Postgres
  
  - To make everything fully working on RocksDB, it will be nice to have some help
  - Stepan: Postgres is very memory-consuming on the load. Hence, if RocksDB can manage that, it will make the Iroha network much more stable.
- Moved forward with the issue related to data corruption between WSV and blockstore in case of unexpected shutdown
  
  - Will finish the PR today, then will send it to Stepan
- We can try to build the system on our build macOS machines.
