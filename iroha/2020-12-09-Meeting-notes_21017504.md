- There was no available time for updates today.

  - [iceseer](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/557058:4990bcb6-a037-4038-8a49-fdcc925bfb4f?ref=confluence) : The situation was located yesterday. Most likely, it is the issue in the GRPC thread pool.
  - In logs, there is no final clarity of the reason. We need to add more data in logs.
  - [iceseer](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/557058:4990bcb6-a037-4038-8a49-fdcc925bfb4f?ref=confluence) : We need to get a delay between sending a transaction and taking it into the pool.
  - The related problem is with GRPC connections (probably, "retry" is not working).
- We will talk with the Diva Exchange problems about their questions.
