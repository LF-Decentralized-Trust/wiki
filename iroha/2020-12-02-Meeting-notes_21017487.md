- Today planning to take a look on the issue with peer synchronization.
- Regarding the problem with MST: we have "memory leak" related for storing pending transactions. It can be avoided by rewriting MST to store them in external storage, like PostgreSQL or RocksDB.
  
  - There are abstractions in the MST layer. Storage is limited in a single class. Hence, we will need to write another implementation.
  - Lower bound estimations: 3 fulltime weeks.
- Going to test current Iroha performance and scalability on 32 virtual machines.
