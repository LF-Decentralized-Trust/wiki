## Discussion items

WhoNotes

Ruslan Ganeev

- Updated scripts for performance testing
  
  - Used correct Locust methods and added required commands.
  - Currently cannot check them, as there are some issues on the local environment.
  - Want to do all settings through the UI, for better possibilities of on-site configuration
  - Will have a call with Bulat to define answers on all integration-related questions
  - Had some issues with Locust and block listener. Finally, did it through the single user.
  - We will have web UI with graphics if everything will go well.
  - Will finish today with all preparations.

- There is some small issue on the previous project, will finish it today or tomorrow.
- Today checked logs from Konrad, there are some interesting points
  
  - Log synchronization is not going well. Sometimes two entries are overlapping. In the worst case, there is a race condition.
  - Found the lost thread on consensus (for more than 1 minute) – look like that it was the thread for the lost node. Seems like that there is a block.
  - On the GRPC call, there is a break in the thread for 16 seconds. Seems like that some calls are breaking down, we need to create a network with lost packets between them to get the behaviour and change in flow in such situation.
- Today will perform the experiment with the lost packets. Will build and debug Iroha, with the watchdog thread.
  
  - Logs look like that we have unexpected locks in our threads.
  - [Kamil Salakhiev](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/557058:07723e0b-a027-4cc4-ad6d-324e41cccb4d?ref=confluence) : Do we have some kind of threading control mechanism?
  - GRPC is not limited by thread number, so it creates new ones when needed.
  - We can do parallel logic, but we should keep the synchronized state.
