# Test runs

### Test run I

Test run parameterValueTest targetHyperledger Iroha 1.2.0Test start time2020-12-TBDTest end time2020-12-TBDTest length in minutes~4320 (3 days)Request data

1\) Ordered batch 1 (CreateDomain, CreateAsset, CreateAccount, AddAssetQuantity, TransferAsset)

2\) Ordered batch 2 (GrantPermission, SetAccountDetail)

3\) Ordered batch 3 (SetAccountDetail)

Network configurationConfiguration B (4 nodes, 2 hosts, 5GB memory per node)Iroha configIroha config B (500 max rounds delay, 1000 max proposal size)

#### Results

Trial runs were made and the results obtained the following data:

#### Conclusions

The current performance of the Iroha network is much lower than in previous releases. Hence, the team is concentrated now on finding the reason and making a patch that will make the performance at least not lower than before.
