## Announcements

Release 1.2.0 is almost ready to be published – we are finishing last regression testing steps.

We are going to perform performance testing soon.

## Discussion

### Iroha 1.2.0 release preparations

The Hyperledger Iroha is now on the latest steps of acceptance before the 1.2.0 release. With high probability, the next week, the release will be ready.

There are a few known issues, which are minor and could not influence the quality of systems running in production.

### The prototype of using RocksDB for storage

[Andrei Lebedev](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/557058:c02f1b3d-42e6-4519-ba84-2d0476dccbc9?ref=confluence) is now working on the prototype for replacing Postgres by the RocksDB in-memory storage. The current result partially covers the minimum set of commands and queries and shows tremendous ~80-160 times speed boost.
