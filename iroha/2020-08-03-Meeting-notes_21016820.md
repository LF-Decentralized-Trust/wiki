[Andrei Lebedev](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/557058:c02f1b3d-42e6-4519-ba84-2d0476dccbc9?ref=confluence)

- The security audit was finished, David has some comments on that.
  
  - Had a meeting with Tevora on Friday. David insisted that we need to add the fix in 1.2 release.
  - Currently, we may create a platform-dependent quick fix.
- There were several fixes to the RC:
  
  - If the DB is not available during work, Iroha is going down. PR is opened, but we need to discuss the solution.
  - SetSettingValue - the command is stateful, and we need to add stateful validation of that command. Mikhail added check for the description length
  - [Михаил Болдырев](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/557058:584193b8-9303-4b5a-8cb3-8153294c8cc2?ref=confluence) There is an anomaly in the node behaviour during sync. Looks like the ledger state async.
  - Stephan: On longevity, we have CPU increase and nodes going to reboot. I have added MST transactions to the Locust script before it. Last execution was 24 hours ago and the CPU is growing.
  - [Andrei Lebedev](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/557058:c02f1b3d-42e6-4519-ba84-2d0476dccbc9?ref=confluence) : It is a known issue with MST messages because there is no memory limit and overflow of transactions can influence work.
- Stepan is making a document with the list of all current issues and their status, hence we can make a release once all issues will be handled.
- Finished prototype with the modular data model. There is a prototype with a transactional engine written on Python.  The solution was liked by Ales. We need to provide a 1-page document comparison with Iroha 2 current instructions implementation. Unfortunately, now we have no clear technical description of the ISI, so we need to get data.

- HSM was decided to be postponed by Ales.
  
  - FInished implementation on the following status: Utimaco on the review, PKCS is failing with segfault, needs debug.
- We need to concentrate on the Iroha 2 switch.
- Will proceed with fixing CPU load on longevity and GRPC issue found by audit.

[Sara Garifullina](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/5b6c115b2c9bd83c03707f95?ref=confluence)

- Fixed documentation after feedback
- Defended TSC quarter report
- Release notes are planned to be done soon, will proceed with commits analysis.
  
  - [Andrei Lebedev](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/557058:c02f1b3d-42e6-4519-ba84-2d0476dccbc9?ref=confluence) &gt; We made RC2 and wanted to update the release notes for it. RC2 was requested by Bulat to apply it for the internal project.

Stephan Lavrentev

- Currently checking all fixes in RC2
- Working on longevity stand testing improvement
- Discussed the CompareAndSet solution with developers of SoraNet, received the approval of the solution. Old libraries are compatible with the decision.
- There are some not merged PRs for fixes, waiting for them to check and approve

## Action items
