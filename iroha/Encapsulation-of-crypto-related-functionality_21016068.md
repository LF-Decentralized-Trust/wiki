# Hyperledger Iroha : Encapsulation of crypto related functionality

Created by Nikita Puzankov on Apr 24, 2020

Right now we have two main \`crypto\` APIs: \`iroha::crypto\` and \`ursa\`.

Main entities of both APIs:

- Private and Public Keys
- Signatures

We already have an abstraction over some \`ursa\` entities. Proposal is to encapsulate everything under \`iroha::crypto\` do not exposing \`ursa\` related entities outside this module.

It means that new methods for generating keypairs and signature verification would be added to \`iroha::crypto\` with wrapper entities (Public/PrivateKey).
