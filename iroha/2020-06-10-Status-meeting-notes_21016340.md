- Continuing rebasing of HSM integration branch
- Want to test the issue from the community chat
  
  - [Andrei Lebedev](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/557058:c02f1b3d-42e6-4519-ba84-2d0476dccbc9?ref=confluence) &gt; We need to test all endpoints, there is a risk that they would not work

Stepan Lavrentev

- I have faced the issue with the Ursa integration testing using current Python lib. I am using the SHA-2 (512) crypto and NACL library
  
  - [Михаил Болдырев](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/557058:584193b8-9303-4b5a-8cb3-8153294c8cc2?ref=confluence) &gt; I have performed the investigation. Probably there is an incompatibility between crypto libraries
  - I have also tried the Python implementation of DCA
  - [Andrei Lebedev](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/557058:c02f1b3d-42e6-4519-ba84-2d0476dccbc9?ref=confluence) &gt; There is an open PR in Iroha-python lib from Kamill. It uses the correct library.
- Regarding Burrow integration testing: there is information about the smart contract for testing in the documentation.
  
  - [Andrei Lebedev](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/557058:c02f1b3d-42e6-4519-ba84-2d0476dccbc9?ref=confluence) &gt; Open engineCallTest file and get the list of test-smart-contracts. They are used for integration testing.
  - Seems like that there is an issue with the documentation about Burrow. Address of singleService contract
- Started checking P2P TLS encryption. There is a question – how can I add a new node to the network with enabled P2P TLS?
  
  - [Andrei Lebedev](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/557058:c02f1b3d-42e6-4519-ba84-2d0476dccbc9?ref=confluence) &gt; There is no such feature in the current release.
  - [Михаил Болдырев](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/557058:584193b8-9303-4b5a-8cb3-8153294c8cc2?ref=confluence) &gt; We should fix the documentation, there is no TLS for P2P currently, TLS is working only for Torii
- Regarding Ursa integration: probably we need to add details, that currently, we are working on with the Ed25519 and SHA-2 only
  
  - [Sara Garifullina](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/5b6c115b2c9bd83c03707f95?ref=confluence) &gt; I will add that note to the documentation
- Regarding TLS configuration for Torii: how to enable it?
  
  - [Andrei Lebedev](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/557058:c02f1b3d-42e6-4519-ba84-2d0476dccbc9?ref=confluence) &gt; This should be configured by the user, the certificate should be provided by the user, too

## Action items

- Stepan will continue with intensive testing of new features and with regression testing, [Михаил Болдырев](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/557058:584193b8-9303-4b5a-8cb3-8153294c8cc2?ref=confluence) and [Andrei Lebedev](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/557058:c02f1b3d-42e6-4519-ba84-2d0476dccbc9?ref=confluence) will support it.
