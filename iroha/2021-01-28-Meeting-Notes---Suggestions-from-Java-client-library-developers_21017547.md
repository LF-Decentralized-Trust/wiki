# Hyperledger Iroha : 2021-01-28 Meeting Notes - Suggestions from Java client library developers

Created by Egor Ivkov, last modified on Jan 28, 2021

**Suggested by:** Alexey Chernyshov

1. **Suggestion** A lot of duplication of information in data model for API. (Example: Register instruction will have same AssetDefinitionId and AccountId in two places). Suggested to either use a slightly different data model for API than for internal representation or to deduplicate internal data model.
2. **Suggestion** Pair Instruction is not useful as there is a Sequence instruction.
3. **Suggestion** There are some queries without potential use cases.
4. Query all domains returns the whole WSV. Could result in enormous message sizes.
5. **Suggestion** Pagination is needed.
6. **Suggestion** If transaction timeouts in a queue it seems this event is not logged. Better to have this in logs.
7. **Suggestion** Add Error Response on timeouts in WebSocket.
8. **Suggestion** Support Ping-Pong messages in WebSocket.
