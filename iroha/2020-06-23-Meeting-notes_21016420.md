WhoNotes

[Nikita Puzankov](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/5df113768998970e5b434e0a?ref=confluence)

- Performed several sessions of the project scope estimation and planning
- Worked on the sergeJSON integration
- Finished the RFC of the maintenance endpoint
- Had a meeting about the event triggers with the internal team of stakeholders
- Will proceed with RFC for multi-signature transactions
  
  - Then will take the most important task from the board

[Andrei Lebedev](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/557058:c02f1b3d-42e6-4519-ba84-2d0476dccbc9?ref=confluence)

- Had a call about the Iroha 1 → Iroha 2 modular structure based switch
  
  - [Evgeny Kovalev](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/712020:594f9075-4294-4635-bee5-2184c91eb7b6?ref=confluence)  will prepare a document
- Will review the MST RFC and add important parts which will help us to avoid obstacles and provide more maintainable solutions
  
  - [武宮誠](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/557058:12c320e6-5d17-404f-b20e-bfa5721ae960?ref=confluence) we should copy the design of MST from Iroha 1 as a basis, and then design the approach for conditional logic and related DSL
  - Yes, talking in current terms, the idea will be in ISI instructions triggered by the event listeners
  - [武宮誠](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/557058:12c320e6-5d17-404f-b20e-bfa5721ae960?ref=confluence) we can follow the approach from existing solutions, but probably we will stick to the simplest approach and then improve along the way. We need to come to an agreement about the most important use cases for the production projects and satisfy related requirements first.
- First draft of proposal will be ready until Thursday

[Михаил Болдырев](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/557058:584193b8-9303-4b5a-8cb3-8153294c8cc2?ref=confluence)

- Finishing the integration of HSM into the core
- Have faced the issue with the issue of Utimaco SDK
- Also working together with Stepan on the 1.2.0 preparation
  
  - There are several proposals of the documentation improvement

[Egor Ivkov](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/5dd9631c1cf3c20ef5ff9f0f?ref=confluence)

- Currently, working on the Sumeragi improvements
  
  - Merged 4 PRs with minor improvements
- Also, working on the Docker compose improvement
- Finalizing integration of the Ursa library into the project
- Had a discussion about block validation, we need to have a look of [武宮誠](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/557058:12c320e6-5d17-404f-b20e-bfa5721ae960?ref=confluence) on the questions in the chat
  
  - [武宮誠](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/557058:12c320e6-5d17-404f-b20e-bfa5721ae960?ref=confluence) in case of the block with invalid transactions, we can do both: reject or filter. But for robustness, filtering is better, because even with the "bad" leader we can reach the consensus.
  - [Andrei Lebedev](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/557058:c02f1b3d-42e6-4519-ba84-2d0476dccbc9?ref=confluence) rejection of the blocks with invalid transactions can lead to the situation with many rejected blocks in the list and corresponding overflooding.
- Started working on the block sync between nodes. Probably will post the PR after finishing Docker compose fixes.
- Will proceed with the validation fixes according to discussion

[Sara Garifullina](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/5b6c115b2c9bd83c03707f95?ref=confluence)

- I built few versions of docs in RTD and shown them to Nikita. There are several possible approaches. We need to review and choose. All options work in MD and RST.
- There is a special add-on to the RTD to work with tables
- We can also add Shieldy bot to the community chats in the aim to prevent a flood, spam messages and scam members.

[Kamil Salakhiev](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/557058:07723e0b-a027-4cc4-ad6d-324e41cccb4d?ref=confluence)

- There was some discussion with Egor about the sync process
- Also, we discussed triggers with Nikita and Iurii
- Regarding conditional MST, we can integrate the existing solution of this problem, which works with the WSV analysis.
  
  - [武宮誠](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/557058:12c320e6-5d17-404f-b20e-bfa5721ae960?ref=confluence) yes, it sounds logical enough, we can consider it
