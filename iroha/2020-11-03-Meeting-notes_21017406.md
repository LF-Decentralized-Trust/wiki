- Fixed problem with too big build size (32 Gb → 21 Gb) which helped with the build on the LinuxONE machine.
  
  - There are two other big components which provide big chunks of additional debug symbols: "RX" components and
  - There is a way how to get rid out of "Rx" components, but it is not trivial as it requires changes in architecture. It would not change the whole Iroha, but it will take significant time.
- There is an idea of the commit procedure improvement: save to the disk block store first and then to DB.
  
  - We will do the fix in that way, it should solve the existing problem.
  - Will take it today. Will also consider the check of success of adding to DB, which may make the speed of commit slower.
