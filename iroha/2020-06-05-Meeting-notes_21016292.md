- Will take over the merge of Burrow.
- If we need to have a package with Shephard, we need to discuss it. It is useful for the utility service usage.
- Migration scripts take more time than expected. They need to be tested because that can cause issues with the state.
- In 1.1.3 we did not make the change in the DB version.
- Need to make a checklist for the release activities.
- We have added sorting by timestamp in the ordering PR by Alexander. But there is no transaction time in 1.1.3, hence we need to think about migration rules. One option – to use block storage. We will stick to that decision (it will make migration much longer, but will lead to consistency). Also, we will put the note in instruction regarding the version of the base (for 1.1.2 and 1.1.3).
- As the next step, we need to create release 1.1.4 with synchronizer fix and fix for version in CMake.

- Worked on the tests with enabled sanitizers. Most of the issues caused by false-alarms.
- Fixed some problems with potential memory leaks
