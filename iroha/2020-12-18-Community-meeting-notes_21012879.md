- The main issue now – reducing the network performance in specific conditions, when the connection for several peers is poor.
  
  - Now we are collecting information and trying to find the sequence which creates such a situation in the network.
  - Currently, the primary reason is not clear, but we are working on the localization of the situation

- Sara is working on the instruction about "AddPeer" operation – she will experience whole hands-on experience and write a detailed step by step instruction.
- We are preparing all the required things for performance testing. We will run it next week. You can get all details on the [Release 1.2.0](Release-1.2.0_21012857.html) article.

- We fixed some bugs which were found on the longevity and
- We have added a basic permissions framework
- The startup process was also improved and simplified. Now there are fewer struggles in running the network.
- There are some improvements in API, we have implemented events and streaming via WebSockets. Event types are split into two groups: pipeline events (transaction and blocks) and data events (data model changes).
- Our plans: add "grant permission" feature.

- I have a question about version migration from 1.1.3 to 1.2.0 – I have noticed that the version of schema in DB is "1.1.1". Is it okay?
  
  - [Vadim Reutskiy](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/5b8d04b72786fb2bf79a7405?ref=confluence) : Yes, you can do that, but very important "step 0" for such operation – backup everything before running the script. And also it is better to try everything on the "staging" environment.
- Is it going to work if I change "1.2.0 RC" to "1.2.0"?
  
  - Konrad: change from 1.2.0 RC to 1.2.0 is seamless
