- Regarding the graceful shutdown in case of issues with the connection to DB, we can do it quite fast.
  
  - We will proceed with that "workaround" using whitelist for acceptable exceptions, which should be ignored. All other exceptions should lead to restart/reconnect of Iroha.
  - [Михаил Болдырев](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/557058:584193b8-9303-4b5a-8cb3-8153294c8cc2?ref=confluence) There is a risk that text-based workaround will cause many troubles in case of changes in messages.
  - [Vadim Reutskiy](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/5b8d04b72786fb2bf79a7405?ref=confluence) We should consider the flag or configuration parameter for enabling and disabling that workaround
  - [Михаил Болдырев](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/557058:584193b8-9303-4b5a-8cb3-8153294c8cc2?ref=confluence) We can also think about dividing the problem into two: network-based and DB connection based.
  - [Vadim Reutskiy](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/5b8d04b72786fb2bf79a7405?ref=confluence) Let's do it in "blacklist" of exceptions, which must lead to the reconnect.
  - [Михаил Болдырев](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/557058:584193b8-9303-4b5a-8cb3-8153294c8cc2?ref=confluence) I have already added a method which takes the exception when we can add that logic for analysis of the exception text.
  - I will take care of that issue. But currently, I am working on personal tasks. Optimistically will take the task after September 28.
- Checked the environment variables, it can be done in 8 hours approximately.

- I will probably take care of the DB task if will have time on vacation.
