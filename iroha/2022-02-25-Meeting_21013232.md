Created by Sara Garifullina, last modified on Apr 27, 2022

## Iroha 1 Updates:

A lot of work was made on MST:

- Rewrote MST module, made it simpler. Now signatures are counted in Ordering Service, and the transactions with enough signatures get into cache way quicker.
- Added MST metrics
- Reworked MST tests

## Iroha 2 Presenting Updates and Release
