# Hyperledger Iroha : Use cases

Created by Yuriy Vinogradov, last modified by Nikita Puzankov on Aug 11, 2020

# Cases

## Order Book case

Users send bid and ask limit orders into the order book. Every order in the order book should be executed when counter order with the same price will be received. Speaking other word it should happen when bid meets ask at the same price. In this case limit order should be notified that there is a matching order and swap should be executed with resulting funds sent to the owners of both orders. Looks like this notification is reasonable to implement using triggers.

### Challenges

1. Challenging here is that there might be really a lot of orders in the order book and every order should have a trigger and every trigger should be checked somehow if price counter order exists or not.
2. Another challenge is that after one order executed using a certain amount of funds of counter order, other orders having the same price cannot be executed on the same amount of the counter order funds. Other orders even for the same price should wait for new free fund amounts of counter orders.
