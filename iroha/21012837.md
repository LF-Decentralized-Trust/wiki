## Background

## Problem

There is no updated analysis about the surface of blockchain solutions and possible competitors of Iroha, which makes the positioning much harder.

Correct positioning will make easier many decisions in the project:

- scope definition
- feature prioritization
- quality attributes definition
- reuse of existing libraries and solutions
- technical decisions

Hence, we need to perform analysis (possible in form of SWOT analysis) and create the document which will describe Iroha 2 target niche in the current set of blockchain systems.
