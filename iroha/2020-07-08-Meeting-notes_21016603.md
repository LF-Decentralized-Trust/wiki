- Interns are not doing very well, there are some issues in their motivation and skills.
- SecuroSys HSM: working on the integration. Using the PKCS11 library, which was taken as a binary standard. Currently working on the abstraction layer, which will support the PKCS standard.
  
  - Utimaco also has the support of the PKCS, so we can reuse it, too. However, we will need to support the Utimaco set up to support the PKCS.
  - HSM usage is configurable from the config file, "Crypto" section.
- Environment variables: on hold.

- We had a meeting with IBM representative about the LinuxONE compatibility. We need to port VCPKG in the aim to make Iroha compilable on that architecture. They will provide virtual machine and support on technical questions.
