- Currently, we have logger configuration working as expected. Patterns are selected correspondingly to the selected level of logging. Hence, there is no possibility to use several patterns for single logger.
  
  - I will tell [Sara Garifullina](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/5b6c115b2c9bd83c03707f95?ref=confluence) Â about the required update of the documentation, so she can add that.
- Will work on merge "Support 1.2.x" branch into the master branch.
- We need also merge the Python client library update from Stepan. I will take care of that.
