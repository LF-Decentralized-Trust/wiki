- Started writing test for making the same actions as was done on the Longevity stand. The test is ready.
  
  - Both Postgres and memory problems can be checked by that test.
  - Next step: find a reason for the problem and solve it.
  - Postgres issue does not have an obvious reason for now. There are no consistent results. Mikhail proposed to save all logs and timings
  - Memory consumption: we have a code which counts objects and pointers. [Михаил Болдырев](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/557058:584193b8-9303-4b5a-8cb3-8153294c8cc2?ref=confluence) merged that code.
  - Protobuf-generated classes make a problem with the pointer counting, as they cannot be easily wrapped.
- I need to also update the test for optimization of the memory in the test
- In Postgres, we currently have all data saved, so we can proceed with the analysis.
  
  - I can share the test on Github, so Stephan can start making experiments, gather data and make an analysis.

- Now working on the code with pointers and objects counting for catching the problem with the synchronization memory over-consumption.
- We need a task for making the pointer counting for reuse
  
  - For making the code ready to merge in "master"

Stepan Lavrentev

- I will get the test and parameters from Andrey and check the data.
- Also, working on the preparation of Locust image for longevity stand with Sofiane

[Sara Garifullina](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/5b6c115b2c9bd83c03707f95?ref=confluence)
