## Discussion items

WhoNotesStepan Lavrentev

- Finished with the regression testing, created a test report:
  
  - There are no new features support in Java, iOS and JavaScript libraries
- During the public key check, we have the possibility to drop down the Iroha node.
  
  - If we are sending too long string, Iroha is going down. Seems like that it is on the public key length validation. It works on the string with length around 1000 public keys.
  - I have created an issue for that
- On the longevity env, I have got the issue with the synchronization on the forced hard restart. One of the peers get down after the restart and cannot go back because WSV if 1 block in front of block store.
- Still need to make the regression test list more exhaustive and covering more details

- We need to restore fuzzing testing, as there was an issue with CI which caused lost of integration. There is a PR which needs to be merged.
- Added note about the logger configuration, need to get a review from the team
