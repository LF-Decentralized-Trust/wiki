## Discussion items

WhoNotes

[Vadim Reutskiy](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/5b8d04b72786fb2bf79a7405?ref=confluence)

- We still need to have single approver for the "Iroha2\*" branches
  
  - [武宮誠](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/557058:12c320e6-5d17-404f-b20e-bfa5721ae960?ref=confluence) &gt; We need to be very careful because Iroha is a very significant product.
  - [Nikita Puzankov](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/5df113768998970e5b434e0a?ref=confluence) &gt; We are just want to stick to the previous process.
  - We can consider increasing to two reviewers later, when the team will be bigger and closer to the first production release.
  - No objections here from the other team members.
  - [Andrei Lebedev](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/557058:c02f1b3d-42e6-4519-ba84-2d0476dccbc9?ref=confluence) &gt; If we will have ~6 people in the team, it will be a good moment to switch to w reviewers

 [Nikita Puzankov](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/5df113768998970e5b434e0a?ref=confluence)

- Since the last meeting made an RFC for MST transactions, we discussed it with Iurii and Vladislav
- Checked requests for PRs
- There is a request regarding the query security vulnerabilities from Iurii, I will continue with it
- Now I am working on the maintenance subscription mechanism, will proceed with PR later today
- There are some questions from Vladislav about the ISI
- There is also some new dependency proposed, we need to discuss it in RFC

[Andrei Lebedev](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/557058:c02f1b3d-42e6-4519-ba84-2d0476dccbc9?ref=confluence)

- There are no updates on the document from Eugene, hence we will proceed with Mikhail
- We are in contact with the data model project intern, there was a plan proposed, so we will include it also in the proposal
- I will look for the RFC with MST description.
- There is not so much RFC about the Maintenance endpoint
  
  - [Nikita Puzankov](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/5df113768998970e5b434e0a?ref=confluence) &gt; We are working without RFC, as things are changing now

[Михаил Болдырев](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/557058:584193b8-9303-4b5a-8cb3-8153294c8cc2?ref=confluence)

- Currently finishing the HSM integration in 1.2.0
- Also, working on the solution of the linking problem

[Kamil Salakhiev](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/557058:07723e0b-a027-4cc4-ad6d-324e41cccb4d?ref=confluence)

- I have reviewed the security vulnerability RFC, and look like that we need to have a brainstorm the solution as it looks like serious now
- Probably, we have to improve somehow to improve our permission problem
  
  - [武宮誠](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/557058:12c320e6-5d17-404f-b20e-bfa5721ae960?ref=confluence) &gt; There is not a big problem as Iroha still permissioned network. In Private solutions the environment should be protected, in Public – it is not a big deal.

[Sara Garifullina](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/5b6c115b2c9bd83c03707f95?ref=confluence)

- I want to discuss the one issue with MD usage in RTD. There is no option for TOC structures.
  
  - Can we have a single index page using RST format to put the TOC?
  - I am also trying to find the solution
  - [Nikita Puzankov](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/5df113768998970e5b434e0a?ref=confluence) &gt; Yes, sure, having such workaround is okay.

[武宮誠](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/557058:12c320e6-5d17-404f-b20e-bfa5721ae960?ref=confluence)

- I have an idea of composability for the Iroha 2 based applications. This idea should be a basis for further improvements.
- There are some issues in other projects, caused by bad implementation of ERC20 tokens. We can avoid such problems with Iroha 2.
- Another key thing – is to have the possibility to create events and put corresponding logic.
- We should consider it while designing the event model

[Egor Ivkov](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/5dd9631c1cf3c20ef5ff9f0f?ref=confluence)

- Finalized the Docker compose tests for the pipeline, along with correcting the configuration
- There are some required scenarios for synchronization improvement
  
  - Will start with AddPeer instruction
- Block sync is not a part of Sumeragi
- Regarding Sumeragi there are some minor TODOs left, hence I will finish the block sync first.

## Decisions

Number of reviewers for PRs

According to the discussion, the team made to decision to keep **single** reviewer for approving PRs in "iroha2\*" branches.
