- The library for the configuration management is limited by the structure of the configuration.
  
  - We need to get the information about how this configuration will be used
  - The issues are related to the user-defined keys
  - Also, we have case-sensitive parameters, but in command line it is not possible
- Still no response from SecuroSys support
- Regarding the CI for Utimaco, we can configure it in the way not to expose the simulator and use it for testing only in internal environments
- There are no new updates from Stepan regarding the check of the 1.2.0 release

- Will take a look on the Utimaco PR on the current week
- For Iroha 2 it will be nice to generate structure of classes from the source code. We need to get information about the pipeline as minimum so we can evaluate the sequence and provide the feedback about most obvious places to improve.
