- Debugging PKCS11 functionality, as it has some SegFault errors now
- Sent the PR with CompareAndSet fix
- Intern found the library with PKCS11 interface which was certified by the Russian government
- There are some not clear parts in the Burrow documentation regarding accounts. Probably we need to think about the improvement of this part – change Burrow accounts to Iroha account.
