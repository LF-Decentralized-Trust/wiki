- Found the reason for the issue on the streaming query.
  
  - Currently writing test and fix for that situation
  - The issue was introduced during the refactoring of the data model
- During the status on Iroha 2 have confirmed the most important RFC to be reviewed.
- There was an idea to create a framework for client-library testing. We already have some kind of binary framework in Iroha already.
  
  - We need to find a document about the organization of such testing
- Will check the report from the Tevora
  
  - [Sara Garifullina](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/5b6c115b2c9bd83c03707f95?ref=confluence) I will take care of the report receiving

[Sara Garifullina](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/5b6c115b2c9bd83c03707f95?ref=confluence)

- Will take care of the security audit report
- Will take care of the documentation issues once I will finish all critical tasks

- Agreed with DevOps guys about the environment variables
  
  - There are some sections in configuration, which are not trivial to implement.
  - We will not do the standard support for "log" and "crypto" sections now. They will be available using the JSON value of the single parameter.
  - Command-line currently is connected to the config in a very weak way. Hence, there will be no support of 3-way configuration now
  - The current solution for the keys will be deprecated
- Working on SecuroSys implementation of PKCS11 standard
- There are three more PRs with "1.2" tag which should be merged, need to have a review for them.

Stepan Lavrentev

- Burrow integration testing
  
  - Contracts, which are interacting with Iroha state through the basic contract, have some issues
  - There are also not so transparent behaviour with logs
  - Waiting for the response from [Evgeny Kovalev](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/712020:594f9075-4294-4635-bee5-2184c91eb7b6?ref=confluence)
- TLC on client-side
  
  - We need to have responsible people for the client libraries, as they are not updated.
  - There are some not obvious parts of the TLC certificates configuration in the Python lib, it will be great to add it to the documentation.
- Regarding the "use-lib-ursa" task, which does not allow Iroha to be built.
  
  - [Andrei Lebedev](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/557058:c02f1b3d-42e6-4519-ba84-2d0476dccbc9?ref=confluence) &gt; We need to get error codes
- In Genesis, we have "SetSetting" parameter. Is there any functionality except the size of the transaction description?
  
  - [Михаил Болдырев](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/557058:584193b8-9303-4b5a-8cb3-8153294c8cc2?ref=confluence) &gt; Yes, it is only the transaction description length
- Tested
  
  - Ursa integration
  - Node sync
  - MST phantom transactions - consensus update. We will also add MST transactions on the longevity stand.
  - Root permissions (one bug found and fixed, need to retest)
  - Migration to 1.2.0 version
- Need to test
  
  - Root permissions fix
  - Report from DevOps about "-reuse-wsv" flag, when Iroha connects to the wrong DB.
  - Retest issue with the case dependency (from Bakong dev env)

## Action items
