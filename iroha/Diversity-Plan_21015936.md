# Hyperledger Iroha : Diversity Plan

Created by Sara Garifullina on Feb 26, 2019

To ensure the diversity of the Hyperledger Iroha community the current team of maintainers suggests the following plan. Following the plan is expected to lead to a bigger and more stable community for future development of the framework.

**Our Vision**

We see open-source community as a perfect place where anyone could feel confident that their ideas and contributions will be appreciated.

**Why diversity is important**

- Open-source product cannot maintain itself in a homogeneous environment;
- Best ideas and best people to do the job cannot be centralised

**Goals to diversify the community**

*Goal 1. To create a comfortable place for contributors of different backgrounds, cultures, genders and from different fields of knowledge*

- To welcome and encourage different types of contributions, not only code contributions but also translations, help with documentation and other materials, use-cases and others, so any member of the community could be appreciated for his/her unique contribution;
- To encourage more translations of documentation to make it more accessible;
- Make an incentive model clear to the contributors, explaining them under which circumstances Hyperledger can provide them with freebies

*Goal 2. To diversify the vendors working on Hyperledger Iroha*

- To fork Iroha for Soramitsu projects to make it more independent from the current team’s vision;
- To present Hyperledger Iroha to the leading  vendors that might be interested in developing Iroha within the community; right now we have some discussions going with our use case partners in Japan;
- Provide support in understanding Iroha and developing with it

*Goal 3. To proactively reach out to diverse communities of developers interested in blockchain development.*

- Work with other HL communities on different projects, such as Smart Contract WG;
- Work with universities - create workshops, use-cases for learning more about blockchain; we currently have a fruitful experience with the University of Aizu in Japan and Innopolis University, Russia, where students work on Iroha-powered projects and contribute to the docs and codebase of the project
- Contacting developers’ communities online to inform them about opportunity of contributing to Iroha and using it for their projects;
- Participate in meetups, promoting Iroha as a playground for ideas for contributors, and as a robust tool
- Start weekly calls with the community for project planning.
