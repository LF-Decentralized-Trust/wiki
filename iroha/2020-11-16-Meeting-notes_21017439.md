## Discussion items

WhoNotesStepan Lavrentev

- Changed memory setting on the Longevity stand. They start going down and the issue was not repeated.
  
  - However, today I found that a single machine is not starting. Seems like that single file in block store is not correctly written (the last block), and Iroha cannot proceed with such state.
  - Did not tried to fix the problem. Will write Andrey about it so he will check the situation and behaviour. The current issue was found with enabled "reuse WSV"  flag.
  - Seems like that we will need to increase "quality" of transaction nature with the block storage.
- Continued TLS testing. Will make a commit to the Python lib with changes. TLS seems working.
- Features of 1.2.0 release most seem to be tested.
- There are some other "weak" parts left, will take it after the 1.2.0
- After that only the standard flow of testing, all commands and queries will be left for the regression.

- Working on the documentation for the "env vars" function. All docs are ready, need to fix the PR according to the review.
  
  - Will try to finish it today
