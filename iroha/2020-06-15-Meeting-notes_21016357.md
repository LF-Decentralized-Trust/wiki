- Stepan found some issues with the Ursa integration
  
  - Iroha with SHA-2 key pair is not starting up
  - Iroha + Ursa cannot be built on macOS (this support was not proposed)
  - Python library was fixed and PR was updated
- Working on the Utimaco rebase into the master branch, there are some technical debt
  
  - There is a single stateless validator with the signature, which is not elegant. Was implemented before. Need to mark it as technical debt.
  - Will continue the Utimaco integration
  - Probably will finish all integration until Wednesday
- HL interns have a deadline for making plans today. Currently, we are discussing the plan and making the definition of their goals

- HL Interns update
  
  - Consensus project: there is a proposal for removing the current ordering service and use the same approach as we are using in MST. It can speed up the consensus.
  - Modular data model: we are planning to make both validations in independent modules in the aim to use it externally and provide the possibility to plug other modules. It will also allow to abstract WSV from other parts of the system
  - WSV improvement: to exchange PostgreSQL to some in-memory storage by making it pluggable
- We need to continue to think towards the work together with Iroha 2 team on reusable components
- We can also improve the situation with the keeping of rejected transactions in the block storage. [武宮誠](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/557058:12c320e6-5d17-404f-b20e-bfa5721ae960?ref=confluence)'s idea that sent transaction can be accepted at any time after it is created is really good.
