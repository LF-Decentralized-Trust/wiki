- Fixed the test in Mikhail's PR, now waiting for the CI to finish.
  
  - Will merge it today to the main branch.
  - We need to add documentation about environment variables. Mikhail needs to explain it to Sara.
- Mikhail prepares PR which includes utility service and application packaging. We must merge it before the release, as I see.
  
  - This changes will add the "Shepherd" tool binary to the standard packaging of the Iroha.
  - Currently, it requires testing. Seems like that now it is breaks backwards compatibility. I need to check the Docker images now.
- We need to have a discussion about the role in the project
