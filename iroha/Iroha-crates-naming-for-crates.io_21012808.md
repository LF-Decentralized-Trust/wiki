## Background

crates.io is a central repository for Rust crates (binary applications and libraries).

\`iroha\` crate name on crates.io with \`iroha-derive\` and \`iroha-internal\` were occupied so we need to find another name for our main crate. 

## Problem

crates.io has no ability to delete already created crates, so the only way is to use new names to be published there.

## Solution

As a solution we propose to publish a following set of crates:

- iroha - binary application to start Iroha Peer, this crate's artifacts will be used for docker images
- iroha\_core - library containing Iroha "backend" or peer-side logic
- iroha\_client - library containing Iroha Rust clients API
- iroha\_client\_cli - binary application which provides command line interface on top of iroha\_client
- iroha\_crypto - library containing Iroha crypto related logic (Key Pairs generators, Hashing algorithms, etc.)
- iroha\_crypto\_cli - binary application which provides command line interface on top of iroha\_crypto
- iroha\_data\_model - library containing domain entities like  Domain and Account, Iroha Special Instructions and Iroha Queries
- iroha\_dsl - library containing Domain Language specific entities like macroses, popular compositions of instructions and examples
- iroha\_http\_server - library containing HTTP related functionality
- iroha\_logger - library containing logging related functionality
- iroha\_macro - library containing Iroha macroses

### Decisions

- use new names for iroha crates
- get on top of crates.io search index by providing a lot of downloads for our crates

### Alternatives

- Get in touch with [https://crates.io/users/dark-flames](https://crates.io/users/dark-flames) and ask to provide credentials for current crates with an ability to put new versions with our Iroha on top of already existing
- Use private cargo registry

### Concerns

At start people may use \`iroha\` crate instead of \`irohad\`.

### Assumptions

We will provide information about this situation on our web pages.

### Risks

- 3rd party malicious agent can take \`iroha\` to fight our reputation.
