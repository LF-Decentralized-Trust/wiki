[Nikita Puzankov](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/5df113768998970e5b434e0a?ref=confluence)

- [Ales Zivkovic](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/5b3a36d1d38a522e77ff78c0?ref=confluence)  How we are going to handle the external values?
  
  - [Yuriy Vinogradov](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/557058:0b85dbf9-2cc9-4bee-a3a0-2815e5bb51eb?ref=confluence) We can separate triggers and off-chain functionality to put the data into the blockstore and use it in triggers.
  - Even if we will remove triggers from the system, the problem will consist
  - [Ales Zivkovic](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/5b3a36d1d38a522e77ff78c0?ref=confluence) I am asking because of the previously existing components. Anton Khvorov can provide the details
  - [Yuriy Vinogradov](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/557058:0b85dbf9-2cc9-4bee-a3a0-2815e5bb51eb?ref=confluence) We can use bridges as off-chain information receivers. By making their generic, we can use them for different uses.
- [武宮誠](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/557058:12c320e6-5d17-404f-b20e-bfa5721ae960?ref=confluence) Are triggers consumed when used?
  
  - Triggers are stored in the "peer" entity. There are special instructions for registration of triggers
  - [武宮誠](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/557058:12c320e6-5d17-404f-b20e-bfa5721ae960?ref=confluence) For many use cases, there should be triggers with one-time usage. There is a potential exploit when the trigger can be used indefinitely and use too many resources. We should provide the possibility to use permissions
  - We can add additional trigger which will unregister existing triggers
  - [武宮誠](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/557058:12c320e6-5d17-404f-b20e-bfa5721ae960?ref=confluence) It is fine to have one additional trigger, but how you will force people to create triggers?

[武宮誠](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/557058:12c320e6-5d17-404f-b20e-bfa5721ae960?ref=confluence)

- There should be one additional use case for the 1-time trigger in the public network
- The use case can be taken from the Sora voting system

[Nikita Puzankov](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/5df113768998970e5b434e0a?ref=confluence)

- The idea of triggers is very near to Iroha special instructions
  
  - Trigger is the structure which is a composition of 2 entities:
    
    - Condition
    - Transaction for execution (set of ISIs)
- Evgeniy: We can use additional parameters for the triggers to store "enabled" state, and perform garbage collection after they are disabled
  
  - We need to write down the scenario to comments
- [武宮誠](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/557058:12c320e6-5d17-404f-b20e-bfa5721ae960?ref=confluence) : Few words about the syntax for conditions: will it be like a batch
  
  - It will be like ISI DSL approach
  - [武宮誠](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/557058:12c320e6-5d17-404f-b20e-bfa5721ae960?ref=confluence) Let's create a list of examples
  - [武宮誠](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/557058:12c320e6-5d17-404f-b20e-bfa5721ae960?ref=confluence) We need to also consider the possibility of a chain of executions triggered one by one
  - It is one of our open questions – should triggers be able to be executed by other triggers?
    
    - Current proposal – do not fire any triggers as a result of transactions, which executed by triggers.
    - We need to have comments to add such possibility
    - There should be also the possibility to execute the trigger by explicit ISI
    - There is a possibility – to have some
    - [武宮誠](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/557058:12c320e6-5d17-404f-b20e-bfa5721ae960?ref=confluence) : It is quite a hard question, for Turing-completeness we need to think about allowing triggering triggers from other triggers
    - [武宮誠](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/557058:12c320e6-5d17-404f-b20e-bfa5721ae960?ref=confluence) We just probably need to wait for another block to execute trigger from another trigger, which will give us possibility to handle the situation
- [Yuriy Vinogradov](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/557058:0b85dbf9-2cc9-4bee-a3a0-2815e5bb51eb?ref=confluence) We may need to have loops in triggers
  
  - [Nikita Puzankov](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/5df113768998970e5b434e0a?ref=confluence) There is no possibility to have an infinite loop in the ISI, as it is counter-effective for execution
  - [Yuriy Vinogradov](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/557058:0b85dbf9-2cc9-4bee-a3a0-2815e5bb51eb?ref=confluence) The particular use case – distribution of tokens, which can take millions of executions of the trigger.
  - Evgeniy Zhukov: Probably we can use some safe recursion with formal verification
  - [Nikita Puzankov](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/5df113768998970e5b434e0a?ref=confluence) We need to have requirements and model for verification
  - [武宮誠](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/557058:12c320e6-5d17-404f-b20e-bfa5721ae960?ref=confluence) For initial release we can limit complexity by limiting that Triggers cannot trigger triggers, then we can go deeper into the research of languages and safety
  - [Ales Zivkovic](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/5b3a36d1d38a522e77ff78c0?ref=confluence) There is not about requirements, there is a non-functional security requirements. We need to develop protection from the hacker.
  - [Nikita Puzankov](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/5df113768998970e5b434e0a?ref=confluence) Yes, we can start with the limited functionality and then add additional security protection to caver extended functionality.
