- There are many irrelevant alerts in the longevity stand monitoring. It will be nice to add filters.
- Will take a look on the env vars configuration issue
- Fixed issues with signatures of artefacts
- LinuxONE server is running again; however, there is an issue in the Docker image condition
  
  - Will take a look; after the fix, we will merge the PR with Shepherd. Then "1.2.0-rc3" tag will be added.
- Proceeded with benchmarks. There is a non-trivial approach to the amount field in transferring operations.
  
  - Now looking how to make better handling of decimal numbers with predefined precision.
- We need a task for adding automation for LinuxONE compatible builds and releasing them to Docker Hub.
