- Regarding the Python library documentation – there is an issue with dependencies, now we need to add pynacl as an explicit dependency.
- Regarding the issue from partners, there is a known issue with the DB. However, we cannot meet the same situation in our testing environment.
  
  - The same problem was previously met by Mikhail.
  - [Andrei Lebedev](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/557058:c02f1b3d-42e6-4519-ba84-2d0476dccbc9?ref=confluence) : we tried to fix that issue before by catching all exceptions from the integrations with DB. The reason is always related to the loss of connection with the database which cannot be easily restored on the fly.
  - [Andrei Lebedev](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/557058:c02f1b3d-42e6-4519-ba84-2d0476dccbc9?ref=confluence) : The most complex part in switching to RocksDB is during the offloading blocks from the existing Postgres DB to the new one. We can create a script which will directly save blocks from the Postgres DB to the new RocksDB storage.
  - Let's make a piece of advice to our customers about how to overcome the problem.
- Regarding the network synchronization problem – not clear how this even happens.
- Talked with Ruslan about the performance testing. He is ready to join it
  
  - We will create initial scripts with the predefined configurations. Then we will meet and discuss.
  - Tomorrow will create a meeting to discuss
