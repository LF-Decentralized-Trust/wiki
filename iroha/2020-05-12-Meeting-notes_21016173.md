- Egor wanted to add channels to Sumeragi, but I did not agree with the proposal. He will prepare more documentation and we will proceed.
- Since the last status meeting, we had an internal demo with CLI demonstration. I will schedule the next demo this Friday. I will show the transfer of assets and usage of several Iroha peers.
- Touched async-std
- Refactored transaction state transitions. Now we have the compile-time guarantee that transactions and blocks are in the right state.
- Working on the ISI redesign, aligned with DSL structure provided by Makoto. I will make a PR with draft version to discuss probably today, after fixing compiler errors.
- I am a bit blocked by review of my previous PRs.

- Participated in several conferences.
- There are some thoughts on the Polkaswap and Iroha 2 integration.
- We had an external demo of Kagome, and now we are almost ready for another one after a check from the QA team.

- We agreed with [Nikita Puzankov](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/5df113768998970e5b434e0a?ref=confluence) about ideas of DSL, we will move forward with improvements. Design of DSL os very important, as it is going to be the main thing of Iroha 2.

[Egor Ivkov](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/5dd9631c1cf3c20ef5ff9f0f?ref=confluence) (offline)

- I suggested a few architectural changes to Sumeragi to decouple it, and we discussed it with Nikita.
