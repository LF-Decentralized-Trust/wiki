- We found some issue in the pointer counting, now it should be fixed
  
  - Using that counter we will finalize the memory leakage
- No updates on the DB performance issue for now
- There are some ideas of the problems with the initialization of the node after the restart. The idea that we need to revalidate all signatures.
  
  - We need to create a flag for performing "verbose initialization check" during startup
  - This can take around 2-3 days if we can reuse parts of the validation from the network layer
- Now we are going to finish the object counting together with [Михаил Болдырев](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/557058:584193b8-9303-4b5a-8cb3-8153294c8cc2?ref=confluence), and then divide for further issues.

- I agree with the distribution of responsibility. Will take care of the memory issue.

Stepan Lavrentev

- I have added the issue related to the initialization
- I have fixed the Locust image on the longevity stand, now it is working again. Currently, it is working without MST transaction.
  
  - I will try to run with MST and let the team know if the problem will repeat

[Sara Garifullina](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/5b6c115b2c9bd83c03707f95?ref=confluence)
