# Hyperledger Iroha : 2021-01-15 Community Meeting

Created by Sara Garifullina on Jan 15, 2021

## Expressions in Iroha v2

Presented by [Egor Ivkov](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/5dd9631c1cf3c20ef5ff9f0f?ref=confluence)

ISI is a smart contract language, instructions sent as transactions or triggers.

Originally, ISI had limitations and were always mutable. Expressions, on the other hand, are immutable and return a value. Raw values and queries can be executed. Any instructions can use expressions for different conditional logic.

See a use-case example for pure expressions on page 5 of the presentation, which is implemented by expressions on the ISI.

Another update: interledger protocols will not be in the first version. Iroha 2 should be ready for internal testing in around 2 months and in around 6 months ready.

## News on Iroha 1.2

Presented by Konrad from DIVA.EXCHANGE

### Tests on Iroha 1.2

Basically, 2 issues — synchronisation on slower networks and segmentation fault. Fixing is in progress.

Test network layout can be seen on page 3 of the presentation. 

### Fosdem 2021

DIVA.EXCHANGE team will present their solution on [https://fosdem.org/2021/](https://fosdem.org/2021/) and speak about Iroha too. The conference is open for everyone to attend. 

### Iroha logo is in Berlin

An independent artist made a picture of DIVA.EXCHANGE and Iroha logos for an exhibition of open-source projects (see the last page of the presentation).
