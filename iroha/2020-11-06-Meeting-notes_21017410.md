- Still working on the finalization of the synchronization issue
  
  - Today will proceed with it
- Currently working on the benchmark. The transfer is currently working correctly with all correct checks.
  
  - Currently, we have limitation to the "description" field – 100 kb. The length also can be changed to the stateful validation
  - Currently, we do not have a default value in the DB. Possibly, it is reasonable to make the default value equal to 64 symbols.
  - [Vadim Reutskiy](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/5b8d04b72786fb2bf79a7405?ref=confluence) Let's make default 64 symbols, to keep more careful backwards-capability

- Checked the possible issue related to the precision. If for AddAssetQuantity we are providing precision with 255, it can lead to the issue with the assets with less amount of precision. The same for transfer.
- Regarding building Ursa – dependency on "Go" language was only related to Burrow.
- Found solution to the issue with the usage of config files by changing entry point in the Docker image
- Regarding the Longevity stand – do we have a reason to keep it in the halted state?
  
  - After adding the needed files to the blockstore, the node was not started. There are no logs on operations.
  - [Andrei Lebedev](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/557058:c02f1b3d-42e6-4519-ba84-2d0476dccbc9?ref=confluence) will check it. But first, we need to restart the longevity in debug mode. Also, we will check, how it can happen in the "release" build

[Sara Garifullina](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/5b6c115b2c9bd83c03707f95?ref=confluence)

- Updated the link to the Iroha tutorial together with the HL
- Updated the link to the community meting – from now on it will be on Friday, the same time (14:30 MSK)
- We need a response from Baziorek about the ARM building
- Documentation on env variables on the review now
