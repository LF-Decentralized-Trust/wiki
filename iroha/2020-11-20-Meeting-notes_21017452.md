- Finally found a way how to make Iroha not stable after killing and restarting. The situation now repeated with the Postgres container which stuck in the strange state.
  
  - Most probably, now we can get the state when the WSV is ahead of the blockstore after the machine restart.
  - Will contact Andrey and we will check how it can be handled
- There are not all cases in Iroha-Python library covered.
  
  - We will need to discuss the approach of how to handle all dependencies which are left.
  - Need to have a consultation on that with Andrey
- Did not have time to switch on Iroha basic features regression yesterday, but will proceed today.
- Also, will collect information about the configuration of Iroha network for the performance testing from the Bakong project.
