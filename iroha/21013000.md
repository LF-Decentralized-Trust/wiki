# Hyperledger Iroha : 2021-08-13 Community meeting: Updates, discussion about storing private keys

Created by baziorek, last modified by Kamil Salakhiev on Aug 16, 2021

1. Iroha 1.3.0 when we finish testing and migration tools preparation
2. Last tests show that transactions per second for 4-peered network was about 350 tps for Postgres and about 1000 tps for RocksDB.
3. Pulling docker image: the support version (still not released but the most up-to-date) of Hyperledger Iroha with Hyperledger Burrow support:
   
   ```
   docker pull hyperledger/iroha-burrow:support-1.2.x
   ```
4. Bakong project: [successful cross board transactions](https://twitter.com/nbccambodia/status/1425677964956422147).
5. [baziorek](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/70121:fcfd1447-e409-47ac-bf14-f78e6031899d?ref=confluence) Started discussion: Where to store private keys for system used by many users, which have Iroha Accounts, but the system is using Iroha as Core? As a clue there are two possibilities:
   
   1. Users are having their private keys on their device.
      
      1. The key is generated on the device.
      2. We should never generate keys for users on centralized server. Because of [entropy problem](https://qvault.io/cryptography/what-is-entropy-in-cryptography/) (?)
      3. In centralized system: If user loose key we can generate new one (permissions: CanAddMySignatory and CanRemoveMySignatory).
   2. In decentralized system: Users have passwords, but their keys are stored in a special system which only has access to keys (e.g. logging with Google to secure application storage).
