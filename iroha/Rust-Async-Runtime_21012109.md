0.1.0

**Vision: Asynchronous programming in highly I\\O application like \`Iroha\` should give better utilization of hardware resources. Async runtimes can give better performance and some OOB functionality for futures handling.**

**Functional details: Rust provides an ability (via \`futures\` crate) to abstract over futures executing runtime.**

**Environmental objectives:** None

## Changelog

#Change descriptionAffected componentChange motivation1Async-std was introduced for several modules\`Kura\`, \`WSV\`

Start using of async programming in Iroha

## Research strategy

#Research activityDetailsAcceptance criteriaResponsible (accepter) 1Reading of Tokio vs Async-Std articles

Important aspects that were identified: 

- async-std has a safer layer of abstraction
- a lot of old libraries heavily depends on tokio

<!--THE END-->

- overhead (lower is better)
- OOB functionality (contains what we need)
- promising future (what runtime can become standard choice in a year)
