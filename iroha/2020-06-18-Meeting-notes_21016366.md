WhoNotes

[Nikita Puzankov](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/5df113768998970e5b434e0a?ref=confluence)

- Made changes in JSON serialization approach
- Changed keys representation in the system
- Make preparations to change to the multi hash approach
- Planning to finish migration to SergeJSON today
- Then will take a task with the multi hash for tomorrow

 [Kamil Salakhiev](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/557058:07723e0b-a027-4cc4-ad6d-324e41cccb4d?ref=confluence)

- We performed a good demo of the internal project
- Reviewing the situation and making RFCs for improvements
- There is a question: Torii is a single connection point now, but we should change it to make behaviour more logical
  
  - [Nikita Puzankov](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/5df113768998970e5b434e0a?ref=confluence) &gt; Please, write the RFC, because making Torii as a gateway was our design decision
- Regarding the TTL, we can consider RFC with transaction tags proposed by me

[Михаил Болдырев](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/557058:584193b8-9303-4b5a-8cb3-8153294c8cc2?ref=confluence)

- I am mostly on the 1.2.0 release preparation
- On Iroha, we made a separation between Torii for client requests and P2P communication. Then we had different bind addresses for different types of communication.

[Sara Garifullina](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/5b6c115b2c9bd83c03707f95?ref=confluence)

- Currently working on the RTD + MD documentation configuration

[Andrei Lebedev](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/557058:c02f1b3d-42e6-4519-ba84-2d0476dccbc9?ref=confluence)

- Discussed the approach to documentation with Sara.
- Will continue with the Python client library for 1.2.0

[Egor Ivkov](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/5dd9631c1cf3c20ef5ff9f0f?ref=confluence)

- Working on the signature validation and roles validation for Sumeragi consensus. It is finished, PR ready
- Started working on the version upgrade for Ursa-related libraries, sent PRs
- Will proceed with further TODO in the Sumeragi. On this week most of them will be finished. Then consensus will be more reliable.
- Then I will proceed with block synchronization

[武宮誠](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/557058:12c320e6-5d17-404f-b20e-bfa5721ae960?ref=confluence)

- There will be 2 talks about Iroha in India for developer groups. Will provide information about Iroha 2 so we can get more contributors.
- Probably, we will need to have a demo network for these presentations
- We can also need the Iroha 1 tutorial for using the client libraries
