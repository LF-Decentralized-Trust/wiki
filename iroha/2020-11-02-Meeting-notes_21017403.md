- Currently, we have a problem with the build of Iroha with tests, because of too much resource consuming.
  
  - Now I am trying to find a solution on how to minimize the memory consumption
  - The linker is currently taking too much memory, I am trying to analyze the situation with different tools
  - LinuxONE server has 8Gb of RAM, which is not enough
- Also, we have a PR with the update of the documentation, which needs to be merged to make CI finish successfully
- After finishing the problem with build memory consumption, will switch to the investigation of the problem with the longevity stand
  
  - Stepan: We have a month to get the data from Grafana before it becomes outdated
