- Opened draft on PR with query fix.
- Created "support/1.2" branch to work on the release finalization
- There is one finding of DDoS potential attack in the security audit report
  
  - This problem also does not have a fix in GRPC.
  - We need to check the PR with a p2p TLS and connection pool, it may fix the issue
  - However, there is no obvious solution to that problem for now on the Iroha side

- Currently, all PRs with 1.2 fixes are important, as they are solving issues in the newest update.
- Finishing the Securosys integration using PKCS11.
  
  - Need to fix one issue in the Utimaco integration. There are several EcDSA curves, but currently, Iroha selects the default one.
  - We need to find access to the SecuroSys environment to test the integration
- Today will have a call with HL interns who have delays in the results
- Will roll back fix of CompareAndSet command and instead of it will provide the new optional parameter with enum for old "wrong" logic and new "correct" one.

Robert Sayakhov

- Started update of the JS library
  
  - There is one "CallModule" command which has no docs.
  - [Михаил Болдырев](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/557058:584193b8-9303-4b5a-8cb3-8153294c8cc2?ref=confluence) &gt; It would not be included into 1.2.0, please skip it. It is for future updates, which are under construction for now.
  - There is a parameter "type" in the CallEngine request, what we should put here. No information in the documentation.
  - [Andrei Lebedev](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/557058:c02f1b3d-42e6-4519-ba84-2d0476dccbc9?ref=confluence) &gt; There is only one single value here, for Solidity. So, you can just skip it.
  - Is there any changes in Protofiles related to multi hash?
  - [Михаил Болдырев](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/557058:584193b8-9303-4b5a-8cb3-8153294c8cc2?ref=confluence) &gt; No, there just a new way of public key creation. For standard ED25519 we need to add a prefix.

Stephan Lavrentev

- Eugene helped with the Burrow documentation issue and Burrow was successfully tested.
  
  - There are some queries related to Burrow – there are also some changes between documentation and implementation. "GetEngineRecepients" is the problematic query. There is no command index and one internal parameter.
- There is one more problem found related to the migration to 1.2.0.
- Continuing with TLC
- Started load testing on longevity stand

## Action items

- [Vadim Reutskiy](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/5b8d04b72786fb2bf79a7405?ref=confluence) organize our own internal research of the issue with GRPC socket overload with security team and QA engineers
