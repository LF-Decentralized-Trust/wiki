# Hyperledger Iroha : Ideas for Summer Internship 2021

Created by Egor Ivkov, last modified on Feb 18, 2021

# Possible Projects

Here are some of the potential internship project ideas for Iroha2.

## Blockly Like Interface for ISIs.

### Description

Implement a visual blueprint frontend similar to [Blockly](https://developers.google.com/blockly), [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) or [Unreal Engine Blueprints](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/ProgrammingAndScripting/Blueprints/GettingStarted/index.html) for Iroha Special Instructions smart contract language.

### Requirements

1. UI/UX design familiarity
2. Frontend development (in the language of your choice) skills

## Language Syntax design for ISIs

### Description

Iroha Instructions and Expressions represent a syntactical tree. It is not very convenient for users to compose this tree. Therefore it is proposed to design a programming language syntax that will be parsed into this tree. As part of this project, it will be needed to design a syntax, write a parser and optionally add syntax support into VS Code (with language server).

### Requirements

1. Knowledge of compiler construction theory (Lexical and Syntactical analysis primarily)
2. Passion for language design

## Iroha2 Privacy Focus Research

### Description

Research zk-snarks, ring signatures and their usage in popular privacy oriented blockchains and protocols (ZCash, CryptoNote). Design an MVP implementation for confidential transactions for Iroha2.

### Requirements

1. Familiarity with blockchains
2. Interest in cryptography
3. Willing to research scientific papers and apply them to real world use case

## Quantum Resistant Cryptography

### Description

Research the state of Quantum resistant cryptography and implement an MVP of its support in Iroha2.

### Requirements

1. Interest in cryptography
2. Willing to research scientific papers and apply them to real world use case

## Sharding Research

### Description

Research sharding and design consensus improvements for Iroha2 to support sharding. Test the scalability and performance of this solution.

### Requirements

1. Familiarity with blockchains
2. Interest in distributed computing and consensus design

## Topic

### Description

### Requirements
