WhoNotesStepan Lavrentev

- Started testing of the fix for the WSV-blockstore synchronization.
  
  - Locust is currently running, so we need to wait for the situation to appear again.
- Has checked the issue with the build problems. There are some dependencies, which should be explicitly stated in the documentation.
- Checked community-reported security problem.
  
  - The reported sequence cannot be repeated, hence we can consider that issue is done
  - However, I am looking also for similar behavior which can lead to inconsistency
