- Performed a meeting with Diva Exchange company about the feedback related to the Iroha 1.2.0 stability.
  
  - Konrad will provide extended logs about the problem which they found.
  - Seems like that the issues are related to GRPC usage in Iroha.

- Will continue getting data and analysing the reason for GRPC problem.
- WIll try to finalize the solution for the issue with peer crash on startup because of "future" votes.
