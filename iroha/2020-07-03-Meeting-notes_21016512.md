- There is no response from the SecuroSys regarding the integration. Questions are following:
  
  - How we should integrate SDK with C++ apps?
  - Can we get specifications/instructions of how to use their library?
  - [Sara Garifullina](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/5b6c115b2c9bd83c03707f95?ref=confluence) &gt; I will try to get help with SecuroSys communication

- Discussed the document with Data Model Abstraction description
  
  - Decided that we would not do the query, as it is too much for the intern capacity
  - Decided that we will start with simple test module of data model on Python. I will start with that interface.
  - Opened PR in master in the aim to avoid huge trunks with many lines of code
- For environment variables task we already found a library, so we need to parse our configuration file first.
- Stepan added some details to the tasks.
  
  - [Sara Garifullina](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/5b6c115b2c9bd83c03707f95?ref=confluence) &gt; Also, he requested the more detailed information about the reuse WSV.
  - We can take information from the MD file in the migration folder
