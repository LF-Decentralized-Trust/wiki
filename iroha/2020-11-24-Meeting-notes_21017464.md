- Alexander helped with the block synchronization commit. Waiting for the CI then will merge
- There was a small issue for building for macOS, we fixed it together with Sofiane.
- Today will take care of merging PRs into "support" branch. Also, will take care of merging support into the master branch.
  
  - Baziorek added documentation of building Iroha on the Raspberry, will take a look at the details. There is some room for improvements.

- Regarding the logger configuration, levels are working correctly. However, the verbosity can be overridden by the config, which does not seem correct in some cases.
  
  - Patterns are not working correctly – they are applying only to the log level which is stated in the config.
  - [Andrei Lebedev](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/557058:c02f1b3d-42e6-4519-ba84-2d0476dccbc9?ref=confluence) : be careful with TRACE level, as there are not so many messages on that level.
  - [Andrei Lebedev](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/557058:c02f1b3d-42e6-4519-ba84-2d0476dccbc9?ref=confluence) : in the description of the feature, it is said, that pattern should override lower levels. We have an arrangement of levels in the documentation.
- Currently, I am working on the general regression of the commands.
- I have experimented with the config of Iroha, and I faced that some parameters are very dependent on network configuration.
- [Andrei Lebedev](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/557058:c02f1b3d-42e6-4519-ba84-2d0476dccbc9?ref=confluence) : We need to check from the DevOps team about the M1 Apple machines.
- I will finish the regress at Thursday.
