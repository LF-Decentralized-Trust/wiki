Created by kellycooper.2ds, last modified on Aug 16, 2019

[https://wiki.hyperledger.org/polls/viewpoll.action?guid=4f5df59d23904f25b87527d2e8ac6ab0](https://wiki.hyperledger.org/polls/viewpoll.action?guid=4f5df59d23904f25b87527d2e8ac6ab0)

This link goes to a poll. Does this work or did you want the poll to appear in the main page? If so, it's not in the Hyperledger template and I can request it to be so. What other types of additions are you interested in?
