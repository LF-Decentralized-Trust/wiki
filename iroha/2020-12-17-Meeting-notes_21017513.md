- Set up the system with shaper between two nodes. The current channel is 1 Kb/sec. Then Iroha start work in strange mode. 
  
  - After async GRPC we are making "finish" action. Even on a slow channel, everything works well
  - However, 1 block there is applying in 3 seconds. And in specific situation ordering gate can not get proposals. Probably it is related to packet loss.
  - Will try to continue testing with more significant packet loss.
  - There is an open question – how the network will behave in case of 10 nodes, where 4 of them are with a bad connection.
  - Still looking for the source of that problem. There was one idea, but it was not approved.
- My plan: understand the place when Iroha halts on 2 nodes, and then prepare the special build for Konrad to check on his network.
