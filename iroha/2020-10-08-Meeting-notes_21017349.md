- Did not found a quick way to fix the issue with memory consumption, hence we will stay with the fix
- Mikhail started finalization of the environment variables setup
- I am currently working on the solution to the initialization verification, which will fix the problem with a corrupted block store.
  
  - I assume that it will need another day on the solution because I will need to reuse an existing solution and add some changes in it to cover required case
  - We do not have signatures to the genesis, so the genesis block attack will be possible anyway
- JS library is not updated – currently, it does not support the pagination. 
  
  - We need to also check that functionality in other libraries
- Sara, I have updated the PR with the documentation change

- There were some questions regarding the Iroha-Java library. I am working on coordination and improving communication.
- Tomorrow I will present the Bakong in the HL group.
