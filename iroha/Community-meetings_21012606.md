# Hyperledger Iroha : Community meetings

Created by Sara Garifullina, last modified by Victor Gridnevsky on Jun 16, 2023

We have our community meetings bi-weekly. Everyone is welcome! 

In these meetings, we (maintainers) discuss projects, answer questions and do our best to demonstrate new features or present some new ideas. 

If you have a project on Iroha and want to present it, you are always welcome; just let us know using any convenient communication channel. 

When: Every second week, on Friday, at noon CET. 

Where: [https://meet.jit.si/Iroha\_biweekly](https://meet.jit.si/Iroha_biweekly)
