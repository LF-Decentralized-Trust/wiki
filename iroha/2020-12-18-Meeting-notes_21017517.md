  - [iceseer](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/557058:4990bcb6-a037-4038-8a49-fdcc925bfb4f?ref=confluence) is working on it

- Checked logs of Konrad again to get information about the context
  
  - Found the timer thread, which halted on the sending votes. It leads to the state when the node is only sending votes without receiving anything.
  - Node was in that state for 22 minutes.
  - Seems like that it is directly related to the problem in network communication. A single node is blocking other nodes to work correctly.
  - We need to understand the behaviour of threads in different nodes. Currently, I am working on Iroha architecture analysis and find the reason for halt.
