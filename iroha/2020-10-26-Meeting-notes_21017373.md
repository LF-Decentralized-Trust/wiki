- Executed CI on the PR with environment variables – need to be fixed before the merge, one test on Windows is not working.
  
  - Will take it, as there are no Windows on the Mikhail side
- I have finished the current version of storage benchmarks, ready to review the results
  
  - RocksDB support now is partially finished (functionally few commands are working now, enough to collect first data)
- There is also some technical debt, which causes a very long time of building. Planning to fix the transitive dependencies by refactoring.
- Planning to update the  documentation on YAC functionality, to make it up-to-date.
