# Hyperledger Iroha : Migration from Strings

Created by Nikita Puzankov on Jun 18, 2020

## Abstract

Researching request about \`no-std\` client we found that usage of dynamically sized types such as Strings in our data model will need to work with different allocators on embedded devices or inside WASM runtimes.

After looking on our code we listed the following items as pros of Strings replacement with fixed-size structures:

- Out of the Box \`no-std\` support
- Usage of stack instead of the heap
- Prevention of memory losses on malicious behavior

As a proposal we can stick to fixed sized arrays of \`ASCII\` characters for Domain's, Account's and other entities names. 256 or 512 characters should be enough for the start.
