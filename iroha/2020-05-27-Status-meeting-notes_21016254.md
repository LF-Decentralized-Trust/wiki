- Nothing significant was found in the Burrow query
- There are few minor issues, so the decision about a Burrow is "go"
- Will proceed with other PRs review and merge into the master
  
  - Will start with the consensus issue review
- Will check PRs for "1.2" milestone tag
- Found the issue in grantable permissions and root permissions in SQL request

- Finished the review of own part of Burrow PR
- Fixed most of the issues found in Burrow PR
  
  - There are some questions to discuss regarding the requested issues
- Will continue with issues in the Burrow Query
- Need to take some additional tasks for review

[Andrei Lebedev](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/557058:c02f1b3d-42e6-4519-ba84-2d0476dccbc9?ref=confluence)  

- Finished the part of Burrow logic with Ametsuchi. Everything is looking well, there are no problems with the shared model.
- Will take a look on Go part
- After that – we can merge Burrow
- Fixed "floating" bug and test for the peer addition
- We had some issue with memory on the CI step, DevOps has proposed some solution, we need to check it and fix the script
  
  - [iceseer](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/557058:4990bcb6-a037-4038-8a49-fdcc925bfb4f?ref=confluence) &gt; I have found the reason, it is most probably caused after update of GCC to v10.1. If there are 2 threads active everything is going well.
  - Andrey will take a look and fix it, so the CI will work better
- Then will proceed with the review of phantom MST transactions, WSV reuse and so on

[Sara Garifullina](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/5b6c115b2c9bd83c03707f95?ref=confluence)

- Fixed broken tests for smart contract execution
- Fixed two smart contracts which are testing the Burrow execution as a whole
  
  - There is a need to improve the Burrow tests to make them more complex and cover more logic
