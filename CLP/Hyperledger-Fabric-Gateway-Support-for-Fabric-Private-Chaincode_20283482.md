# Collaborative Learning Program : Hyperledger Fabric Gateway Support for Fabric Private Chaincode

Created by Marcus Brandenburger, last modified by Min Yu on May 19, 2023

**Project Title**

Hyperledger Fabric Gateway Support for Fabric Private Chaincode

**Status**

CLP

**Primary Focus**

CODING   

# Description

Fabric Private Chaincode (FPC) leverages modern Confidential Computing technology, such as Intel SGX, to enhance the protection of chaincode and their data while executed at the endorsing peers. Client applications interact with their private chaincode via the FPC Client SDK, which is responsible to encrypt and authenticate the invocation arguments before being sent to the endorsing peers. However, the FPC Client SDK currently does not support the new Fabric Gateway API that simplifies the transaction flow for the clients.

The goal of this mentorship project is the design and the implementation of the FPC Client SDK using the new Fabric Gateway API. This also includes the creation of appropriate samples and documentation. The project requires a solid understanding of theory and practice of software development using Golang, distributed systems, and security. During the project you will get hands-on experience with the deployment of Fabric networks, the transaction lifecycle, confidential computing technology.
