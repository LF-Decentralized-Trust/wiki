The Hyperledger Collaborative Learning Program (CLP) is a pilot program to connect those interested in mentoring with those seeking guided open source contribution experience. This is an extension of the regular [Hyperledger Mentorship Program](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/INTERN/Hyperledger+Mentorship+Program) to offer additional mentoring resources to expand the number of new contributors receiving mentoring and guidance to enter the community and to become a productive active contributor to the Hyperledger open source community.

Similar to the framework put in place for the Hyperledger Mentorship Program:

- Mentees will apply and be matched with mentors and collaboratively they will work on mentorship projects with defined goals and learning outcomes.
- Mentors and mentees will collaborate remotely from their location of choice.
- Regular evaluation and feedback are to be built into the collaborative learning journey.
- At the end the participation, mentors and mentees will have the opportunity to showcase their learnings and contributions through blogging, speaking at meetups or regional events, or travel to a global Hyperledger event to present their work in person and network with others in the broader community.

Unlike the Hyperledger Mentorship Program:

- Mentees in the Collaborative Learning Program will ***not*** be offered a stipend.
- Mentors and mentees have a greater degree of flexibility and autonomy to collaboratively develop their project plans, milestones, and evaluation and feedback process.
