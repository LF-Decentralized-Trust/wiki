**Primary Focus**

CODING    RESEARCH

# Description

BDLS consensus protocol is a BFT protocol that has been approved and hosted in the Hyperledger Lab to be integrated into Hyperledger Fabric for consideration as one of the ordering service BFT protocols. BDLS is an innovative BFT consensus algorithm that features safety and liveness by presenting a mathematically proven secure BFT protocol that is resilient in open networks such as the Internet. BDLS overcomes many problems, such as DoS attacks and the deadlock problem caused by unreliable p2p broadcast channels. These problems are all very relevant to existing realistic open network scenarios and are the focus of extensive work in improving Internet security. Still, it is an area largely ignored by most in mainstream BFT protocol design.

# Learning Objectives

Consensus algorithm mechanism, Distributed messaging system, ability to integrate new consensus algorithm in the Orderer service of Fabric 

# Expected Outcome

BDLS consensus protocol is a BFT protocol that has been submitted for consideration to be integrated into Hyperledger Fabric as an ordering service.

# Relation to Hyperledger

Fabric core, [https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/bdls](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/bdls)

# Mentee Skills

Go,  (Raft is a plus)

# Mentee Open Source Contribution Experience

# Future plans

support and maintain the new BFT protocol in Fabric core, ability to use the BDLS in other platforms
