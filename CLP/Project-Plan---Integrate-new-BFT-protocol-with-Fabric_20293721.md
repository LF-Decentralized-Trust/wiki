# Collaborative Learning Program : Project Plan - Integrate new BFT protocol with Fabric

Created by Ahmed Alsalih, last modified on Feb 07, 2024

# Abstract

This project aims to integrate a new BFT consensus protocol into the Hyperledger Fabric's orderer service and understand the orderer node's implementation, run the Fabric network using a sample chain code, and collect performance data to accomplish the program goal successfully. We will use BDLS protocol, an innovative BFT consensus algorithm that features safety and liveness by presenting a mathematically proven secure BFT protocol that is resilient in open networks.
