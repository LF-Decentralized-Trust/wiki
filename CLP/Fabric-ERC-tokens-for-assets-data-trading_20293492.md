# Collaborative Learning Program : Fabric ERC tokens for assets data trading

Created by Nikos Kapsoulis, last modified by Min Yu on May 19, 2023

**Project Title**Fabric ERC tokens for assets data trading**Status**

CLP

**Primary Focus**

CODING DOCUMENTATION  RESEARCH

# Description

Current project aims at the development of an integrated data trading workflow that spans across different stakeholder roles and enables the applicability of configurable trading on permissioned Fabric networks adopting the dedicated ERC token standards.

Assets' data trading across blockchain networks contributes to the deployment and maintenance of financial data handling mechanisms, such as data pricing and monetization schemes, established in decentralized permissioned networks. In this context, different asset stakeholders are able to trade data assets or their metadata in order to back such financial schemes, while allowing the development of an interconnected economy that secures handling of financial data along with decentralized data ownership and trading.

The main objective of the project is to explore the suitability and applicability of Hyperledger Fabric ERC token standards on an integrated data trading workflow backing data pricing and monetization of data assets information. The project development will deploy the necessary components and integration modules in order to address key features for the data trading workflow of assets belonging to dissimilar stakeholders. Each stakeholder will be able to permit their assets joining the developed ecosystem while being continuously informed for the assets activity.
