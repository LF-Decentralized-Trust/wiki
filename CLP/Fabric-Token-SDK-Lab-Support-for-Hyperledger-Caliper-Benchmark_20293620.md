**Project Title**

Fabric Token SDK Lab Support for Hyperledger Caliper Benchmark

**Status**

CANCELLED

**Primary Focus**

CODING   RESEARCH

# Description

The Fabric Token SDK allows developers to create token-based distributed applications on Hyperledger Fabric. While the Fabric Token SDK offers many features (i.e., configurable privacy, p2p transaction orchestration, atomic swaps, and audits,...), performance is yet another important aspect. The Hyperledger Caliper project is a blockchain performance benchmark framework, which allows the evaluation of blockchain solutions. How about using Caliper to benchmark token-based applications built on top of the Fabric Token SDK?

The goal of this mentorship project is the design and the implementation of a Caliper plugin to evaluate applications using the Fabric Token SDK. This includes the creation of appropriate documentation and performance evaluation of sample applications. The project requires a solid understanding of theory and practice of software development using Golang and Node.JS, distributed systems, and performance benchmarking. During the project you will get hands-on experience with the deployment of Fabric networks, the transaction lifecycle, the Fabric Token SDK, and Hyperledger Caliper.
