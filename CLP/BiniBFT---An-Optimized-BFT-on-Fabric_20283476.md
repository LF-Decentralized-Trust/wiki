# Problem Statement

The current existing implementation of Hyperledger Fabric with Raft consensus has many shortcomings such as transaction censorship and no mechanism to safeguard the network if a malicious leader gets elected. The network also has limitations on scalability which restrict the type of use cases that can be built such as real-time applications that use IoT devices. This impedes blockchain adoption and limits the type of applications and use cases that can be built on Fabric.

# Description

The goal of this project is to build BiniBFT, a Byzantine Fault Tolerance consensus library for Hyperledger Fabric which provides end-to-end security, high throughput with low latency and high scalability so that Fabric can be applicable for distributed and decentralized day-to-day applications.
