# Collaborative Learning Program : Design and Spec DIDMan based openwallet

Created by Arun Prakash, last modified by Vinod Panicker on Jun 21, 2023

**Project Title**Design and Spec DIDMan based openwallet**Status**

CLP

**Primary Focus**

CODING DOCUMENTATION  RESEARCH

# Description

Designing an open wallet based on the DIDMan specification requires consideration of several key components. These include authentication, DID management, cryptographic operations, interoperability, user interface, security, and backup and recovery. The [OpenWallet](https://openwallet.foundation/) must have a secure authentication mechanism and support the DIDMan specification to manage DIDs, their associated keys, and metadata. The wallet must also support cryptographic operations, have a user-friendly interface, ensure security, and allow for backup and recovery. By adhering to the DIDMan specification, the wallet can ensure interoperability with other compliant systems and promote the adoption of decentralized identity technologies.

# Additional Information

The project  [DRman](https://github.com/DIDman/DRman) has an end goal of developing a stand-alone utility to provision Verifiable Credential Registries \[VCR]. The utility can also be used to administer the registry containing credentials issued by the organizations.  The functionalities like creation, verification, modification, and revocation of credentials, form the core of this project as it enables the administrator to manage the VCR with ease. 

The significant aspects to be considered here are Creation, Onboarding (Enable/Restrict Access) of members, and Management(add/update/revoke) of DIDs.

a) Creation (of DID Registry): Function to create a DID Registry for an organization on Git. 

b) Onboarding: Function to add enable/restrict access to members of an organization to a repository (e.g., using a combination of GitHub private tokens, GitHub username &amp; users DID). 

c) Manage: Function to list APIs that are needed to add/update/revoke access DID’s or (DID Document) saved as files on the repo.

# Learning Objectives

1. Develop an understanding of decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and their role in decentralized identity systems.
2. Understand the DIDMan specification and its APIs and data structures for managing DIDs and associated keys and metadata.
3. Acquire the skills to design and implement an openwallet that adheres to the DIDMan specification.
4. Gain experience in performing cryptographic operations for secure key generation, signing, and verification of transactions.
5. Develop a user-friendly interface for the openwallet that allows users to easily navigate and interact with its features.
6. Learn to prioritize security in the design and development of decentralized identity systems.
7. Understand the importance of interoperability in promoting the adoption of decentralized identity technologies.
8. Cultivate a sense of responsibility towards protecting the sensitive information of users.
9. Demonstrate the ability to contribute to articles, blog posts, or white papers related to decentralized identity and DIDMan specification.

# Expected Outcome

1. The expected outcomes of designing and spec-ing an [OpenWallet](https://openwallet.foundation/) based on the DIDMan specification include developing a deep understanding of decentralized identity systems, gaining practical experience in implementation and cryptography, and prioritizing security and user experience.
2. Additionally, students can expect to learn about interoperability, open-source contribution, technical documentation, and real-world applications.
3. By achieving these outcomes, students will be equipped with the skills and knowledge needed to make meaningful contributions to the growing field of decentralized identity technologies.

# Relation to Hyperledger

The project's use of the DIDMan specification aligns with the goals of Hyperledger Indy, a distributed ledger technology for decentralized identity solutions.

# Mentee Skills

Graduate or master's students preferred. Please do take a look at the skills needed for DRman ,OpenWallet.

# Future plans

Integrate with the DRMan and make it production ready
