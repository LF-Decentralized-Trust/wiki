# Description

Current project targets privacy preservation developing modular tools for data sharing while envisioning the deployment of the necessary future blockchain and smart contract processes in the domain of Service Level Agreements (SLAs) evaluation.

Service Level Agreements (SLAs) define the way that service and infrastructure providers are making available products to their clientele, for example, the dedicated agreements for Public Cloud Infrastructure As A Service. An SLA is an accurately defined contract involving the specified service level objectives (SLOs) and contractual guarantees that are promised to be delivered to clients by the providers of the service or infrastructure. Particularly, monitoring of SLAs determines whether a provider meets an SLA's contractual terms or otherwise breaches of the agreement unfold. SLA breaches lead to definite violations of the terms, namely SLA Violations, as described in the contract. Ultimately, contractual definitions and parameter values computations vary across different provider setups, e.g. Telecom, 5G, Edge, and Cloud.

The main objective of the project is to develop privacy preservation through trusted execution environments, zero-knowledge proofs, or ring signatures for the corresponding transactional operations of SLAs assessment under a modular data sharing scheme on Hyperledger Fabric. The applicable deployment and engagement with such architectural elements of privacy leads the current project to preserve and secure data privacy with configured transparency that regards SLA related data being populated among agreement participants. Therefore, the result framework respects data privacy and enables operation building on top of the distributed SLA monitoring and computation intelligence in order to nurture holistically data protection along the SLA ecosystem procedures.
