Created by Ry Jones, last modified on Jun 08, 2022

**[Blockchain Automation Framework](https://www.hyperledger.org/blog/2020/07/14/how-to-quickly-deploy-blockchain-networks-that-can-scale-to-production-with-blockchain-automation-framework-a-hyperledger-lab) (BAF) is a Hyperledger Labs project that is creating an automation framework for rapidly and consistently deploying production-ready DLT platforms.  Learn more in this short 7 minute video.**

 

# **You are welcome to get involved!**

[Hyperledger](https://www.hyperledger.org/), as part of the  [Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/), is an open source community and anyone who is interested is welcome to use the code, talk to others in the community and make contributions to this project.

**Some useful links to get you started:**

- [Blockchain Automation Framework GitHub wiki](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/blockchain-automation-framework/wiki)
- [Blockchain Automation Framework technical documentation](https://blockchain-automation-framework.readthedocs.io/en/develop/introduction.html)
- [Blockchain Automation Framework chat channel](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/blockchain-automation-framework)
- [Blockchain Automation Framework Learning map](https://rise.articulate.com/share/vBSqnL6LswQuA_AlDD2OOrJT1nEY4Lba#/)

**Let us make your contribution journey easier.**

## **First become a user - deploy your DLT network using BAF**

Use the following flow to navigate the available resources.
