Hello everyone! My name is Carlos Regala and I am an incoming second year student taking my master's degree for Computer Science at De La Salle University Manila in the Philippines. I am passionate about web development and UI/UX design but I have recently started getting into backend technologies and working with machine learning models. 

I have previously interned as a software developer where I worked on developing interactive UI components for a sports betting web app using React. I helped integrate a machine learning backend model using a Flask server and experienced working with Docker build images for deployment and hosting using Amazon elastic containers like EC2. A lot of the tasks I had to work on were completely new to me and I found it challenging at first, but eventually I found it extremely rewarding and fun to learn so many new technlogies. I had to push myself outside of my comfort zone and learn how to be adaptable and become a fast learner. I believe this experience will be helpful for this project moving forward. 

My LinkedIn page can be found at [www.linkedin.com/in/jose-carlos-regala](http://www.linkedin.com/in/jose-carlos-regala) and I can be contacted through my email at [josecarlosregala@gmail.com](mailto:josecarlosregala@gmail.com). I look forward to working with you all!
