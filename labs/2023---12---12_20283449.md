**Agenda:**

- Open Issues
- Q&amp;A

**Notes:**

1. Around ADR, we need specific frameworks and implementations in place to ensure the minimizations around bad implementations.
2. A decision was made to write a security policy and add to repo ([SECURITY.md](http://SECURITY.md))
3. Capturing the vulnerabilities of a project during it’s lifetime is very interesting
4. Dependency track is also an interesting open sourced software from the OWASP foundation

**Questions**:

1. How do we make it easier for people to report bugs?
2. Thinking about step 3 - could this also be done with threat modeling as part of a PR?
3. What exploration have we made into the aries test harness?
