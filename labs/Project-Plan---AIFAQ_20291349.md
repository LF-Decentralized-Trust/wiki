# Hyperledger Labs : Project Plan - AIFAQ

Created by Gianluca Capuzzi, last modified on Jun 26, 2024

## **Abstract**

Hyperledger Labs AIFAQ is an LLM ChatBot testable as a Proof-of-Concept. It replies to questions about Hyperledger standard documentation. The current version is a Google Colab Notebook which uses Gradio as GUI. This project proposes an implementation of a standard ChatBot GUI and the deployment of a prototype. Our end goal is to have a more usable system installed on a Cloud Server.
