## Developer Documentation

TBD

## Technical Documentation

**I have created a template/demo repository for technical documentation:**

- **repo: [https://github.com/jaredweinfurtner/docs-project-layout](https://github.com/jaredweinfurtner/docs-project-layout)**
  
- **generated documentation: [https://jaredweinfurtner.github.io/docs-project-layout](https://jaredweinfurtner.github.io/docs-project-layout/)**

For technical documentation, a user should not have to browse through the code repository on GitHub.  The user should also have many options to read the technical documentation: Easily navigatable web page, PDF, ePub for eReaders, etc.  The following is a proposal on how to approach technical documentation that is simple for contributors to manage the documentation and simple for readers to take in. 

### Sphinx

Sphinx is a tool that allows us to create documentation using simple markup languages and generate multiple output formats: HTML, LaTeX, PDF, Confluence, ePub, and plain text.  It has an easy to understand hierarchical structure with automatic indices. More importantly, it has a large community building plugins &amp; extensions.

To learn more, visit: [https://www.sphinx-doc.org](https://www.sphinx-doc.org)

#### Plugins/Extensions

The power of Sphinx is in its plugin support.  We are currently using 4 plugins to make life easier for a contributor:

- `sphinx_rtd_theme` - Read *the* Docs ([https://docs.readthedocs.io](https://docs.readthedocs.io)) is used quite a bit in the open-source community and providing a familiar experience using their theme with our documentation for users and contributors has obvious benefits.
- `sphinxcontrib-drawio` - This allows direct reference of `*.drawio` files directly within the documentation, so no need to export as png every time you make a simple edit eliminating the chance of out-of-sync files and images.
  
  - reStructuredText:
    
    ```
    .. drawio-figure:: my-awesome-model.drawio
    ```
  - Markdown:
    
    ````
    ```{drawio-figure} my-awesome-model.drawio
```
    ````
- `myst-parser` - By default, Sphinx uses [reStructuredText](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html) (another markup language similar to Markdown).  This plugin allows Markdown support within Sphinx to make it easier to those not wanting to learn *another* language. For more information, please see: [https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- `sphinxcontrib-plantuml` - similar to the drawio plugin.  It allows PlantUML files to be directly referenced in the documentation.

There are so many more plugins that we can use to make our life easier since documentation is never anyone's favorite task:  [https://github.com/sphinx-contrib/](https://github.com/sphinx-contrib/)

#### Docker

It is often necesseary to generate the documentation locally to verify your changes before commiting.  To make life easier for a contributor, I have packaged all of the installation, plugins, and configurations in a docker image so that the same container that builds the documentation locally is the same container that the CI environment builds for deployment. 

Source: [https://github.com/jaredweinfurtner/sphinx-drawio-docker](https://github.com/jaredweinfurtner/sphinx-drawio-docker)  
Docker Hub: [https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/jaredweinfurtner/sphinx-drawio-docker](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/jaredweinfurtner/sphinx-drawio-docker)

Simply run the following in the `/docs` folder to generate the static html with the Read *the* Docs theme:

```
docker run --rm -v `pwd`:/docs jaredweinfurtner/sphinx-drawio-docker make html
```

### Structure

Inside the /docs folder, the following structure is proposed:

```
build
│
├───html
│   ├─  ...
│   └─  index.html
│      
└───latex
    ├─  ...
    └─  docs-project-layout.pdf

source
│   ├─ index.rst    
│   └─ conf.py
│
├───section
│   ├─  overview.md
│   └─  my-drawing.drawio
│   
└───section
    ├─  overview.md
    └─  my-drawing.drawio
```

**`/build/**`** Contains generated documentation and should be ignored via .gitignore

`/build/html/**`Contains static html that can be deployed as any other static html site - for example to: [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org/), [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), etc

**`/build/latex/**`**  
Contains mainly cached files for quicker follow-up generation of the pdf, but your \*.pdf should be buried in here somewhere

**`/source/index.rst|md`** This is your landing page and should contain the tree structure of your documentation. I highly recommend separating each section &amp; subsection into its own folder so that you can include any diagrams alongside the .rst file.

**`/source/conf.py`** This is the Sphinx configuration file and is the only thing you need to copy &amp; configure into your own project. Simply set the properties listed at the top for your particular project:

```
# -- Project information -----------------------------------------------------

project = 'My Awesome Project'
author = 'Max Mustermann'
copyright = '© 1984-2021 Max Mustermann'

# The full version, including alpha/beta/rc tags
release = '0.0.1'
```

### GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages offers static html hosting of our generated Sphinx documentation with the ReadTheDocs theme.  It nicely binds the project's GitHub repo with technical documentation so the user experience is seamless.  It offers automatic publishing by designating a git branch and a subfolder that contains the documentation (i.e. `docs`branch with a `/docs` subfolder).  Normally GitHub uses Markdown to generate the documentation, but it doesn't have the capabilities of Sphinx plugin support (such as [draw.io](http://draw.io), PlantUML, PDF support).

For more information, please see: [https://pages.github.com](https://pages.github.com/)

#### Compatibility with Sphinx

Out-of-the-box GitHub Pages is not compatible with Sphinx structure; however, it is easily fixed.  To configure GitHub pages to simply host the statically generated Sphinx documentation (instead of its own processing/theme), we simply add an empty **`.nojekyll`** file in the `/docs` folder. There's even an extension **`sphinx.ext.githubpages`** that takes care of that automatically ([example](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/perun-doc/blob/master/source/conf.py#L44)).

### Build / Deployment

It is good standard practice to never check-in generated code to a git repo, so we do not check-in the generated Sphinx html from our local environments.  Therefore, it is necessary to generate the documentation (static html) in a CI environment and push it to the `docs`branch under the `/docs` folder so that GitHub Pages can automatically deploy it.

#### GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions is GitHub's CI system (think Jenkins) and allows us to trigger our static html generation whenever a change is made to the master branch.  We simply generate the static html via the same docker command we use locally during development, move the static html to the root /docs folder for GitHub Pages, add the .nojekyll to tell GitHub Pages to simply host our own static html.

Example GitHub Action for GitHub Pages integration (example result: [https://jaredweinfurtner.github.io/docs-project-layout/](https://jaredweinfurtner.github.io/docs-project-layout/)):

**doc-generation.yml**
