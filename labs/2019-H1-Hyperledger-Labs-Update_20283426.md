# Hyperledger Labs : 2019 H1 Hyperledger Labs Update

Created by Ry Jones, last modified on Jul 15, 2019

Total Labs: **24 (22 active, 2 archived)**

# Overall Health

The labs are suffering from a lack of attention. Several labs have not had any commits the first half of 2019, and should probably be archived.

We have attracted many new contributions, some of the existing labs see a lot of continued activity.

Contributions to the labs continue to flow in not only from people associated with the larger projects, but also from newer participants.

We are also exploring the different metrics around commits and their frequency to surface the community health of the labs in general and individual labs in particular. We are open to suggestions on how to improve the labs on-boarding, especially from contributors who have gone through the acceptance process.
