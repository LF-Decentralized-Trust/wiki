### Conclusion

The name "NEXUS" is widely used in multiple sectors, especially in technology (telecom and data services), healthcare, finance, and even the entertainment industry. This widespread use could pose challenges for securing the name as a trademark for your product in the blockchain space unless you find a distinctive application for the term.

Trademarking a name like "NEXUS" for your AIFAQ Hyperledger product requires careful due diligence and a well-structured approach, as "NEXUS" is a common term and likely used by various companies across different industries. Here's an outline of the steps you need to take to assess the viability and secure the trademark:

### 1. **Conduct a Trademark Search**

- **Search the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO)**: You can search the USPTO’s Trademark Electronic Search System (TESS) to see if "NEXUS" is already registered or pending for use in a related industry.
  
  - Make sure to search not just for "NEXUS" alone but also any variations (e.g., NEXXUS, NXUS, etc.).
- **Search internationally**: If you plan to market AIFAQ internationally, you should also search databases like the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) or the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO).
- **Third-party trademark services**: You may want to hire a specialized service to conduct an in-depth search, including common law uses and non-registered uses.

### 2. **Determine the Relevant Classifications**

- Trademarks are registered by specific "classes" of goods and services. You need to decide which class best describes your AIFAQ Hyperledger product. For example:
  
  - **Class 9**: Software products, blockchain technology, etc.
  - **Class 42**: Software as a Service (SaaS), IT consulting, blockchain services, etc.
- Ensure that no other "NEXUS" marks exist in the classes that align with your product offering.

### 3. **Check for Existing Common Law Use**

- Even if a company hasn’t registered a trademark, it may still have common law rights to the name if they’ve used it in commerce. Check business directories, online platforms, and industry databases to ensure that no one else is using the name NEXUS in your field.

### 4. **Assess the Strength of the Mark**

- The more distinctive a trademark is, the easier it is to protect. "NEXUS" is a common word, so it may be considered "descriptive" or "generic" in some industries. You may want to combine it with another term to make it more distinctive (e.g., "NEXUS Hyperledger").

### 5. **Check Domain Availability**

- Check if relevant domains (like [http://nexus.com](http://nexus.com) or nexus.tech) are available or already in use by another company. Secure domains like "[nexus-aifaq.com](http://nexus-aifaq.com)" or something similar that ties to your brand.

### 6. **File a Trademark Application**

- **Prepare the application**: Once you’ve confirmed availability and chosen your classification, you can prepare to file.
  
  - You’ll need to describe how the NEXUS mark will be used (e.g., in connection with a blockchain product).
  - Submit a specimen showing how the mark is used in commerce.
- **File with USPTO**: If you're in the U.S., you’ll file through the USPTO. If you're operating globally, consider filing through WIPO’s Madrid System to cover multiple jurisdictions.
- **Fees**: Be aware that filing a trademark comes with associated fees, which vary by country and filing complexity.

### 7. **Monitor for Oppositions**

- After filing, there will be a 30-day window where others can oppose your trademark application. You’ll need to monitor this and respond if there’s opposition.

### 8. **Maintain the Trademark**

- After securing the trademark, you’ll need to actively use the mark in commerce and file regular maintenance documents to keep the registration alive.
