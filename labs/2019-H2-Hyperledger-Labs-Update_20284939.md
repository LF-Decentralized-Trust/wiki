# Hyperledger Labs : 2019 H2 Hyperledger Labs Update

Created by Ry Jones, last modified by Arnaud J LE HORS on Dec 18, 2019

Total Labs: **24 (20 active, 4 archived)**

# Overall Health

We have attracted many new contributions, most of the existing labs have continued activity.

Contributions to the labs continue to flow in not only from people associated with the larger projects, but also from newer participants.

Some labs are suffering from a lack of attention. Several labs have not had any commits this year, and are in the process of being archived.

We are also exploring the different metrics around commit frequency to surface the community health of the labs in general and individual labs in particular. We are open to suggestions on how to improve the labs on-boarding, especially from contributors who have gone through the acceptance process.

**Labs that contributed to full-time projects**

  Lab NameDescription[crypto-lib](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/crypto-lib "https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/crypto-lib")A lab for experimentation on creating shared cryptography modules for cross-project collaboration. Added to Ursa[z-mix](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/z-mix "https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/z-mix")z-mix will offer a generic way to create Zero-Knowledge proofs, proving statements about multiple cryptographic building blocks, containing signatures, commitments, and verifiable encryption. z-mix facilitates. Added to Ursa[trusted-compute-framework](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/trusted-compute-framework)The Trusted Compute Framework (TCF) enables privacy in blockchain transactions, moving intensive processing from a main blockchain to improve scalability and latency, and to support attested Oracles. Avalon is a continuation of this.
