NVIDIA AI

Hosted by Dell and NVIDIA, this hackathon invites developers and data scientists to build groundbreaking Generative AI projects using [NVIDIA AI Workbench](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/deep-learning-ai/solutions/data-science/workbench/). AI Workbench is an all-in-one solution for developing, customizing, and using GPU enabled workflows and applications. 

[NVIDIA AI Workbench](https://docs.nvidia.com/ai-workbench/user-guide/latest/overview/introduction.html) is a free, user-friendly development environment manager that streamlines data science, ML and AI projects on systems of choice – PC, workstation, datacenter, or cloud. Users can develop, test, and prototype projects locally on Windows, macOS and Ubuntu and easily transfer development environments and computational work between systems (local and remote) to optimize cost, availability, and scale. 

Build something cool in AI Workbench and then share it on GitHub. Demonstrate how AI Workbench can be used to build and deliver applications for a wide range of tasks and workflows. Provide a user-friendly solution for anything from data science to generative AI applications. Check out some of our existing projects on [NVIDIA’s GitHub](https://github.com/NVIDIA?q=workbench&type=all&language=&sort=). Even better, AI Workbench will let other people run it on their own systems, from local machines like laptops and workstations, to remote systems like servers, cloud instances, and VMs.

For an added twist, tackle one of our Bonus Categories and vie for a special prize! Dive into Enterprise Generative AI to streamline workflows and automate complex processes, explore Enterprise Data Analysis to enhance decision-making and security, or venture into Enterprise Computer Vision to transform industries from agriculture to retail. Get inspired, get coding, and show us how far your creativity can take you!

Check out the [NVIDIA Developer Program](https://developer.nvidia.com/developer-program) to get free access to the latest NVIDIA tools, SDKs, and NIM microservices that can be used with AI Workbench.
