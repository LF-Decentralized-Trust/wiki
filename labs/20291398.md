### Vision:

Vision: the pick of the mountain 

### **Our vision: "Democratize AI for your enterprise"**

### Mission

Missions: steps to reach

**Mission: Use open-source AI LLM to create a Chatbot which support users/developers job**

Traditional elevator pitch: Who needs it? What do they get (that they can only get from you) and what’s the transformation they get as a result.  
One way to think of the elevator pitch is: Who needs it, what do they get and how do you transform their life.

**Arcui Usoara meeting notes:**

How to evaluate the timing? Often, I think we are late because companies have a product, or sometimes I think it's too early for skeptical companies.  
Define the right country/market, and define the right problem to solve (also in the future)  
For a market some technologies can be late for other countries can be too early.

What about the costs? Our prototype costs 300+ dollars for cloud  
define the market for that costs: for some companies 300 dollars are not too much.  
Important: that is only the cloud cost but we have to add revenue!!

General suggestions about to create a good or the best MVP? how to find the product market fit?  
**1. define 75 users**

2\. meet them with online interviews

3\. ask questions as an interview:

### Steps

Create blog

eBook - how to implement and test

Consulting

### **Lean Canvas for Hyperledger AIFAQ Project**

#### 1. **Problem**

- **Complexity in understanding blockchain technologies:** Most new users and developers find it challenging to comprehend the technical jargon and concepts associated with blockchain and Hyperledger.
- **Lack of centralized, accurate, and reliable information:** Information related to Hyperledger projects is often scattered and inconsistent across various forums and documents.
- **Time-consuming support process:** Developers and users spend significant time searching for answers to common issues, which slows down development and adoption of Hyperledger tools.

#### 2. **Customer Segments**

- **Developers** working on or learning Hyperledger projects.
- **Project managers** and **business leaders** involved in blockchain solutions.
- **Blockchain educators** and **students** looking for reliable knowledge sources.
- **Enterprises** and **startups** using or planning to integrate Hyperledger into their systems.

#### 3. **Unique Value Proposition**

- **AI-powered automated FAQ system**: AIFAQ provides an easy-to-use, conversational AI system that offers immediate answers to common Hyperledger questions, drastically reducing research time and learning curves.
- **Dynamic and continuously updated knowledge base**: The system learns from user queries, ensuring the information remains current, relevant, and tailored to real-world needs.
- **Open-source and community-driven**: As part of the Hyperledger ecosystem, AIFAQ benefits from the contributions and support of the global blockchain community.

#### 4. **Solution**

- **AI-driven chatbot** that integrates with various Hyperledger platforms to provide instant support for users' queries.
- **Natural language processing (NLP)** models trained specifically on blockchain and Hyperledger terminology to ensure accurate and relevant answers.
- **Self-service portal** where users can access frequently asked questions, tutorials, and documentation curated by both AI and the community.
- **Continuous improvement** through user feedback and active learning by the AI to update the knowledge base.

#### 5. **Channels**

- **Direct integration with Hyperledger tools and platforms** (such as Hyperledger Fabric, Indy, and Sawtooth).
- **Web-based chatbot interface** available on the Hyperledger website.
- **Community platforms** like Hyperledger forums, GitHub, and open-source repositories.
- **Educational institutions and blockchain courses** incorporating AIFAQ for student support.
- **Social media and blockchain forums** to promote awareness and gather user feedback.

#### 6. **Revenue Streams**

- **Open-source model with sponsorships**: As an open-source project, revenue could come from sponsorships by enterprises benefiting from the tool.
- **Premium features for businesses**: Advanced AI capabilities or priority support could be offered as premium services to large enterprises using Hyperledger technologies.
- **Partnerships with educational platforms** that pay for tailored AI support for blockchain education.
- **Consulting services**: Provide consultation and integration services for businesses that need customized implementations of AIFAQ.

#### 7. **Cost Structure**

- **Development and maintenance costs**: Regular updates to AI models, NLP training, and platform integration.
- **Server hosting and infrastructure**: Costs for hosting the chatbot and knowledge base system.
- **Marketing and community engagement**: Efforts to promote the project within the blockchain community and wider tech industry.
- **Customer support and feedback**: Managing user feedback loops and providing real-time support when necessary.

#### 8. **Key Metrics**

- **Number of users and queries handled per day**.
- **Response accuracy and satisfaction rate** (measured by user feedback after queries).
- **Community engagement**: Contributions from users, feedback, and issue resolutions through forums.
- **Adoption rate** of Hyperledger technologies post-interaction with AIFAQ.
- **Time saved** by users compared to traditional support or research methods.

#### 9. **Unfair Advantage**

- **Hyperledger brand and ecosystem support**: Being closely tied to Hyperledger offers credibility and a strong initial user base.
- **Specialized AI model**: The AI is trained specifically for blockchain and Hyperledger, making it more accurate than general-purpose solutions.
- **Community-driven innovation**: AIFAQ’s continuous improvement model allows it to evolve rapidly, keeping pace with user needs and technology changes.
