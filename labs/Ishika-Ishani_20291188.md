**My Ideas for Project :**

Since we need to wrap up the ML model into an API, we need to host it on a server and make use of FastAPI to get the actual api and integrate it with the frontend part. While testing the model, I saw "use via api" option in Gradio, I tried integrating the api with a React application.but faced "React UnhandledSchemeError - "node:buffer" is not handled by plugins" error though i am trying to find a solution to that, but if we used the default way of implementation, I would use django for the backend with fast api along with react frontend.

For the frontend I will :

1. Create a new React application , Install necessary packages like **`axios`, `react-google-login`, and `react-router-dom`** and implement Google authentication using `react-google-login.`

      2. Develop a `Login` component for user authentication , create a `Chat` component to handle user input and display responses.

      3. Use **`useState`** and **`useContext`** for managing user authentication state ,use **`axios`** to make API calls to the FastAPI backend whenever a user sends a message.

      4. Implement routing using **`react-router-dom`** to navigate between login and chat components.

      5. Design a user-friendly interface with a side panel for past conversations and an input area for new messages.

For the backend I will :

1. Create a new Django project and app for user authentication. Install Django, Django REST Framework, and other necessary packages.

      2. Set up **`django-allauth`** and configure Google OAuth2 authentication. Define models for user profiles and any other necessary data structures.

      3. Develop views and serializers for user authentication and profile management. Create REST API endpoints for login, signup, and token management.

      4. Run migrations to set up the database schema.

For FastAPI Development I will :

      1. Create a new FastAPI application , install FastAPI, Uvicorn, and any other necessary packages.

      2. Define Pydantic models for request and response schemas. and load and integrate the machine learning model for inference within the FastAPI application.

     3. Create API endpoints to handle chatbot queries

     4. Configure CORS to allow frontend requests and use Uvicorn to run the FastAPI server locally for development and testing.
