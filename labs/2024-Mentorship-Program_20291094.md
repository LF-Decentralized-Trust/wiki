## Discussion:

1. LF 's new "foundation" might be a better fit for us:

I wanted to share news about plans to form Linux Foundation Decentralized Trust -- this will be a home for the open development of a broad range of ledger, identity, security, interoperability, scale, implementation, and related technologies.

This will encompass the growing portfolio of Hyperledger projects and host new open source software, communities, standards, and specifications that are critical to the macro shift toward decentralized systems of distributed trust.

All Hyperledger projects and labs will continue to be supported by Linux Foundation staff and we will continue to offer the same services and tools to the people working on those projects and labs.  There will be some changes to the names and URLs of some of our tools and we will communicate more about that so you have the details.

Since this news is relevant for people involved with Hyperledger projects, I wanted to make sure to share this on the channels for Hyperledger's projects. If you have any questions about this, let us know and Hyperledger staff members will be happy to join one of your project calls to discuss this and answer questions.

More details about the plans for Linux Foundation Decentralized Trust is at: [https://share.hsforms.com/1-Er-mwdeT6yGZKtIPu8NJQ4tvhy](https://share.hsforms.com/1-Er-mwdeT6yGZKtIPu8NJQ4tvhy) (Will send over this week)
