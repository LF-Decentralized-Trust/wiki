# Hyperledger Labs : Minifab

Created by Ry Jones, last modified on Jun 08, 2022

**Minifabric** is the tool to get you started with Hyperledger Fabric fast, easy and right. No matter you just want to get a feel about Fabric or you need to develop your Fabric applications, Minifabric is ready to help. It does not ask you to do a long list of things before you run your first minifab command, all you need is a docker environment regardless it is a production server or is a VirtualBox vm, you can setup your first network in few minutes. To the very experienced Hyperledger Fabric users, if you eager to deploy Fabric onto K8S cluster, yes, you can use Minifabric exactly same way as you use Minifabric locally to stand up your Fabric network and work with your chaincode.

#### Feature Highlight

Minifabric is small but it allows you to experience the full capabilities of Hyperledger Fabric.

- Fabric network setup and expansion such as adding new organizations
- channel query, create, join, channel update
- chaincode install, approve, instantiation, invoke, query and private data collection
- ledger height and block query and Hyperledger Explorer support
- node monitoring, health check and discovery
- never pollute your environment, Minifabric is just one small script + a docker container image
