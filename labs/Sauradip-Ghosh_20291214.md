# **ABOUT ME**

I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science at MAKAUT University in India. During my studies, I have gained experience in various programming languages, including Python and C++, which I learned in my first year of college. I then specialized in backend programming and became proficient in frameworks such as Node.js and Express.js. Additionally, I have a good understanding of front-end programming using JavaScript libraries such as React and Next.

In addition to my programming skills, I am also familiar with unit testing JavaScript code using Jest, React Testing Library, and Cypress. I am passionate about learning new technologies and have a particular interest in Full-stack Development and low-level system concepts.

Furthermore, I am currently exploring Ollama (llama2) and LangChain, aiming to broaden my knowledge and stay updated with the latest advancements in the field.

# **STATEMENT OF MOTIVATION**

I chose the Hyperledger Project because I liked the overall idea of a chatbot using existing large language models (LLMs) for parsing user-provided text into accurate queries found on the internet. Chatbot should be capable of receiving and understanding user prompts in natural language, initiating the corresponding API calls using predefined Hyperledger parameters with my Stack i.e, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, and LLM(Ollama, LangChain). I also have a bit of understanding in LLM-core and this project will help me improve my skills on the stack listed above.

I have a deep appreciation for the Hyperledger community and its mentors. After being in the community for a while, I had an exceptional experience with the Hyperledger mentors, who not only provided me with valuable assistance but also served as my mentors whenever I faced challenges. Being a part of the Hyperledger community has been incredibly fulfilling, and I would relish the opportunity to continue to contribute and help in growing it.
