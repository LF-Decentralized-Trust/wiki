**Project Name: Hyperledger Labs AI-FAQ LLM ChatBot GUI implementation and prototype deployment**

**Primary Focus: Coding and Documentation**

Greetings to everyone,I am Anshika Vashistha ,a prefinal year graduate in Information Technology, at Galgotia College of Engineering and Technology.

Here is my personal portfolio website: [https://anshikavashistha.netlify.app/](https://anshikavashistha.netlify.app/)

**Project Synopsis:**

This project focuses on enhancing the usability and accessibility of the existing Hyperledger Labs AIFAQ, a proof-of-concept Large Language Model (LLM) chatbot. Currently, AIFAQ utilizes a Google Colab Notebook with a Gradio interface, limiting its user-friendliness and scalability.

### **Business Committee**

In social media ,I have been working on the Medium and Github project maintainer. Here is the medium article:

### Development Committee

1. [Fixing prompt bugs](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/aifaq/issues/33): While performing the API testing ,I have encountered an Internal server error caused due to prompt bugs.
2. [Revamping UI component](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/aifaq/issues/21): Here is the draft of the PR link,[https://github.com/swaptr/aifaq/pull/1/files#diff-9eaa8c31e85b60ae25c139f2d6363cc9dcb6926125b5bf1d0cac092547e8cfcb](https://github.com/swaptr/aifaq/pull/1/files#diff-9eaa8c31e85b60ae25c139f2d6363cc9dcb6926125b5bf1d0cac092547e8cfcb) 
   
   The following UI components need to be revamped. Note that we are using `shadcn/ui` and `radix` for the base components so we can support any first-class dependencies from there.
   
   - Responsive Navigation Bar
   - Dropdown Menu
   - Responsive Modals
