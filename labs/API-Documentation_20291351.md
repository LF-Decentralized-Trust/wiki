# Hyperledger Labs : API Documentation

Created by Gianluca Capuzzi, last modified by Jacqueline Zhang on Jul 08, 2024

This documentation contains information on how to setup the API.

# Optional:

- Set up the Cloud IDE (e.g. [https://lightning.ai/studios](https://lightning.ai/studios))
- Create a new Project (named Studio)

# API Setup

## Paste the API Code

The command is

```
git clone https://github.com/gcapuzzi/aifaq_api1
```

## Obtain ReadTheDocs Documentation

Download the ReadTheDocs documentation in "rtdocs" folder via the following command

```
wget -r -A.html -P rtdocs https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.5/
```

Once it starts to download the previous versions, we can interrupt the code (CTRL + C)

Then, move into rtdocs folder and move the release-2.5 content to rtdocs. To do so, first compress the content of the folder, moving there via command:

```
tar -czvf rtdocs.tar.gz .


```

After, move the readthedocs.tar.gz to the parent directory (../) by repeating the following 2 commands until we are into rtdocs folder:

- ```
  mv readthedocs.tar.gz ..
  ```
- ```
  cd ..
  ```

Then, enter the following command in the terminal:

```
rm -rf hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io

```

Finally, uncompress the file here and remove compress file:

- ```
  tar -xzvf rtdocs.tar.gz
  ```
- ```
  rm rtdocs.tar.gz
  ```

## Create VectorDB

First, install all the required libraries/packages via

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

\* ensure that you are in the parent directory

Then, run ingest.py

## Launch API

Run api.py to launch the API service

Test the API via commands like this

```
curl --header "Content-Type: application/json" --request POST --data '{"text": "How to install Hyperledger fabric?"}' http://127.0.0.1/query
```
