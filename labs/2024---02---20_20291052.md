# Hyperledger Labs : 2024 - 02 - 20

Created by fayyaadh adams, last modified on Feb 26, 2024

**Attendance:** 13 Members

**Agenda:**

- Introductions
- Updates
- Architecture Decision Records
- Project Roadmap
- HyperLedger OEA Repository Incident
- Changes to the PRISM DID Specification (Bjorn)
- Open Issues
- Q&amp;A

**Notes:**

Over the weekend (Feb12) there was a security breach that aimed to execute commands on our self hosted runners. The execution was prevented and repository security was updated. 

When you see a DID, we do not know what Network it is on. We do need to maybe consider introducing a fullnetwork/subnetwork path

ACTION: To put a feature request in  to consider the above

OPEN ISSUES:

1. 1. Update PR template
      
      1. File can be added to repo to reflect updated PR template
   2. DIDComm service URL over htpps
      
      1. This will be reviewed and a change to code (startup script) will be updated and documentation will be updated on how to run the service
   3. Remove the “report a vulnerability”
      
      1. Dave will have a look at the policy and update it. Security vulnerability should not be visible as people can take advantage of it
   4. Connection state not updated
      
      1. This has been fixed by updated the updation so it can be closed
   5. Missing MAINTAINERS.MD
      
      1. File has been updated
   6. Agent generating invalid URL for DIDComm endpoint
      
      1. This will be looked at and feedback provided accordingly
   7. Memory leak
      
      1. Bjorn and Dave to test together next week

**Questions:**

1. Can we provide support for with the DIDPrism method for multiple blockchains?
2. When you see a DID, we do not know what Network it is on. Can we add a prefix to those DID's to identify which network they are on?
