# Hyperledger Labs : Driving growth of Hyperledger Labs

Created by Ry Jones, last modified on Jan 27, 2020

Recruiting projects to join labs

- Apache has more labs
  
  - [List here](https://labs.apache.org/labs.html) of 40 labs
  - Should we consider adopting [some of these](https://labs.apache.org/bylaws.html) practices? In particular, the lifecycle:
    
    - A lab can have four states:
      
      - Active
      - Idle
      - Promoted
      - Completed
- Perhaps [Apache Podlings](https://incubator.apache.org) are a better fit?
  
  - [This page on status](https://incubator.apache.org/clutch/) may be something to emulate
- For example: [https://github.com/sivachokkapu/revive-cc](https://github.com/sivachokkapu/revive-cc)
  
  - GitHub user is not a member of Labs or Hyperledger
  - Needs relicensed

Recruiting people to become stewards

- Are stewards a bottleneck?
- Does Labs need more?
