# Hyperledger Labs : 2018 Q4 Hyperledger Labs Update

Created by Tracy Kuhrt, last modified on Jan 03, 2019

Total Labs: **13**

# Overall Health

The labs are doing well.

We have attracted many new contributions, many of the existing labs see a lot of continued activity. Two contributions have left the labs and have been welcomed as as a single project under incubation in Hyperledger, in the form of Hyperledger Ursa.

Contributions to the labs continue to flow in not only from people associated with the larger projects, but also from newer participants.

We have had some discussions about formalizing the role of the lab sponsor and came up with consensus around language to be added to the charter. There is an ongoing debate around the eligibility of LF staff to sponsor projects.

We are also exploring the different metrics around commits and their frequency to surface the community health of the labs in general and individual labs in particular. We are open to suggestions on how to improve the labs on-boarding, especially from contributors who have gone through the acceptance process.
