**Machine Learning and Deep Learning Explained**

Machine Learning is a field of study that aims to build machines "learning" from data. 

In 1957, the scientist Frank Rosenblatt published (*The Perceptron: A Perceiving and Recognizing Automaton, Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory*) the first concept of perceptron, which is the learning algorithm based on **human neuron** behavior.

Rosenblatt's **Perceptron** study was based on the results of two other scientists (*Pitts W. and McCulloch W., 1943*).

Below, an image that depicts the human neuron:

The McCulloch-Pitts neuron works like a logic gate, where:

- The dendrites are the inputs
- The axon is the output that can be linked to other neurons
- The nucleus of the cell receives all the inputs

Furthermore, if the accumulated signal, in the nucleus, exceeds a **threshold** an output signal is generated and that will be passed on by the axon.

A logic schema below:

Where:

- x1, x2 … xn are the input values
- w1, w2 … wn  are the weights on each inputs
- sum = x1 * w1 + x2 * w2 + … + xn * wn
- if sum &gt; threshold output is 1 (or true) else it is 0 or (false)
