Created by fayyaadh adams, last modified on Dec 12, 2023

**Attendance:** 10 members

**Agenda:**

- Introduction &amp; welcome to new members
- Community Update
- Security practices
- Communicating the roadmap
- Q&amp;A

**Notes:**

- Community Update
  
  - We will formally announce our contribution to Hyperledger on the 28th of November
  - Our meetup will be on the 5th of December 2023 at 7am Pacific time
- Security practices
  
  - We need to ensure proper checks and balances around the CI pipeline
  - Ensure we can accept contributions with a low barrier to entry
  - Ensure our automation tools are protected from abuse (run the pipeline only when a maintainer comments/or reviewed, limit what the pipeline can do)
  - Have a process and take advantage of the tools we already have linked in - for example static code analysis for code quality
  - Have a template for TARA or at time of feature definition (Does this feature touch crypto or allow arbitrary code to be run)
  - Maintainers as a point of contact to be security aware
  - Think through publications of security issues from external audit - external code review findings for example (responsible disclosure)
  - Ensure we have a security policy with contact details in the repo
  - Be part of and publish findings on the security of the protocols we implement and support
  - It should be hard to build insecure solutions that create harm for the people using or subjected to them
  - ACTION: we will draft a security policy. We will also update the contribution guidelines to include a security checklist
- Communicating the roadmap
  
  - The open enterprise agent will be part of a wider set of components
  - We briefly touched on where we should communicate the roadmap
  - We also touched on what should be included in the roadmap going forward
