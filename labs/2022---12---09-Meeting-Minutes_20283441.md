## **Open Items:**

1. Community to come up with the common time for recurring meetings.

3. The recurring meetings will have the time divided for multiple tasks. For example, the first 20 minutes will be for reviewing the code or going through a demo since the previous meeting, the following 20 minutes will be for reviewing the backlog and groomingÂ list of issues to be picked up, the final 20 minutes will be for feature in-take, bug report discussions and open for community to discuss any enhancements.

## **Features for Hyperledger Labs - Blockchain Explorer**

1. Configurations for purging old data from the Explorer database. Keep only recent data, provide a query back mechanism to read back from the blockchain for any of the purged data.
2. It would be great to have a view to indicate which peers are offline, not reachable.
3. Currently it is not possible to have a view to know missing business records within individual chaincode level.
4. Feature to eliminate the need for admin credential privileges, the explorer shall only consume read based key for its operations.
5. It will be nice to have explorer help in visualizing code from the chaincode.
