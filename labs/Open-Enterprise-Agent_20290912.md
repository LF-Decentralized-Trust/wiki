# Hyperledger Labs : Open Enterprise Agent

Created by fayyaadh adams, last modified on Nov 22, 2023

# What is the Open Enterprise Agent?

The Open Enterprise Agent is a software agent for **building decentralised identity applications and services in line with W3C standards and Hyperledger Aries RFCs**. Aiming to be blockchain agnostic , it provides a scalable, robust, performant and user-friendly platform for building solutions and products based on it. Its REST API enables easy integration with any programming language, on top of a core built in Scala, a language well suited for building fault-tolerant, highly concurrent systems.

**Born out of Atala PRISM agent**, with Atala engineers being primary contributors to the source code at its origin.
