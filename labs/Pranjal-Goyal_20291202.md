# Hyperledger Labs : Pranjal Goyal

Created by Pranjal Goyal, last modified on May 24, 2024

Hello, I'm Pranjal Goyal, hailing from the capital city of Delhi. Currently, I am in my final year, pursuing a bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from NIT, Hamirpur. My journey into web development began during my early college days. I believe the most effective way to learn a skill is through practical application, so I actively participated in hackathons, collaborating in teams to develop numerous projects. These experiences greatly enhanced my skills. Concurrently, I engaged in various coding communities within my college. In my second year, I was tasked with creating a full-stack web app for our technical fest, Nimbus. This experience solidified my passion for the field.

Moreover, I hold certification as a Meta Developer and was honoured with the title of API Campus Expert by Postman for my proficiency in crafting clean REST APIs using their platform for testing. Professionally, I have accumulated 1.5 years of experience working with diverse technologies, ranging from Git, HTML, CSS, ReactJS, TypeScript, NodeJs, ExpressJS, Azure, Docker etc. I have also contributed to fast-paced startups, where I played a pivotal role in developing an MVP within six months and presenting its unique features to potential investors.

## My Understanding of the project so far

I have already worked on this part and made a prototype from the understanding of the Project.Ihavedevelopeda user-friendlyinterfaceusingTailwindCSSfortheChatBot using ReactJs. This UI can be used to implement the interface as a functional prototype that can later be integrated with the backend LLM of user choice.

Containerization with Docker offers a convenient way to package your application along with its dependencies into a lightweight, portable container. This approach ensures consistency across different environments and simplifies deployment, making it an ideal choice for our React frontend and FastAPI backend application. I'll start by creating Dockerfiles for each component, specifying base images with Node.js for the frontend and Python for the backend. These files will include instructions to copy the application code, install dependencies, and expose the necessary ports. Next, I'll define a Docker Compose file to orchestrate the services, configuring dependencies, volume mounts for code synchronisation, and runtime configurations. With Docker, I can build and run containers effortlessly using docker build and docker-compose up, ensuring our application performs reliably and consistently in any environment. Containerization provides benefits such as portability, isolation, and scalability, empowering us to deploy our React + FastAPI application with confidence and efficiency.

## Participation

I will be online on slack and Discord between 9 AM to 8 PM (IST). I will make sure to pass all the evaluations perfectly. I have NO other obligations and will work full time on the proposed project throughout the LFX mentorship phase. I will be available for around 40 hours per week but I can work more to meet the deadlines if required. 

I am genuinely excited about the opportunity to participate in the Mentorship with Hyperledger Foundation for several reasons. Firstly, the project itself aligns perfectly with my interests and aspirations as a software engineer. I have always been drawn to projects that involve web development and AI, and the project described aligns with both of these areas.

Moreover, the association with Hyperledger Foundation is a significant factor for me. Hyperledger has established itself as a renowned organisation in the blockchain space, and the opportunity to learn and contribute to a project under their mentorship is invaluable. I believe that participating in this mentorship will not only enhance my skills as a software engineer but also expose me to the best practices and advancements in the open source AI domain.
