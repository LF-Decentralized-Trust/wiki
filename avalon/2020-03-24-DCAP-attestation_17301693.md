# Hyperledger Avalon (EOL) : 2020-03-24 DCAP attestation

Created by mysore.subbakrishna.sriharsha, last modified by Dan Anderson on Mar 25, 2020

## Date

24 Mar 2020

**Goals**  
To look in to how to use the datacenter attestation primitives

**Discussion items**  
A presentation on DCAP attestation primitives for Intel SGX TEEs with Avalon (Proxy Model) by Mr. Dan Middleton from Intel, covering the following topics

- Basics of attestation
- Use the lab to demonstrate creating an attestation at one CSP
- and then verifying it in a (virtual) on-prem datacenter

The attestation flow enables more distributed communication patterns than what we have today.

The added flexibility also means there are a lot of possible paths to choose which can seem confusing.

In order to get started, here's a lab that chooses one concrete path.
