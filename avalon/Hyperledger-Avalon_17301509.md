**Description**Hyperledger Avalon enables privacy in blockchain transactions, moving intensive processing from a main blockchain to improve scalability and latency, and to support attested Oracles

This project is currently in `end of life` state. Depending on your needs, please refer to one of the following projects instead:

- for core programming in enclave based confidential computation, [Confidential Computing Consortium](https://confidentialcomputing.io/)
- for using Zero Knowledge Proofs in privacy preserving blockchain transactions, [Hyperledger Ursa](https://github.com/hyperledger/ursa)
- for achieving privacy using offchain data channels with blockchain coordination, [Hyperledger FireFly](https://github.com/hyperledger/firefly)
- for similar functionality, see [Private Data Objects](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/private-data-objects), a Hyperledger Lab

# Key Characteristics

- Hyperledger Avalon leverages the existence of a distributed ledger to:
  
  - Maintain a registry of the trusted workers (including their attestation info)
  - Provide a mechanism for submitting work orders from a client(s) to a worker
  - Preserve a log of work order receipts and acknowledgments
- Hyperledger Avalon uses the  [*Off-Chain Trusted Compute Specification*](https://entethalliance.github.io/trusted-computing/spec.html)  defined by Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA) Task Force as a starting point to apply a consistent and compatible approach to all supported blockchains

# History

- 2018-06-26 Incubation status initiated for *Hyperledger Trusted Compute Framework* with approval of the Hyperledger Technical Steering Committee and creation of a Hyperledger Labs repository
- 2018-10-03 [Renamed Hyperledger Avalon and entered full-fledged active status](https://www.hyperledger.org/blog/2019/10/03/introducing-hyperledger-avalon)

## Complete these tasks to get started

- Configure the sidebar - remove the "Pages", "Blog", and "Space Shortcuts" sections by clicking on the \`-\` sign next to them until they appear as a \`+\` sign. Then save the changes.
- Create a Meeting Agendas and Notes page - Click the Create button in the header to get started
- Brand your Space - Click Configure Sidebar in the left panel to update space details and logo
- Set permissions - Click Space Tools in the left sidebar to update permissions and give others access (usually the only change here is to click the View option for Anonymous users)
- Label the page appropriately - For a project space, label this page `project-home`. For a workgroup space, label this `wg-home`. For a SIG space, label this `SIG-home`.
