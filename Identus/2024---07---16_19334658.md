# Hyperledger Identus : 2024 - 07 - 16

Created by fayyaadh adams on Jul 17, 2024

### Remember the [Hyperledger Code of Conduct](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/HYP/Hyperledger+Code+of+Conduct)

### Anti-Trust Policy:

Linux Foundation meetings involve participation by industry competitors, and it is the intention of the Linux Foundation to conduct all of its activities in accordance with applicable antitrust and competition laws. It is therefore extremely important that attendees adhere to meeting agendas, and be aware of, and not participate in any activities that are prohibited under applicable US state, federal or foreign antitrust and competition laws.

Examples of types of actions that are prohibited at Linux Foundation meetings and in connection with Linux Foundation activities are described in the Linux Foundation Antitrust Policy available at [http://www.linuxfoundation.org/antitrust-policy](http://www.linuxfoundation.org/antitrust-policy). If you have questions about these matters, please contact your company counsel, or if you are a member of the Linux Foundation, feel free to contact Andrew Updegrove of the firm of Gesmer Updegrove LLP, which provides legal counsel to the Linux Foundation.

### Attendees:

24 attendees joined the meeting

### Agenda:

1. Introductions
2. Community Updates
3. Community Spotlight - Sean Kelly
4. Working Groups
5. Q&amp;A - Ask us anything

#### COMMUNITY UPDATES:

1. Repositories are moving to Hyperledger. Please remember to log any issues that you may experience so we can keep track of them and address them accordingly
2. We will be making use of Insights for Identus. This will allow us to measure metrics accurately and monitor the health of the project.
3. Working Groups
   
   1. **WHAT?**
      
      1. What does it mean to integrate SSI in DApps?
      2. Explore how Identus can be leveraged within decentralized applications
      3. The goal is to create a reference model for incorporating SSI capabilities in DApps
   2. **HOW?**
      
      1. Use Design Science Research (DSR) approach
      2. Asynchronous (Discord) [https://discord.com/channels/1146426895114702858/1261314721861075014](https://discord.com/channels/1146426895114702858/1261314721861075014)
      3. Target Cardano and Midnight Dapps
      4. Will be an agenda item of the maintainer/outreach calls
      5. If it grows we can spin a proper WG
   3. **Identus + DApps (Design Science Research Approach)**
      
      1. The Design Science Research (DSR) approach is a systematic method used to solve complex problems by creating and evaluating artifacts. In our case, the DSR approach will be structured into three phases.
         
         - Problem Definition Phase
           
           - focuses on understanding and defining the problem. It involves a literature review, real-world observations, and feedback from practitioners to identify gaps, challenges, and opportunities. The goal is to clearly articulate the problem and justify the value of solving it.
         - Artifact Creation Phase
           
           - an innovative solution is developed. This involves proposing a tentative design, defining clear objectives, and creating the artifact through iterative development. Feedback is crucial to refine the solution.
         - Artifact Evaluation Phase
           
           - The final phase assesses the performance and effectiveness of the created artifact. The solution is demonstrated in a real-world or simulated environment, and its impact is evaluated using quantitative and qualitative methods. The findings are analyzed, implications discussed, and areas for future research identified.
