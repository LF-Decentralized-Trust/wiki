**QUESTIONS AND NOTES:**

1. We would like to propose that community members should fork the main branch on issues they encounter so that we can have engineers validate the test case and see the issues to help improve collaboration and speed up end to end tests . **The proposer will create PR on this suggestion and merge in contributing file**
2. Identus platform - we need to collect more information from community members around what features are needed for the platform - A survey will be sent out and community members will be encouraged to respond
