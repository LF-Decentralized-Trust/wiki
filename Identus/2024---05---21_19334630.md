Created by fayyaadh adams on May 23, 2024

### Remember the [Hyperledger Code of Conduct](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/HYP/Hyperledger+Code+of+Conduct)

### Anti-Trust Policy:

Linux Foundation meetings involve participation by industry competitors, and it is the intention of the Linux Foundation to conduct all of its activities in accordance with applicable antitrust and competition laws. It is therefore extremely important that attendees adhere to meeting agendas, and be aware of, and not participate in any activities that are prohibited under applicable US state, federal or foreign antitrust and competition laws.

Examples of types of actions that are prohibited at Linux Foundation meetings and in connection with Linux Foundation activities are described in the Linux Foundation Antitrust Policy available at [http://www.linuxfoundation.org/antitrust-policy](http://www.linuxfoundation.org/antitrust-policy). If you have questions about these matters, please contact your company counsel, or if you are a member of the Linux Foundation, feel free to contact Andrew Updegrove of the firm of Gesmer Updegrove LLP, which provides legal counsel to the Linux Foundation.

### Attendees:

20 attendees joined the meeting

### Agenda:

1. Introductions
2. Community Updates
3. Community Spotlight - *Bjorn Sandmann - Analytics Platform*
4. Q&amp;A - Ask us anything

#### COMMUNITY UPDATES:

- We plan on conducting all future related technical topics on the Hyperledger Discord. Join using this link: [https://discord.gg/hyperledger](https://discord.gg/hyperledger)
- We officially have a new logo! Thank you to the community for voting on a logo design
- We plan on creating a technical charter template. A technical charter defines the project operations and the IP policy.  We were provided a proposed technical oversight for the project that falls to a “Technical Steering Committee” made up of the project’s committers. At a later date the TSC is free to evolve how membership on the TSC is determined to accommodate project growth and the evolution of its governance.
