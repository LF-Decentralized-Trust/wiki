      1. This issue will be updated by the team and a standard contributing guideline will be applied

**QUESTIONS AND NOTES:**

1. basically how can 2 peers exchange information unrelated to VCs via their Did? No API in Identus for that, but surely it should be possible. The idea behind is that peers do not only exchange comms for VCs, but possibly other side-stuff
   
   1. There are several protocols within DIDComm. The basic messaging protocol can be used in this particular use case - [https://github.com/hyperledger/identus-edge-agent-sdk-ts/blob/da27890ad4ff3d32576bda8bc99a1185e7239a4c/demos/node-esm/src/index.js#L66](https://github.com/hyperledger/identus-edge-agent-sdk-ts/blob/da27890ad4ff3d32576bda8bc99a1185e7239a4c/demos/node-esm/src/index.js#L66)
