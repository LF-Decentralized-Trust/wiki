# Besu : Usage of vulnerability scanners

Created by Sally MacFarlane, last modified on May 08, 2022

Options for vulnerability scanning for Besu. There are tools. Lots of tools. 

# Dependabot

- Dependabot is enabled. No current alerts, open or closed:

[https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/security/dependabot](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/security/dependabot)

# LGTM

running on PRs

# CodeQL analysis

- Added here [https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/3774](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/3774)

Running on main

# Trivy

Teku uses Trivy, and scans the develop docker images. So scan results only include runtime dependencies not build or test dependencies. See [https://github.com/ConsenSys/teku/blob/master/.circleci/config.yml](https://github.com/ConsenSys/teku/blob/master/.circleci/config.yml)

- Nightly scan of docker image for Besu - sample report [https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/hyperledger/besu/12961/workflows/dde97a21-0eb3-4345-8767-0d4490a2ee44/jobs/71864](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/hyperledger/besu/12961/workflows/dde97a21-0eb3-4345-8767-0d4490a2ee44/jobs/71864)

# NexusIQ

It is from sonatype [https://blog.sonatype.com/nexus-vulnerability-scanner-and-vulnerability-analysis](https://blog.sonatype.com/nexus-vulnerability-scanner-and-vulnerability-analysis) but I couldn’t even try it out without agreeing to a whole bunch of stuff on behalf of company so did not proceed.

Has a number of "levels" 1-10. According to the user’s report, there were a number of “level 7” and “level 10” vulnerabilities (details in the [ticket](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/issues/3229)). (These were fixed in 21.10.7)

# Snyk

Integrates quite nicely with github but there is a lot of noise. 

- [Also integrates with DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/hyperledger/besu) but only admins can see the report

# Dependency check gradle plugin

Useful but we don't want to gate PRs on this.

There is also a homebrew option

# Maven central

Maven central does an ok job of pointing out *some* CVEs [https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.hyperledger.besu.internal/eth/21.10.6](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.hyperledger.besu.internal/eth/21.10.6) 

Disadvantage is it’s only available once the artefact is published, by which time it's a bit late. SNAPSHOT versions don’t get imported into [mvnrepository.com](http://mvnrepository.com)
