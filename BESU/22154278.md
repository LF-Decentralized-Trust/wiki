# Besu : Besu Roadmap &amp; Planning

Created by Felipe Faraggi, last modified by Sally MacFarlane on Nov 21, 2024

This document represents the current working roadmap for Besu. It is a living document, which will evolve and change over time. In particular the features in later versions are likely to change.

We use the approach of #now, #next, #later [used by foursquare](https://medium.com/@noah_weiss/now-next-later-roadmaps-without-the-drudgery-1cfe65656645), with a slightly different time horizon. Our #now scale is about 3 months, #next about 6 months, and #later is 12+ months.

The enterprise roadmap is currently led by [Matthew Whitehead](mailto:matthew.whitehead@kaleido.io) from Kaleido. To discuss the enterprise roadmap items reach out to [matthew.whitehead on the discord server](https://discord.com/invite/hyperledger).

# **Public Roadmap**

# **Enterprise Roadmap**

# Now

## Optimize and Simplify

*Related releases 24.10.x*

- EVM performance optimizations ✅
- Performance benchmarks against other ELs
- Syncing improvements
- Besu as the Linea client
- Prague dev/test/ship
- Deprecation of enterprise features per [sunset plan](https://www.lfdecentralizedtrust.org/blog/sunsetting-tessera-and-simplifying-hyperledger-besu)

## Reduce unnecessary storage (merged)

- Empty-block period ([PR](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/6965) merged, due to be included in 24.10.1)

## Bonsai archive (WIP)

- PR [7475](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/7475)
- Part of the journey towards Bonsai replacing Forest DB
- Make Bonsai an option for retrieving state at arbitrary blocks in the chain

## Improve QBFT recovery time

- PR [7838](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/7838)
- Empty block periods make this especially noticeable because the BFT request
  
  timeout has to be proportional to the empty block period which increase
  
  BFT recovery times after a node outage

# Next

## Prague Fork

*Related releases 25.1.x*

- Prague: polishing
- Ongoing performance work
- Bonsai-friendly Archive Mode
- Plug-in technical docs
- Codebase cleanup for better multi-use-case

## Move QBFT snap sync out of experimental

- Has been out since 24.7.1

## Bonsai archive with state proofs

- Build on PR 7475 to provide proofs for historic state

## Stability under load

- Performance and behaviour when the sequenced transaction pool hits its limits
- Most testing until now has been performance close to the TX pool limits - not beyond them

## Run enterprise acceptance test every release

# Later

## 4444s and Statelessness

*Related releases 25.4.x*

- EIP-4444 history expiry
- Light client exploration
- Verkle Trie ongoing development

## Client Evolution

*Related releases 25.7.x*

- Besu on more Layer 2 networks
- Besu as a customizable L2/L3 sequencer
- Removal of enterprise features per [sunset plan](https://www.lfdecentralizedtrust.org/blog/sunsetting-tessera-and-simplifying-hyperledger-besu)
- Modularity of the protocol schedule
- Modularity everywhere

## Ongoing Protocol Research

- Besu as an Ethereum reference client in Java
- Verkle
- Statelessness State Expiry research

## Move empty block periods out of experimental

- Has been in out since 24.7.1

## Ensure Verkle + Archive has a solution

## Enterprise options for history expiry

- L1 will start dropping block bodies and receipts from 2Q2025
- Enterprises will need to understand the options Besu provides and the architectures that are available to them
- Might involve e.g. option to automatically remove blocks and receipts for chainHead-N blocks for non archive, non-full nodes
