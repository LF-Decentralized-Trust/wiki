# Besu : Plugin Services

Created by Antony Denyer, last modified on Oct 11, 2021

Since the deprecation of bintray and jcenter javadocs are no longer being consumed by [https://javadoc.io/doc/org.hyperledger.besu/plugin-api/latest/index.html](https://javadoc.io/doc/org.hyperledger.besu/plugin-api/latest/index.html)

This is a temporary measure until we start hosting our own javadocs

A manual snapshot was taken on 11 Oct 2021
