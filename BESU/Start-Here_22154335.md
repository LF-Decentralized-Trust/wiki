# Besu : Start Here

Created by Felipe Faraggi, last modified by Sally MacFarlane on Oct 03, 2024

Welcome!

Assuming you've already read the [Code of Conduct](Code-of-Conduct_22154295.html), read on.

Please join our [Discord](Discord_22154456.html) - it's the best place to ask if you have any questions.

To start developing with Besu, you'll want to know how to [build from source](Building-from-source_22154264.html) and be familiar with [coding conventions](Coding-Conventions_22154259.html), and how to [run the tests locally](Testing_22154265.html).

There’s a few different ways to build and run Besu [https://besu.hyperledger.org/public-networks/get-started/install](https://besu.hyperledger.org/public-networks/get-started/install)

- since The Merge, you need to run besu with a CL - see [https://besu.hyperledger.org/public-networks/tutorials/besu-teku-mainnet](https://besu.hyperledger.org/public-networks/tutorials/besu-teku-mainnet) - checkpoint sync is pretty quick
- Note that doing a full sync will take days and take up TB of disk space. Checkpoint is a good option if testing locally. Some info on resource requirements [https://besu.hyperledger.org/public-networks/get-started/system-requirements](https://besu.hyperledger.org/public-networks/get-started/system-requirements)

Ready to [contribute](How-to-Contribute_22156850.html)? Yay!
