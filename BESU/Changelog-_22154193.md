# Besu : Changelog-

Created by Madeline Murray (Deactivated), last modified by Felipe Faraggi on Jan 24, 2020

As agreed at the [2019-12-10 Contributor Call](2019-12-10-Contributor-Call_22154187.html), we are going to include the following in the release changelog: 

- Communication of future breaking changes or deprecated functionality
- New features with a short description of the functionality
- Fixed bugs with a description of the user impact

The following will no longer in included: 

- Every PR contributing to a larger feature
- Internal technical improvements with no user impact
- Bugs fixed in unreleased features

For changes that are to be included in the changelog, the PR author (or feature developer where a number of PRs contribute to the same feature)  
makes a PR on CHANGELOG.md as part of the development process. 

A documentation team member will review and finalise CHANGELOG.md for the release.
