# Besu : Code coverage

Created by Felipe Faraggi, last modified by Sally MacFarlane on Oct 03, 2024

We use the jacoco test coverage plugin, which will generate coverage data whenever tests are run.

To run the report:

./gradlew test jacocoTestReport jacocoRootReport

The report will be available at \`build/reports/jacoco/test/html/index.html\` \`build/reports/jacocoHtml/index.html\`
