**Agenda**

- **Migration from Circle CI to Github Actions.**
  
  - LAST CALL on feedback for GHA migration. Will propose using it (with CircleCI still available as a backup) for the 24.1.2 release.
  - PR is [https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/6427](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/6427)
  - Design Doc is [https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=22155998](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=22155998)
  - NOTES:
    
    - Consensys team to test that maintainers can re-run jobs with current permissions
    - Consensys team to run CircleCI in parallel and measure results from GHA release (ensure that it works and disable Circle)
    - Acceptance on plan broad strokes, targeting 24.1.2 release with GHA (backup Circle)
    - Getting GHA merged in quickly so we can use snapshot builds
- **Defaults** 
  
  - Targeting 24.1.2 release
  - Considering renaming selfish-staker profile
  - Need to determine mechanism for getting everyone to a fully flattened DB (with or without resync)
- **Performance**

  - Acceptance tests run selectively for QBFT networks (price, filtered out of current gradle tasks, available on-demand)
    
    - Price analysis
    - Specific follow up call scheduled
  - Public/Private feature parity
    
    - Snap - need test cases for QBFT and Snap (snap server &amp; snap client tests)
    - Soak / burn testing needs to consider private QBFT networks 
      
      - Sequenced pool needs to be exercised (can be done on Mainnet, private nets)
      - Long-lived, substantial state QBFT network ![(question)](images/icons/emoticons/help_16.png) 
        
        - Repeatable!
    - Scheduled GHA for private nets?
