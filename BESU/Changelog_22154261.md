# Besu : Changelog

Created by Felipe Faraggi, last modified by Nicolas Massart on Aug 24, 2021

As agreed at the [2019-12-10 Contributor Call](2019-12-10-Contributor-Call_22154187.html), we are going to include the following in the release changelog: 

- Communication of future breaking changes or deprecated functionality
- New features with a short description of the functionality
- Fixed bugs with a description of the user impact

The following will no longer be included: 

- Every PR contributing to a larger feature
- Internal technical improvements with no user impact
- Bugs fixed in unreleased features

For changes that are to be included in the changelog, the PR author (or feature developer where a number of PRs contribute to the same feature)  
also commits changes on [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) in the same PR as part of the development process. 

A documentation team member will review and finalize [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for the release.
