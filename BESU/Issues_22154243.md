# Besu : Issues

Created by Felipe Faraggi, last modified by Sally MacFarlane on May 27, 2024

Besu issues are tracked on GitHub. See our [contribution guidelines](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/BESU/How+to+Contribute) for more details on searching and creating issues.

If you've commented on an existing issue and have been waiting for a reply, or want to message us for any other reason, Discord is where to find us. 

# Choosing an Issue to contribute on

When you've identified an issue you'd like to work on, ping us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/hyperledger) in the #besu-contributors channel and we'll assign it to you.

Browse the following lists for easy pickings.

Start by looking through the "good first issue" and "help wanted" labeled issues on the [dashboard](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/issues)

## Good First Issues

The [filtered list of good-first-issues](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/labels/good%20first%20issue) is perfect for contributors wanting to get started with the project.

These are issues which should only require a few lines of code or documentation, and maybe a test or two.

## Help Wanted

[Help-wanted issues](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/labels/help%20wanted) are a bit more involved than \`good first issue\` issues.
