# Besu : Modular Consensus

Created by Matt Nelson (Deactivated) on Jun 27, 2023

# Context

This document lays out a preliminary approach to modularizing the consensus mechanisms in Besu using the plug-in system and accompanying refactoring. The goals of this modularity are to remove friction in development of Besu and to ensure users can always take the latest updates, regardless of their consensus mechanism. 

# First Steps

Establish a working group → Awaiting contributor call July 11th, 2023.
