# Besu : \[WIP] Proposal #4

Created by Tim Beiko, last modified on Feb 14, 2022

After conversations with HLF, ConsenSys and other Besu maintainers, here is an updated proposal for the incentive program which seems to align with everyone's interests: [https://notes.ethereum.org/@timbeiko/besu-cip-proposal-4](https://notes.ethereum.org/@timbeiko/besu-cip-proposal-4). Note: the proposal is still a WIP, and isn't a final legal/grant agreement. The goal is to use this to get alignment at a high level across everyone and then draft a proper agreement. 

Apologies for not posting the proposal directly in the wiki, but it seems like markdown isn't natively supported.
