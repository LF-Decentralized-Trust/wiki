# Besu : Suspend APAC Contributor Call

Created by Simon Dudley, last modified by Sally MacFarlane on Mar 26, 2024

I am proposing that we suspend the APAC timezone contributor call because the only contributors that attend are from Consensys.Â 

Any APAC-friendly contributor-level discussion can be done async in Discord as it already is, or async via the US/EMEA contributor call agenda.

Of course, if anyone wants an APAC ad-hoc call or to restart the regular call, they are welcome to suggest it.

Last call was [2024-03-26 Contributor Call - APAC Friendly Time](2024-03-26-Contributor-Call---APAC-Friendly-Time_22156751.html)
