## Agenda

- A [proposed revocation scheme](https://hackmd.io/Lsz0YRnbQ7C15e0HCIqtng) – based on ALLOSAUR and cryptographic accumulators
  
  - Updates needed to the document:
    
    - During issuance, the Issuer must contact the Revocation Manager (RM) and get back the witnesses for the elements (requires access to the public key)
    - For revocation batches, the Issuer provides the GUIDs of the revoked credential to the RM and gets back a "delta" for each. This is what the issuer publishes to the "revocations" file.
      
      - The "deltas" are 48 bytes of data – 64 characters base64 encoded. Thus, the "revocations" file is 4x the size previously noted.
    - For the performance of the Witness Server
      
      - Assume it takes about 500ms to apply 10000 deltas or 20k/second (where there is 1 delta per revocation of a credential).
      - This is a parallelizeable math operation – it can be parallelized to the number of threads supported by a processor - up to hundreds on a cloud-based server.
      - We would not expect batch sizes above a couple of thousand a day for large volume issuers (millions of credentials in a revocation registry).
      - As such, the bottleneck of the processing is more likely the retrieving and updating of the holder witnesses to storage vs. the witness updating.
- Status update on the Revocation Manager Project
- Not discussed: IIW Presentation from Google about "ZKmdoc" – ZK circuit-based approach to privacy-preserving mDocs
- Open Discussion
