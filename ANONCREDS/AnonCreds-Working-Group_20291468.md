# Hyperledger AnonCreds : AnonCreds Working Group

Created by Stephen Curran, last modified on Jan 05, 2024

The AnonCreds Working Group works on the AnonCreds Specifications (operating under the [Community Specification License v1.0](https://github.com/hyperledger/anoncreds-spec/blob/main/1._Community_Specification_License-v1.md)) and AnonCreds implementations â€“ v1.0 and v2.0. Recent specification and implementation work has been focused on Version 1.0 that covers the existing CL-Signatures-based AnonCreds, agnostic to the underlying ledger, and with support for AnonCreds using the [W3C Verifiable Credentials Data Model Standard](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/). We now have aa AnonCreds v2.0 implementation, and work is beginning on defining the v2.0 specification. The working group meetings focus on a variety of topics related to both versions of AnonCreds.

- AnonCreds v1.0:
  
  - The v1.0 specification is published here: [https://hyperledger.github.io/anoncreds-spec/](https://hyperledger.github.io/anoncreds-spec/)
  - The Working Group uses this GitHub repository to manage the specification: [https://github.com/hyperledger/anoncreds-spec](https://github.com/hyperledger/anoncreds-spec)
  - The v1.0 implementation in Rust is here: [https://github.com/hyperledger/anoncreds-rs](https://github.com/hyperledger/anoncreds-rs)
  - The v1.0 implementation is dependent on this Rust CL Signatures implementation: [https://github.com/hyperledger/anoncreds-clsignatures-rs](https://github.com/hyperledger/anoncreds-spec-v2)
- AnonCreds v2.0
  
  - The initial framework for the v2.0 specification repository is here: [https://github.com/hyperledger/anoncreds-spec-v2](https://github.com/hyperledger/anoncreds-spec-v2)
  - The v2.0 implementation in Rust is here: [https://github.com/hyperledger/anoncreds-v2-rs](https://github.com/hyperledger/anoncreds-v2-rs)
