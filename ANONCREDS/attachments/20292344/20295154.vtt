12
00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:48.619
Patrick: Curious what the the feedback is going to be like from the other members. I'm I'm sure there'll be a divided opinions. But

Stephen Curran: A Rita.

16
00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:07.279
Stephen Curran: Is that the pronunciation? I apologize if I missed it.

17
00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:17.309
Aritra B: Yes, yes, yes, that's the correct pronunciation. Hello!

18
00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:15.100
Stephen Curran: We will wait again. don't know what's gonna happen with this new zoom

19
00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:23.389
Stephen Curran: link. Hopefully enough, people got it, and the word got out. But that was rather sudden on Friday that we changed it all.

20
00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:31.890
Patrick: I guess people read the discord. The should be, yeah should be fine.

21
00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:37.589
Stephen Curran: Rudolph was in the wrong meeting. I just see he's he joined the wrong one.

22
00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:44.150
Stephen Curran: I got an email notification that when the first person joins the meeting

23
00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:51.789
Stephen Curran: so hopefully, you get the word like, I said, that are send. I can send him a note at least

24
00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:22.880
Stephen Curran: the

25
00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:44.820
Patrick: like. My zoom is frozen, or Oh, no. Okay.

26
00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:57.340
Patrick: Well.

27
00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:38.049

Rodolfo Miranda: Hello! How you doing? What's the matter?

29
00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:51.500
Patrick: Yeah. Stefan just left. I think he disconnected. The should be back like his. His camera froze, and then he left so

30
00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:54.429
Patrick: like 1 1 s ago.

Rodolfo Miranda: Yes, unbelievable.

43
00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:35.180

49
00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:34.670
Patrick: What do you mean so far? It's finished the weekend.

50
00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:39.230
Patrick: are you? Are you new to the call to.

51
00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:43.509
Aritra B: Yes, yes, I joined the first time.

52
00:08:43.950 --> 00:08:46.380
Patrick: Okay, cool. What brings you here?

53
00:08:48.030 --> 00:09:02.459
Aritra B: I am mostly interested in Hyper Ledger and on credits, and got to know about 0 knowledge proofs and other these kinds of cryptographic protocols. are you? Like a student or more professional.

54
00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:04.430
Aritra B: I was student.

55
00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:05.780
Patrick: cool.

56
00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:28.060
Patrick: You're familiar with other Hyper ledger project like in the or Aries.

57
00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:31.250
Aritra B: I've walked in fabric.

58
00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:33.920
Aritra B: What's happened?

59
00:09:34.030 --> 00:09:34.900
Yes.

60
00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:39.899
Aritra B: and that was the first one. If I came across and started working.

61
00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:42.239
Aritra B: And after that I got

62
00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:46.300
Aritra B: interested in a, mostly the hyper ledger

63
00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:49.099
Aritra B: and on credits and created projects.

64
00:09:49.690 --> 00:09:50.890
Patrick: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

65
00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:58.350
Patrick: Yeah. And not good is getting a lot of attention. It's fairly new. And that's interesting. Yeah.

66
00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:07.010
Patrick: all fairly new, fairly new as a project of its own. Because before it was part of indie

67
00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:12.300
Patrick: but having an on Chris and its own project. Because I think it's

68
00:10:12.970 --> 00:10:17.509
Patrick: yeah. When was it? For for, like the November around November.

69
00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:23.430
Rodolfo Miranda: when what you say

70
00:10:23.470 --> 00:10:27.349
Patrick: the anon credits project was like.

71
00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.780
Rodolfo Miranda: I, yeah, I should say, so. Yeah, what's left last

72
00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:35.009
Rodolfo Miranda: the end of the last year? Yeah, you're right.

73
00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:36.879
Rodolfo Miranda: It's good to you.

74
00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:42.659
Patrick: Exciting stuff. Yeah, it's different as having issues.

75
00:10:45.370 --> 00:10:49.150
Patrick: maybe we can try to do.

76
00:10:51.950 --> 00:10:56.760
Rodolfo Miranda: Yeah. So so we cancel that. Probably.

77
00:10:57.470 --> 00:11:00.989
Patrick: Yeah. Can wait like 5 more minutes. And

78
00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:02.540
Rodolfo Miranda: okay.

79
00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:11.090
Patrick: are you talking about Mike Slaughter, Alex?

80
00:11:14.210 --> 00:11:21.059
Patrick: I think Pike Lauder, if I just incorrectly, is more involved in the and on credits 2.0.

81
00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:28.129
Patrick: So every week it alternates. So this week is an on credits, 1.0 and next week will be on on credits 2.0

82
00:11:28.950 --> 00:11:34.959
Patrick: not too sure. But I I know he is the

83
00:11:35.230 --> 00:11:41.659
Rodolfo Miranda: they are. The other call is later, because, Mike cannot this time at this time? Yeah.

84
00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:43.049
Patrick: yeah, yeah, yeah.

85
00:12:39.170 --> 00:12:48.829
Patrick: It's like, like, when you did your presentation. But hopefully, you remember, that was funny. Yeah.

86
00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:50.690
Patrick: always at the right time.

87
00:12:51.970 --> 00:12:54.440
Patrick: Good thing you could connect back. Because.

88
00:12:55.660 --> 00:13:05.439
Rodolfo Miranda: yeah, I was, yeah, I I connect from the on the mobile phone. And it was, okay, you know, like we could hear you. And the the video was fine.

89
00:13:11.350 --> 00:13:15.859
Patrick: Did you? attend the workshop a ritual last week?

90
00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:24.139
Aritra B: no, I I did not know about the workshop. I got to know about this in the discord.

91
00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:32.369
Aritra B: So I joined. I actually applied for the hyper legal mentorship program in an on. and I got selected both. So

92
00:13:32.690 --> 00:13:36.280
Aritra B: I I wanted to interact with the community.

93
00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:38.450
Patrick: Yeah.

94
00:13:38.470 --> 00:13:52.799
Patrick: Kuran was supposed to mention. But there, there, there is A. So there was the first an On credits workshop last week. It was like 3 h and a half, and it was very good. And there's a recording on Youtube that if you want to watch it, I think it'll give like a very, very good

95
00:13:53.030 --> 00:14:01.630
Patrick: overview of and on crest. The feature and what's possible in the the direction it's taking, I would strongly recommend that

96
00:14:01.830 --> 00:14:03.619
Patrick: could put you up to speed.

97
00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.040
Aritra B: Yeah, sure.

98
00:14:06.210 --> 00:14:10.279
Patrick: if you just look on the Youtube for the Hyper Ledger Channel.

99
00:14:10.730 --> 00:14:16.930
Patrick: there should be a video titled like an On credits workshop. Something like that.

100
00:14:18.030 --> 00:14:29.420
Patrick:  yeah, I real to that network issue.

101
00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:33.580
Aritra B: Yeah, I found it.

102
00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:40.719
Patrick: Yeah. So you know, just there's some very good slides, as it's mostly Stefan presenting some stuff.

103
00:14:40.950 --> 00:14:42.790
Patrick: there's some slides.

104
00:14:42.890 --> 00:14:54.290
Patrick: there's also like a lab that you can go and create an account. I think it's still up. There should be some details in there somewhere, or if you go in the the discord.

105
00:14:54.580 --> 00:15:03.229
Patrick: there is a channel, and on credits workshop where there's like a few links that you can look at.

106
00:15:03.730 --> 00:15:16.970
Patrick: So it's it's pretty long, like it's 3 h and a half, so you can watch in the pieces. It's separated in 3 parts or 4 parts. but it's it's pretty good. So the the first, like 3,

107
00:15:17.010 --> 00:15:30.719
Patrick: 2 h and a half 3 h, like Stefan, goes over the the concepts, you know, and on credits, how they work, why, they're important, and how how they are different than other types of verifiable credentials.

108
00:15:30.910 --> 00:15:43.950
Patrick: and then goes into more hands on exercise where you publish like schema and issue credential to a mobile wallet, and then the second at the end. It's to presentation. It's

109
00:15:44.010 --> 00:15:53.130
Patrick: presents how to use a non credits on another ledger, which was the, I believe cardinal. Is that right?

110
00:15:53.910 --> 00:15:56.299
Rodolfo Miranda: Correct? Yeah.

111
00:15:56.430 --> 00:16:03.720
Patrick: So how that can be made? And I did a presentation, using it with like a did web method, and some

112
00:16:03.770 --> 00:16:09.919
Patrick: like browser wallet. And so the the end part is like the

113
00:16:10.210 --> 00:16:15.029
Patrick: the sort of ledger agnostic side of add on credits

114
00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:26.239
Patrick: which is the the where they are pushing for, because it's directly on on credits where only usable on in the Hyper Ledger Indie, which is like

115
00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:39.429
Patrick: a different type of blockchain technology. So you say you use fabric, which fabric is a type of blockchain, and Indie is a different type of blockchain that's is strictly catered to identity.

116
00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:55.959
Patrick: you know, managing identity as fabric is more based on transactions, and the well that is, transaction to an Ind. But the the use case is a bit broader for fabric. As it is more so, it was designed specifically for identity and issuing credentials.

117
00:16:56.140 --> 00:17:01.330
Patrick: and then the reason they wanted to separate and on credit.

118
00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:02.949
Patrick: you can sort of

119
00:17:03.730 --> 00:17:11.140
Patrick: issue and and manage the whole life cycle of and on credits using other things than Indie. Right? So

120
00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:16.489
Patrick: that can be the the we did web web server or other ledger like

121
00:17:16.550 --> 00:17:27.220
Patrick: Rudolph, for presented with Cardinal. And I I think there's also a a proof of concept with fabric somewhere. I'm not too sure, however. but I I think I heard that.

122
00:17:29.230 --> 00:17:32.469
Patrick: Okay to make it more. Okay, yeah, thanks for that. I will.

123
00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:34.469
Aritra B: Yeah, I'll go through it.

124
00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:45.840
Patrick: Yeah, yeah. It's important to know a bit. The the history, you know, like the where things came from to to understand the the new decision and new discussions that happen

125
00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:59.640
Patrick: for the mentorship program. I I know Stefan Karen wanted to touch on that today. unfortunate here. you know, I'm just a guy. I don't know much about it. I don't. I? I don't work for Hyper Ledger. So

126
00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:06.490
Rodolfo Miranda: do you know, Rudolph, about the mentorship program?

127
00:18:06.750 --> 00:18:07.990
Patrick: Yeah.

128
00:18:11.140 --> 00:18:15.189
Patrick: All right. Well, I think. so that will be it.

129
00:18:15.850 --> 00:18:26.719
Patrick: Yeah. Cool. So sorry to. I know it's a bad, for it's experience or a retra. Usually it's not like this, really just more people. And but there's a few problems this morning. Apparently.

130
00:18:27.790 --> 00:18:34.540
Rodolfo Miranda: Okay, okay, no issue.

131
00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:36.479
Rodolfo Miranda: Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye.
