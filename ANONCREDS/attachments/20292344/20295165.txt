00:10:08	Stephen Curran:	https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/ANONCREDS/2023-06-19+AnonCreds+Specification+Working+Group+Meeting
00:31:21	Just listening in (~Naian):	What do we mean by 'perception' of tracking vs tracking proper.?
00:35:57	Just listening in (~Naian):	yes
00:36:04	Just listening in (~Naian):	thanks. makes sense
00:38:00	Alex:	Why is it not a requirement to notify the holder and then the holder can ignore the notification? Doesn’t the holder get notified when a credential is issued?
00:38:43	Alex:	That makes sense but why is that the requirement?
00:39:17	Alex:	I see
00:39:24	Alex:	Yes
00:47:33	jje:	We can’t hear you anymore
00:47:38	pasquale:	I think the mic of Stephen is not working anymore
00:47:57	Just listening in (~Naian):	Reacted to "We can’t hear you..." with ➕
00:48:33	Alex:	Not sure if it’s just me but I can’t hear anything
00:48:41	Aritra B.:	same here
00:48:47	Just listening in (~Naian):	same here
00:49:17	Stephen Curran:	Sorry — not sure what is happening.
00:49:41	Just listening in (~Naian):	Maybe a reload might fix it? Zoom bugs sometimes.
00:50:08	pasquale:	Reacted to "Maybe a reload might..." with 👍
00:51:25	Just listening in (~Naian):	yess!
00:51:27	pasquale:	yes
00:55:04	jje:	Can you point to some reference material for LVVM?
00:55:25	Just listening in (~Naian):	Does the scheme (revocationegistry+revocationId) enable verifier to re-verify at later point in time? (i.e a while after the presentation)

Basically, is revocation checking ability for a vc unlimited.

would that property be considered a privacy negative. ? (I think it should)
00:55:26	jje:	Reacted to "Can you point to som..." with 👍
00:57:43	Just listening in (~Naian):	cool, thanks for the clarification
00:57:47	Just listening in (~Naian):	thank you!
