## Agenda

Open Issue

- [PRs](https://github.com/hyperledger/anoncreds-spec/pulls) for review and merging
- [Issues to Discuss](https://github.com/hyperledger/anoncreds-spec/labels/Discuss%20at%20Meeting)
- Any update on what "prover\_did" is used for during AnonCreds processing?
  
  - Does the value require any special characteristics when it is used in the AnonCreds code?
  - Any insight on why it was added in the first place?
  - If we were to deprecate it as an input, would we need to use something else to replace it in the AnonCreds code?
- Help with dependabot pull request: [113](https://github.com/hyperledger/anoncreds-spec/pull/113)
- Checkin: anoncreds-rs implementation progress, requests
- Open Discussion

## Future Calls

## To Dos:

- Issue to be added and further investigation into what happens to the nonce(s) by Belsy.
- Backwards Compatibility
  
  - PRs in (#[82](https://github.com/hyperledger/anoncreds-spec/pull/82), #[105](https://github.com/hyperledger/anoncreds-spec/pull/105)) that seem to change public data structures – ones that are handled outside of AnonCreds and/or by two or more participants (issuer, holder, verifier)
  - We want to retain compatibility with existing data – credentials that have been issued and the published AnonCreds objects on which they rely.
  - That extends to business logic – e.g. the handling of the objects not just by AnonCreds, AnonCreds Methods and Aries Frameworks, but also by business applications built on Aries.
  - Suggestion:
    
    - Include in the specification a statement about backward compatibility
      
      - Perhaps this is what Ankur had planned to do?
    - Formalize what data structures will be expected by AnonCreds
      
      - This is being done throughout the specification and verified against the current implementation.
    - As needed support sending and receiving data in "old" and "new" formats, but (for now) always sending "old" formats.
      
      - TBD if there are any such cases.

## Action items

- Adding support for W3C Format AnonCreds to the anoncreds implementation and the spec.
- Issue -- should "encoded" generation be handled by the Issuer or within AnonCreds?
  
  - Formalize the encoding in the specification
  - Transition to "encoding in AnonCreds" ASAP
- Links to be referenced in the spec and used where needed:
