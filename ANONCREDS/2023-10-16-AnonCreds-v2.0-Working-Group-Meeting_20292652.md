## Goals of the Working Group:

The goal of AnonCreds v2.0 is to retain and extend the privacy-preserving features of AnonCreds v1.0, while improving capabilities, performance, extensibility, and security.

## Meeting Preliminaries:

- Welcome and Introductions
- Announcements:
  
  - AnonCreds v2.0 Rust Open Source Code now Available: [https://github.com/hyperledger/anoncreds-v2-rs](https://github.com/hyperledger/anoncreds-v2-rs)
  - Agora repository transfers pending...

## Agenda

- Update from IIW – [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-07WrKtLxIf6ymdmQyU3ssg0R4XrGJkMBAxIE9i6NMU/edit?usp=sharing) given, response from the IIW community
- The AnonCreds V2 To Do List – ready to work?
  
  - Ordering
  - Adding Issues to outline the work
- AnonCreds Specification PRs
- Open Discussion

## Future Calls

- Collect some use case specific examples and continue the discussions:
  
  - Applying the data structures to a real use case or two
    
    - Take an existing AnonCreds Schema (maybe [this](https://candyscan.idlab.org/tx/CANDY_PROD/domain/13)) and Credential Definition (maybe [this](https://candyscan.idlab.org/tx/CANDY_PROD/domain/14)) and define what it would be using Mike's proposed data models.
      
      - Where would the data models exist, such as on ledger, in the AnonCreds specification?
  - What concrete uses other than link-secret is there for blinded data in a credential?

## To Dos:

Schema Claim Type:

- Would it make sense defining encodings for date related schema claim types that are especially useful to use in ZKP predicates?
  
  - "iso860\_date" – encodes to dateint e.g., 2023.06.26 is 20230626
  - "iso860\_datetime" - encodes to Unix Time e.g., seconds since Jan 1, 1970
- Yes – these would be "numbers" by type, but with special encoding handling.
