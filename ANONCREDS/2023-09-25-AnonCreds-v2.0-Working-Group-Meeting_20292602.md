## Goals of the Working Group:

The goal of AnonCreds v2.0 is to retain and extend the privacy-preserving features of AnonCreds v1.0, while improving capabilities, performance, extensibility, and security.

## Meeting Preliminaries:

- Welcome and Introductions
- Announcements:
  
  - AnonCreds Rust [0.2.0-dev1](https://github.com/hyperledger/anoncreds-rs/releases/tag/v0.2.0-dev.1) released! Update to AnonCreds CL Signatures implementation with fixes and performance improvements.

## Agenda

- [Hyperledger Labs Agora](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/hyperledger-labs.github.io/pull/249) – an implementation of (the planned) AnonCreds 2.0 – and more!
  
  - "Unknown Order" library – wrapper of all the well known BigNumber libraries – pick a back end, go...
    
    - Constant time libraries for security.
    - Why "unknown order" – don't know the order unless you know the secret – MPC relies on a group of Big Nums unknown\_order – blob of binary that you have to know about to interpret
    - Side note: class groups is coming for a similar purpose
  - Paillier RS
  - blsful ("Blissful") – BLS Signatures – everything in BLS Signatures, and what's needed in AnonCreds 2.0.
    
    - Signing, verifying, threshold signing, assembling
    - Algomar proofs Key shares
    - sign\_crypt – sign and encrypt/decrypt and verify
    - Wrapper around Intel's blst ("Blast") library – hides
  - CredX – anoncreds 2.0
    
    - Not part of Agora – likely to go to AnonCreds directly.
    - Being worked to break out the components, so CredX is more glue, less cryptography.
- Open Discussion

## Future Calls

- Collect some use case specific examples and continue the discussions:
  
  - Applying the data structures to a real use case or two
    
    - Take an existing AnonCreds Schema (maybe [this](https://candyscan.idlab.org/tx/CANDY_PROD/domain/13)) and Credential Definition (maybe [this](https://candyscan.idlab.org/tx/CANDY_PROD/domain/14)) and define what it would be using Mike's proposed data models.
      
      - Where would the data models exist, such as on ledger, in the AnonCreds specification?
  - What concrete uses other than link-secret is there for blinded data in a credential?

## To Dos:

Schema Claim Type:

- Would it make sense defining encodings for date related schema claim types that are especially useful to use in ZKP predicates?
  
  - "iso860\_date" – encodes to dateint e.g., 2023.06.26 is 20230626
  - "iso860\_datetime" - encodes to Unix Time e.g., seconds since Jan 1, 1970
- Yes – these would be "numbers" by type, but with special encoding handling.
