# Climate Action SIG : 2022-04-06 Peer Programming Call

Created by Si Chen, last modified on Apr 06, 2022

**Summary**

- Discuss use case for [Reducing Methane Leakage and Flaring through Supply Chain Tokens](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/events/pages/21792644/Reducing+Methane+Leakage+and+Flaring+through+Supply+Chain+Tokens)

See videos below:

Production data is the output of an oil &amp; gas facility.  For example, its fields could include:

- Company name
- Facility location = Oil refinery at XXX
- Dates = 2021-01-01 to 2021-12-31
- Quantites of Fuel = 1 million liters (or gallons, etc.)
- Type of Fuel = Diesel
- Scope = 3
- Type = Downstream Embedded Emissions
- Emissions = a number in kgCo2e

Audited Emissions Certificate is the audited emissions of the production process.  It could include all sorts of data points about the production, but in this case it is just CH4 (methane) flaring and leakage.

Combining Production Data + AEC we can calculate a C-NFT token which is the additional embedded emissions from flared gas and CH4 leakage per unit of fuel, for example 1000 L of diesel.

The diagram in the video shows combining

1. company data
2. multiple independent sources of methane flaring and leakage, through trusted auditor or DAO, to get to the AEC.

To produce the C-NFT of the downstream emissions.

The C-NFT can server as an on-chain, verified data point.

Or it could be transferred as a "relative performance" indicator for fuel that has lower methane flaring/leakage than the industry average. 

For next steps we will look at:

1. Production data examples
2. Audited flaring examples
3. Average methane flaring data - World Bank

The problem is the emissions factors are based on chemistry properties of the fuel when combusted, not the embedded emissions of the production process.  So how do we transfer the C-NFT to help incentivize fuel consumers to purchase lower methane fuels?
