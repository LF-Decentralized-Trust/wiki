   Title: TraceChain - Waste Management &amp; Green Financing.
   
   Description:   Naresh Co-founder COO talking about Tracechain - Waste Management &amp; Green Financing
   
   Mismanagement of waste is a critical issue that leads to the unfortunate death of more than half a million people every year.
   
   In a circular economy, Producers/Brand owners have a crucial role to play in collecting back waste or post-consumer products and being compliant.
   
   However, the lack of trust and traceability is a significant challenge due to inaccurate and unreliable data, non-compliances, and the largely informal sector of waste processing.
   
   Snapper is solving this problem by accounting and tracking recycled waste using a unique blockchain-powered solution.
