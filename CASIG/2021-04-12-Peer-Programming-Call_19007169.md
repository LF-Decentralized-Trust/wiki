# Climate Action SIG : 2021-04-12 Peer Programming Call

Created by Si Chen on Apr 12, 2021

Today we showed the production deployment of the [Emissions Data Channel](Emissions-Data-Channel_19006106.html) and the [Emissions Tokens Network](Emissions-Tokens-Network_19006546.html).  Thank you [kamlesh nagware](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/557058:8e1fc425-f938-4b39-ad13-9cd8b0ddde52?ref=confluence) for explaining how to use the Hyperledger Fabric Explorer.

As part of it we went through different architectural choices of Fabric and Ethereum and issues of deploying on a public network like xDai.  

Thank you everybody for your helpful input.
