1. Homework for all: read through toucan.earth protocol
2. CJP and AH to describe the pipeline for developing our protobufs and other formats with interaction with the implemented world.
3. Check out [validator.schema.org](http://validator.schema.org).
4. Connect with GBBC, other standards bodies (suggested by Alfonso). Also connect with Martin W and Tom B again.
5. Ask people in the implemented world to look at our code and fill in a questionnaire that evaluates the usefulness of our code base.
6. Alfonso question: How do we get different actors in the implemented world to agree on a taxonomy? What tools already exist for developing a taxonomy/ontology/standard among a large number of different players? Alfonso to look into possible tools (starting with Slack and Discord).
7. Global Standards Mapping Initiative (
