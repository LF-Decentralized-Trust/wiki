# Climate Action SIG : Investor Climate Disclosure

Created by Si Chen, last modified on Apr 18, 2022

## Relevant Standards

- [CDP (Carbon Disclosure Project)](https://www.cdp.net/en) is a self-reported survey of carbon emissions and policies by companies.  Here is an example of [Adobe's response to CDP questionnaire](https://www.adobe.com/content/dam/cc/en/corporate-responsibility/pdfs/Adobe_CDP_Climate_Change_Questionnaire_2021.pdf).  The data they collect is available to paid subscribers.
- [Science Based Target Initiative (SBTi)](https://sciencebasedtargets.org/) validates companies' climate programs against the Paris Agreement 1.5 degree goals.  They publish [standards for emissions reductions by industry](https://sciencebasedtargets.org/sectors), the [Sectoral Decarbonization Approach](https://sciencebasedtargets.org/sectors), including a spreadsheet tool of the targets, and a [list of companies taking action with their emissions reduction targets](https://sciencebasedtargets.org/companies-taking-action).  There are currently 1750 companies with either approved targets or in the process (committed.)  They do not monitor the progress of companies' emissions programs.
- [Transition Pathway Initiative](https://www.transitionpathwayinitiative.org/) (TPI) assess management awareness of climate issues and carbon performance based on International Energy Agency (IEA) Energy Technology Perspectives report.  Their methodology is detailed [here](https://www.transitionpathwayinitiative.org/publications/65.pdf).
- [Climate Action 100+ Net Zero Benchmark](https://www.climateaction100.org/progress/net-zero-company-benchmark/) is focused on about 160 top emitting companies, relying in part on TPI data.  Their [2020 report](https://www.climateaction100.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/CA100-Progress-Report.pdf) has detailed information about the companies.
- Greenhouse Gas Protocol sets the standard for corporate emissions calculation.  They have published standards guidelines and a [sample GHG Protocol calculator](https://ghgprotocol.org/ghg-emissions-calculation-tool).
- Taskforce for Climate Finance Disclosure (TCFD) and Sustainable Accounting Standards Board (SASB) are general guidelines for reporting on climate and sustainability.  Take a look at the [TCFD disclosures](https://about.ups.com/content/dam/upsstories/assets/reporting/sustainability-2021/2020_UPS_TCFD_Report_081921.pdf) and [SASB disclosures](https://about.ups.com/content/dam/upsstories/assets/reporting/sustainability-2021/2020_UPS_SASB_Standards_Table_081921.pdf) for UPS as examples.
- Global Reporting (GRI) is a more comprehensive set of reporting standards.  See both Adobe and UPS below for examples of GRI reports.

## Examples of Corporate Climate Disclosures

Let's look at a few companies:

- Adobe - [Corporate Social Responsibility](https://www.adobe.com/corporate-responsibility/corporate-responsibility-reports.html)
  
  - Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions - [CSR Report](https://www.adobe.com/content/dam/cc/en/corporate-responsibility/pdfs/Adobe-CSR-Report-2020.pdf) page 22
  - Third party verified emissions - [Audit letter](https://www.adobe.com/content/dam/cc/en/corporate-responsibility/pdfs/Adobe-GHG-Assurance-Review-Letter-2020.pdf)
  - Breakdown of Scope 3 emissions - Not available
  - Emissions reduction targets - Not in CSR report but it is on the SBTi list of [companies taking action](https://sciencebasedtargets.org/companies-taking-action) (search for Adobe): "*Adobe Inc. commits to reduce absolute scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions 35% by 2025 from a 2018 base year. Adobe commits to reduce absolute scope 3 GHG emissions from business travel 30% over the same timeframe. Adobe also commits that 55% of its suppliers by spend covering purchased goods and services and capital goods, will have science-based targets by 2025.  The targets covering greenhouse gas emissions from company operations (scopes 1 and 2) are consistent with reductions required to keep warming to 1.5°C.*"
- American Airlines - [Environmental, social, and governance](https://www.aa.com/i18n/customer-service/about-us/environmental-social-governance.jsp)
  
  - Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions - [AAG Environmental Data report](https://www.aa.com/content/images/customer-service/about-us/corporate-governance/aag-2020-environmental-data.pdf)
  - Thid party verified emissions - last page of Environmental Data report
  - Breakdown of Scope 3 emissions - Not available,
  - Emissions reduction targets - "Committed" under SBTi but no definite target set here.  According to the [2020 ESG Report](https://www.aa.com/content/images/customer-service/about-us/corporate-governance/aag-esg-report-2019-2020.pdf), the goal is to "*Achieve net zero direct carbon emissions by 2050*" through a combination of upgrading to more efficient aircraft, switching to sustainable aviation fuel, energy efficiency and renewable energy on the ground, and carbon offsetting via CORSIA.
- UPS - [Social Impact Reporting](https://about.ups.com/us/en/social-impact/reporting.html)
  
  - Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions - [TCFD disclosures](https://about.ups.com/content/dam/upsstories/assets/reporting/sustainability-2021/2020_UPS_TCFD_Report_081921.pdf) page 5
  - Emissions are not third party verified.  An audit letter on page 6 of [SASB report](https://about.ups.com/content/dam/upsstories/assets/reporting/sustainability-2021/2020_UPS_SASB_Standards_Table_081921.pdf) says that their auditor has reviewed their SASB disclosures (which includes only Scope 1 and Scope 3 contractors' fuel emissions)
  - Breakdown of Scope 3 emissions - Not available
  - Emissions reduction targets - In TCFD and SASB disclosures, "*...an environmental sustainability goal – achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. The road map to carbon neutrality by 2050 includes the following targets: • By 2025 o 25% renewable electricity for facilities (existing goal). o 40% alternative fuel purchases as a percent of total ground fuel (existing goal). • By 2035 o 30% sustainable aviation fuel. o 100% renewable electricity for facilities. o 50% reduction in CO2 per package delivered for global small package (2010 baseline).* "
