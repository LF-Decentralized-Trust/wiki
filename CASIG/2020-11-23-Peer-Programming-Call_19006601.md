# Climate Action SIG : 2020-11-23 Peer Programming Call

Created by Si Chen, last modified on Nov 23, 2020

In today's Peer Programming call we discussed the following:

Using [Trust ID](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/TrustID) to store security credentials for the [utility emissions channel](Emissions-Data-Channel_19006106.html).  [Robin Klemens](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/5b068694a595df5d0a165a66?ref=confluence)gave us a demo of the progress so far.  [David Thomson](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/5c9bd430ba8bf7223028b7eb?ref=confluence) has made a repository at [https://github.com/djat/trustid-openclimate](https://github.com/djat/trustid-openclimate)  The goal is to have private keys stored in wallets and public keys stored on the ledger.

Using the Capital Markets SIG's [eThaler](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/eThaler)'s central bank digital currency (CBDC) issuance feature for [net emissions tokens](Emissions-Tokens-Network_19006546.html).  This is a very interesting project and offers a lot of potential for more sophisticated networks of climate accounting and linking climate to finance.  This would involve connecting Fabric with Besu/Ethereum.  We're going to look into using [Cactus](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/cactus/overview) for this.  

Business models discussions from the Open Climate Collabathon last week.  See the [Business Models list](https://collabathon-docs.openclimate.earth/prompts-1/2020-working-groups/hyperledger-working-group/business-model-ideas-and-coordination) from the collabathon.  [Martin Wainstein](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/5af98bd1e608115790242590?ref=confluence) talked about the [Open Solar](https://openlab.yale.edu/open-solar) and [Raise Green](https://www.raisegreen.com/) for funding solar development.  If you have other business model or product ideas, please comment below, and we'll add you to the list as well.
