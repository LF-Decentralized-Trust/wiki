## **About the Climate Ledger Initiative**

**Climate change** is one of the world’s most pressing problems. The Climate Ledger Initiative (“CLI”) addresses this challenge with one of the world’s most promising technological innovations; **blockchain and distributed ledger technology** combined with other innovative information technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and the use of remote sensing.

The CLI addresses policy and research questions and identifies specific innovation opportunities to contribute to climate change mitigation and adaptation and accelerate the implementation of the **Paris Agreement** by:

- Providing an [international platform](https://climateledger.org/en/Events.30.html) to bring together the climate and technology communities to facilitate exchange of learnings and knowledge sharing and engage innovators
- Enabling the testing of concepts and approaches in concrete [use cases](https://climateledger.org/en/Use-Cases.33.html)
- Extracting and documenting lessons learnt and making them publicly available in [knowledge products](https://climateledger.org/en/Knowledge.25.html) and our flagship [Navigating Report](https://climateledger.org/en/Knowledge.25.html)
