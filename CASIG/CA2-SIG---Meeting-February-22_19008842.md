**3) Join us March 8 for the next CA2SIG general meeting, for a presentation by the BC Government and Open Earth Foundation on their work together -  Mines Digital Trust Carbon Accounting Use Case**

Speakers:

- Martin Wainstein, Open Earth Foundation
- Nancy Norris, Government of BC
- Kyle Robinson, Briartech Consulting

Description:  

- This presentation and session at the CA2SIG will deep dive into an implementation of Hyperledger Indy and Aries, under the Trust Over IP Framework, using Decentralized Identifiers and Verifiable Credentials to establish trusted interactions between multiple agents and climate stakeholders. Particularly we'll review the network where subnational governments (like British Columbia), Natural Resource Corporations (like Mining Companies), Auditors and Verifiers, and other agents across a supply chain integrate carbon and climate data for both jurisdictional and corporate inventories, as well as corresponding carbon adjustments when products cross borders.
- The Ministry of Energy, Mines and Low Carbon Innovation (EMLI) from the British Columbia government has been collaborating with the Open Earth Foundation and their Open Climate network and platform to pilot a Digital Trust Network that is relevant to Mining operations and broader Paris-level integrated accounting. Both entities presented their work at COP26 in Glasgow in collaboration with UNFCCC and will walkthrough current status and next steps.
