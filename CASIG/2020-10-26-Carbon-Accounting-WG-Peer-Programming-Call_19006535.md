# Climate Action SIG : 2020-10-26 Carbon Accounting WG Peer Programming Call

Created by Si Chen, last modified on Nov 09, 2020

In today's call [Martin Wainstein](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/5af98bd1e608115790242590?ref=confluence) shared this slide about a common architecture from his [Climate Development System deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1jYCY9EaAuWNWWX_GApymAUaa-yhnm9cV8Lc2fgwV0io/edit#slide=id.ga4d5e7ae50_0_5):

The idea (from bottom up) is:

1. Business processes at the bottom
2. Through DID credentials
3. Store data on the ledger
4. Which satisfy protocols and taxonomies
5. Are made available through clients
6. To a variety of applications that access them

In his deck is an application of this to solar financing.

One question is whether it's one ledger or a mix of different ledgers, permissioned and public.  The answer seems to depend on the application itself.  Sometimes a second ledger is just used as a payment processor, and sometimes applications will regularly interact with ledgers.

We then come again to the question of DID's and using Indy and Aries to manage identities.  Martin shared [Trust Over IP primer](https://trustoverip.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/98/2020/05/toip_050520_primer.pdf), [Robin Klemens](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/5b068694a595df5d0a165a66?ref=confluence) shared the [TrustID project](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/TrustID) for identities with fabric. This is definitely a direction we want to move towards, after we get a proof of concept up and running.

This architecture will be used as a basis for working in the upcoming [Open Climate Collabathon](https://www.collabathon.openclimate.earth/), so if you have any thoughts or suggestions, please speak up!

Finally we talked more about deployig the utility emissions channel to production.  We'll look into setting up a test deployment using the [Azure blockchain as a service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/blockchain/templates/hyperledger-fabric-consortium-azure-kubernetes-service) as well as see how to set up the [configtx.yaml](https://github.com/opentaps/blockchain-carbon-accounting/blob/master/utility-emissions-channel/docker-compose-setup/configtx/configtx.yaml) based on the one from [fabric sample config](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/tree/master/sampleconfig) for deploying a custom network using docker and kubernetes.  Initially we're just going to have a small, 2 node network with 2 organizations running it, each with a peer, orderer, and certificate authority (CA.)  The CA will generate certificates for all the users accessing that particular node. 

There's a lot more in the [recorded video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKSNJ_y64Jk&feature=youtu.behttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DzKSNJ_y64Jk&feature=youtu.be) – it's too big to upload to this wiki so I put it on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKSNJ_y64Jk&feature=youtu.be).  The demo in the video didn't work, so here's a link to a [video of a working demo](https://youtu.be/zIYfjF4U2G8) to show you what it all looks like.
