# Climate Action SIG : TODOs

Created by Christiaan Pauw, last modified by Alex Ivan Howard on Sep 15, 2024

## This page contains a list of outstanding tasks.

01. Complete the axioms for:
    
    1. claim (v)
    2. report (v)
    3. verify
    4. audit (v)
    5. measure
    6. report (n)
    7. developer
02. Think about "attesting" and "attestation".
03. Create proper, fully elaborated example of a project expressed in AIAO.
04. Consider creating an "Arithmetic" class.
05. Create a stronger link in the protos between activities and environments.
06. Continue with term/class definitions.
07. Expand the second and third… n levels of the ontology, as necessary.
    
    1. "sensor" and "actuator" are good candidates for subclasses to the "instrument" class.
    2. What should the subclasses to thing:claim be? E.g., where would "measurement" fit in? Should we first distinguish between qualitative and quantitative claims?
08. Update the diagram with the latest axioms.
09. Add a definition and example to each of the classes in Protégé. Also do it on this page.
10. Align the ontology with [OWL specifications and syntax](https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-syntax/#Object_Property_Axioms).
11. Incorporate W3C's time ontology (owl-time) into ours. Wouter already did some work on this in the past.
12. See if we can use any of these ontologies for the spatial classes: [W3C](https://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/geo/XGR-geo-ont-20071023/#ontologies), [DBpedia](https://dbpedia.org/ontology/location)
13. Check out Regen1's place-based stuff.
14. Review [PROV-O](https://www.w3.org/TR/2013/REC-prov-o-20130430/) (provenance ontology). Wouter worked on it a bit already.
15. Embed ontology into [BFO](https://basic-formal-ontology.org/) and its [extensions](https://obofoundry.org/). Some useful resources: [BFO 6-part video series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muafRW0bXgw&list=PLyngZgIl3WTj6tWcypTLpCnYXu6o93kD4). Perhaps check if we should not rather go with [AFO](https://www.w3.org/wiki/HCLS/AFO_Foundational_Ontology).
16. Review [UN SEEA](https://seea.un.org/) terminology.
17. Can we / should we try to align our ontology with [ISDA CDM](https://www.isda.org/2019/10/14/isda-common-domain-model/)?
18. Develop tools for applying the ontology (see [our GitHub repo](https://github.com/aartum/CA2-SIG-StandardsWG) for what has already been done).
19. Get industry entities to test our ontology &amp; tools. Possible testers:
    
    1. SAP ([https://community.sap.com/topics/sustainability/climate21](https://community.sap.com/topics/sustainability/climate21))
20. Review PACT and their Pathfinder tool:
    
    1. - [https://www.carbon-transparency.com/resources](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.carbon-transparency.com%2Fresources&sa=D&source=calendar&usd=2&usg=AOvVaw3r5pNQUnL70-NgNmxfnMkT)
    2. - [https://www.carbon-transparency.com/media/jpslsujn/pathfinder-framework.pdf](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.carbon-transparency.com%2Fmedia%2Fjpslsujn%2Fpathfinder-framework.pdf&sa=D&source=calendar&usd=2&usg=AOvVaw3HI9hYZCDrru66EQSli1AX)
21. Check out: [https://w3c-ccg.github.io/traceability-vocab/#undefinedTerm\\]() (Wouter has possibly worked on this already.)
22. Update [landing page](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/CASIG/Standards+WG).
23. How does W3C's "claim" schema for VCs compare to our "claim" class?
24. Keep tabs on [OS Climate](https://os-climate.org/).
25. How does the UN SEEA framework compare to our ontology?
26. Submit a paper about our work to the Semantic Web Journal ([www.semantic-web-journal.net](http://www.semantic-web-journal.net/)).
27. Test our control class against [https://www.api.org/-/media/Files/Policy/ESG/GHG/API\_Climate\_Reporting\_Factsheet.pdf](https://www.api.org/-/media/Files/Policy/ESG/GHG/API_Climate_Reporting_Factsheet.pdf).
28. Causality: How is causality expressed mathematically?
29. Check out: [https://www.ecometricsllc.com/what-we-do/](https://www.ecometricsllc.com/what-we-do/)
30. Make sure we've explained our alignment to / differentiation from [CDM's glossary](https://cdm.unfccc.int/newsroom/factsheets/docs/glos_CDM.pdf) everywhere applicable.
31. Review [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.02711.pdf](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Farxiv.org%2Fpdf%2F2304.02711.pdf&sa=D&source=calendar&usd=2&usg=AOvVaw2z1gLL4cJdjZsUHgg5y8yg) (from Henriette).
32. Review [https://henrietteharmse.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/uml-class-diagram-to-owl-and-sroiq-reference.pdf](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fhenrietteharmse.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2017%2F11%2Fuml-class-diagram-to-owl-and-sroiq-reference.pdf&sa=D&source=calendar&usd=2&usg=AOvVaw2cHRhxrB9MdKwupjNRvxTy) (from Henriette).
33. Check out [https://www.worldstandardscooperation.org/](https://www.worldstandardscooperation.org/).
34. Get other experts to review the ontology etc., e.g., Szymon Klarman.
35. Check out: [https://lov.linkeddata.es/dataset/lov](https://lov.linkeddata.es/dataset/lov).
36. Check out: [http://ns.nature.com/terms/Agent](http://ns.nature.com/terms/Agent).
37. Check out: [http://www.cidoc-crm.org/cidoc-crm/E39\_Actor](http://www.cidoc-crm.org/cidoc-crm/E39_Actor).
