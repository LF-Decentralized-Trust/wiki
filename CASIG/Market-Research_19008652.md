# Climate Action SIG : Market Research

Created by Robin Klemens, last modified by Ermanno Camerinelli on Jun 05, 2022

Dear  CA2SIG Members,

as part of my research work for the realization of a blockchain-based platform for measuring and reporting ESG impacts in a CSR perspective I created this online questionnaire: 

[https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSehSv304HHxK6PqdDpaWCXLa63mMGrAX82lPjVZXbDSnLXX8g/viewform?usp=pp\_url](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSehSv304HHxK6PqdDpaWCXLa63mMGrAX82lPjVZXbDSnLXX8g/viewform?usp=pp_url)

With this questionnaire I wish to capture the main challenges and opportunities that you expect sustainability and reporting can bring to your company.

I may invite you for a separate call to discuss further.

Feel free to disclose this questionnaire with your network!  
The anonymized results of this research will be disclosed via articles and blogs: I will share a copy as soon as available.

Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is the idea that a business has a responsibility to the society and environment in which it operates (acc. to Sustainable Business Strategy). With new developments such as the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive which extends the scope of CSR reporting and requires the audit of reported information, corporations must seek new ways to capture and share trusted information about their impact. There is a growing demand for CSR reporting and the current state of the art needs to change to address stakeholders' needs.
