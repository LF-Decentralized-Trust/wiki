# Climate Action SIG : 2022-04-25 Peer Programming Call

Created by Si Chen, last modified on Apr 28, 2022

**Summary**

- Discussed how the C-NFT for the [Oil &amp; Gas Methane Emissions Reduction Project](19008903.html) should be used.  In conclusion, it's an NFT which means it should not be sub-divided but rather could be used as a "certificate of fuel carbon intensity" which could be issued for each lot of purchase.  Thus, each time a customer such as a utility buys a batch of fuel from an oil producer, a C-NFT could be issued as a token of the embedded emissions for that lot, based on the emissions recorded during the production of the fuel.
