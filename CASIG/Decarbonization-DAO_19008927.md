# Climate Action SIG : Decarbonization DAO

Created by Si Chen, last modified on Mar 16, 2022

The Decarbonization (deCO2) DAO puts together the [DAO](DAO_19007052.html), the [Emissions Tokens Network](Emissions-Tokens-Network_19006546.html), the [Supply Chain Decarbonization](Supply-Chain-Decarbonization_19006065.html),and the [Oil &amp; Gas Methane Emissions Reduction Project](19008903.html) to create real climate action that decarbonizes the key transportation and energy sectors.

Every year, the effects of climate change are more apparent, and so is the need for real climate action. Unfortunately, carbon offsets and carbon removals will not be enough to solve the problem. There simply is not enough land out there for forests to absorb all the carbon being emitted. Nor can we wait for futuristic carbon removal technologies:  Today's companies are making trillion dollar capital investment decisions that will last for decades. If they choose to invest in business-as-usual, high emissions assets, then we could never win the climate race.

The only possible solution to climate change is to decarbonize the real economy--shipping, transportation, power generation, manufacturing--as quickly as possible. The challenge is that low carbon technologies may take years to develop, and then we must create markets for them so that they could scale up.

Leveraging the other projects we've already developed, this DAO will build a decentralized community of serious climate activists who will work together to decarbonize key sectors.  We will start with shipping and travel, which together account for 8 billion tons of CO2e Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions per year.

So if you've ever received a package, flown in an airplane, or taken a trip, you have a carbon footprint that could be quantified and decarbonized. Join us to help develop this project and chart a course together to stop climate change.

What we are building in the next phase:

- Scope 3 emissions calculation based on travel, shipping, and supply chain
- A more user-friendly web and mobile dApp
- Collectively determining the actual carbon intensity of fuels produced, based on the producers' level of methane and Scope 1 and 2 emissions.  This will require going through and analyzing multiple sources of company reported, satellite, and third party data.
- Long-term staking for tokens for low carbon fuels
- Tokenizing true sustainable low carbon fuels, such as biodiesel and aviation fuels, which do not cause deforestation, food stress, and water use.
- A DAO community focused on serious issues such as how to decarbonize, whether low carbon fuels are valid climate claims, and what (if any) offsets should be included.

## How Will this DAO Work?

There are a lot of different viewpoints on climate out there, so how do we know which one is true?

The goal of this DAO is to arrive at "the truth" collectively based on the members' reputation.

Each member who joins the DAO will receive a fixed amount reputation tokens.  You can earn more reputation tokens by providing quality work, such as providing your input about a topic.  Or you can delegate your reputation tokens to someone else to add reputation to their work.

The DAO will pull together all the inputs on a topic and their respective authors.  Some of these may come from sources who are not DAO members right now, such as company reports, other open source projects, third party research, etc.  

The DAO will then aggregate the reputation votes for each and use it to arrive at a collective answer.
