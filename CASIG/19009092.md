# Climate Action SIG : Market/Ecosystem Research Project - Supply Chain Decarbonization

Created by Woody Moore, last modified on Jan 03, 2023

## Objective

In order for the [Supply Chain Decarbonization Project](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/CASIG/Supply+Chain+Decarbonization) to be successful, we need to understand:

- The pain points that will inform the solution that stakeholders need
- The market dynamics that will inform business model to make this solution sustainable
- The partnerships that can provide us with development/financial support and help lead to market awareness and adoption of the solution.

To accomplish this, the CA2SIG will engage the following stakeholder groups working on the challenge of Scope 3 emissions mitigation.

- Oil and Natural Gas Producers
- Investors
- Government
- Solution Providers
- Development Institutions

**Role Summary:** The Stakeholder Analysis Research Project will provide intelligence to support the Supply Chain Decarbonization Project. This non-technical opportunity to contribute has been broken down into several key project areas. Please feel free to take on one project or many by adding your name in the fields provided and contacting Sherwood Moore who will be providing support for your work on this project.
