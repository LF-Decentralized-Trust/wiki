# Climate Action SIG : Events and Presentation Opps Project

Created by Woody Moore, last modified on Oct 29, 2021

The objective of this projects is to help the CA2SIG discover relevant events to attend and build awareness around climate accounting and the Climate Action and Accounting Special Interest Group by submitting for and participating in speaking events, roundtable discussions, panels, and webinars.

To accomplish this, this project will provide a centralized location for members to:

- Build and contribute to a calendar of events that members can attend.
- Identify opportunities for speaking events for members, including deadlines and links for speaking proposal deadlines
- Share best practices, language, and past presentation decks to help inform/support the submission of speaking proposals and presentations themselves.
