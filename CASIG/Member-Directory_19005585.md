Lisa ButtersHoneywellGeneral Manager, [GoDirect Trade](http://www.godirecttrade.com) and Blockchain Application OwnerPhoenix, Arizona, USA

Honeywell has over 1,000 physical "sites" globally that we MANUALLY collect all of the GHG / energy usage data from. 

We would like to leverage our own Blockchain ledger to collect the GHG / energy usage data directly from utility companies. As a test, we are collaborating with local utility companies in Arizona to feed their data directly to the Blockchain. If anyone knows anything about standards in this area, would love to learn more because we're building our own "standards" now (we're not trying to make this complicated). 

NOTE: Honeywell has multiple Blockchain applications running in production - including aerospace part pedigree tracking, anti-counterfeit technologies and digital quality repair and overhaul records. Climate accounting/tracking seems like a perfect use case for Honeywell to get involved with.

HydroLink is a blockchain secured platform for hydrogen certification, supply chain tracking, and carbon credit trading

As Green Hydrogen is predicted to make up for 25% of the energy mix by 2050, Industrial policy and certification is required before Green Hydrogen can successfully trade as renewable energy.

We are building the entire infrastructure needed to certify and trace Hydrogen through the entire value chain, then building a carbon exchange and carbon accounting system.
