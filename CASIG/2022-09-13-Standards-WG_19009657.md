# Climate Action SIG : 2022 09 13 Standards WG

Created by Alex Ivan Howard, last modified on Sep 13, 2022

### Agenda

1. Follow-up from last meeting: Reach out to Martin Wainstein again to find out how they are doing with their "translation".
2. Where do the requirements to fulfil a certain role fit into the ontology? Perhaps somehow related to the "Procedure" class?
3. Incorporate the following aspects about roles into our ontology: they are context-specific; they are sometimes mutually exclusive; a role restricts the set of activities that an agent can perform in the context within which they enact the role; some roles require the enacting agent to have met certain requirements to be allowed to enact the role in that context.
