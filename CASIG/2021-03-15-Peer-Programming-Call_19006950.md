# Climate Action SIG : 2021-03-15 Peer Programming Call

Created by Si Chen, last modified on Mar 15, 2021

Several new people joined the call today, so we had a chance to discuss different development directions:

- The utility emissions channel will be going live in the next two weeks as we work through the final kubernetes deployment issues.
- It can be used with the existing opentaps energy application as the front end.
- Longer term, a mobile app could be developed for consumers to mint tokens for renewable energy generated by their solar panels.
- What will be the criteria for issuing valid carbon offsets for grid-connected solar panels in countries such as India?
- How can we improve Fabric security with OAuth and TrustId
- Contribution opportunities for Earth Day
