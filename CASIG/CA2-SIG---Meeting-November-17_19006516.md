## **Using Open Source to Transform Our Power Grid**

The transition from centralized fossil-fuel generation to renewable and distributed energy resources is the most significant reimagining of power systems in over 140 years.  Approximately, 75% of our planetary carbon emissions can be mitigated through the electrification of energy and transportation. There is no Plan B for grid transformation; the time is now. By adopting an open source strategy that maximizes flexibility, agility, and interoperability, we can learn to innovate at the speed of technology.
