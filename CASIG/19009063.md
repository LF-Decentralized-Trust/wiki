# Climate Action SIG : Stakeholder Analysis Research Project: Supply Chain Decarbonization Project

Created by Woody Moore, last modified on Apr 05, 2022

## Objective

In order for the [Supply Chain Decarbonization Project](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/CASIG/Supply+Chain+Decarbonization+Project) to be successful, we need to understand:

- The pain points that will inform the solution that stakeholders need
- The market dynamics that will inform business model to make this solution sustainable
- The partnerships that can provide us with development/financial support and help lead to market awareness and adoption of the solution.

## Stakeholders

## Research Questions

**Oil and Natural Gas Producers**

- What are the existing pressures (or incentives) for gas flaring decarbonization?
- What additional pressures (incentives) do they anticipate?
- How do they currently track this information?
- What are they currently tracking? (Scope 1, 2 or 3 emissions)?
- What tools are they using?
- What are their existing pain points in tracking these emissions (using the tools that they have available)?
- What is their impression of blockchain? (concerns)?
- What existing initiatives do they have to tackle this challenge? Interest/opportunity to participate with the CA2SIG?

**Investors**

- What are the existing pressures that financial markets are placing on oil/gas companies for oil supply chain decarbonization? (Focus on gas flaring)
- What future pressures are expected?
- What information (carbon emission data) do investors/the market currently use?
- How is this information captured? What tools are used)?
- What are the pain points? (Is this information trustworth costly to gather? accurate? sufficient for the needs of the marketplace?
- In an ideal world, what information would investors like to be available to them?

**Government**

- What are the existing government policies which are incentivizing Oil supply chain decarbonization? (Focus on gas flaring)
- What new policies might be expected and when?

**Solution Providers** (consultants or technology vendors)

- What is the marketplace demand for Scope 3?
- How do you see this evolving?
- Which industries represent the highest growth industries?
- What solutions do you currently provide?
- What are your pain points (what solutions do you need)
- What is the business model?
- Who are your greatest competitors?

**Development Institutions**

- What are the existing pressures (or incentives) for gas flaring decarbonization?
- What additional pressures (incentives) do they anticipate?
- How do they currently track this information?
- What are they currently tracking? (Scope 1, 2 or 3 emissions)?
- What tools are they using?
- What are their existing pain points in tracking these emissions (using the tools that they have available)?
- What is their impression of blockchain? (concerns)?
- What existing initiatives do they have to tackle this challenge? Interest/opportunity to participate with the CA2SIG?
