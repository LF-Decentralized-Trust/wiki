## **Minutes**

- SIG should consider a working group to discuss the high-level solution architecture blueprint for the Climate Action industry. A group who can look at the industry, business processes, applications, data, technologies, project initiatives, associations, stakeholders, etc at the 50k meter / foot level. A group made up of key industry experts to discuss objectives, challenges, open items, project initiatives (legal, business, tech), etc as the industry evolves. In order for the private sector to help they will need to better understand the pain points and how / where they can help. For example, the Mark Carney Scaling Voluntary Markets Taskforce consultation document talks about 17 recommendations. How will the industry coordinate and respond (in both the public and private sectors) to unlock institutional money from financial markets?
