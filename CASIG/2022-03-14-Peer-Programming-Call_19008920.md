# Climate Action SIG : 2022-03-14 Peer Programming Call

Created by Si Chen, last modified on Mar 14, 2022

**Summary**

- Demo carbon tracker token
- How to turn corporate-level methane emissions data into fuel carbon intensity token
- Data gathering for [Oil &amp; Gas Methane Emissions Reduction Project](19008903.html)

**Key Questions**

- If there are multiple data sources with different values, how should we arrive at a final value?
  
  - If it the different auditors perform the same functions with the same methodologies, then it's just a matter of randomly choosing one auditor, having them issue the token.  Later we could make it more elaborate like Chainlink where other auditors could check and challenge the first auditor.
  - If there are very different values, for example from company reported vs. satellite methane flarings, then we an auditor should review the different data sources, come up with a recommendation, and create a DAO proposal.  Then the group as a whole could vote to accept or reject the value from the auditor.  Alternatively, several auditors could come up with different values based on the data sources, and the group could vote on which one to accept.
- How do we attach the company-specific carbon intensity based on methane flaring to fuel purchased by a consumer? 
  
  - Could we calculate the carbon intensity of the base emissions factors, so that the carbon intensity of a specific product could then be a differential against it?
