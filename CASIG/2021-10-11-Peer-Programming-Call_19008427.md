# Climate Action SIG : 2021-10-11 Peer Programming Call

Created by Si Chen, last modified on Oct 14, 2021

**Summary**

- Discuss participating in [Hacktoberfest 2021](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/)
- Plan development of full Scope 1/2/3 emissions calculator, potential applications, and ecosystem
- Review with [Pritam Singh](https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/~Pritam%2012) **-** 
  
  - Deployment of Vault
  - Update documentation

Our plans for upcoming development:

- Extend the emissions calculator to cover full Scope 1/2/3 emissions
- Build an openly available emissions factors data set on OrbitDB.  It will initially be seeded with the US EPA, EU EIA, and UK emissions factors, then expanded over time.
- Develop an ecosystem around it of commercial service providers, open source developers, and companies
- Initially we'll work on
  
  - Cloud computing emissions calculator based on the one from ThoughtWorks
  - Mobile app for calculating travel emissions

These changes are now on github as [issues with the label scope-3-emissions](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/blockchain-carbon-accounting/labels/scope-3-emissions)

Please leave your feedback as comments.
