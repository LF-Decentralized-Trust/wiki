# Climate Action SIG : 2021 10 26 Standards WG

Created by Alex Ivan Howard, last modified on Oct 26, 2021

**Agenda:**

1. Look at Global Reporting Initiative and discuss relevance and possibilities for encoding it into an ontology/schema/RDF vocabulary ([https://www.globalreporting.org/standards/](https://www.globalreporting.org/standards/)).
2. Follow up discussion about the semantic web by looking at the relevance of the [Semantic Sensor Network (SSN) ontology](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-ssn/) specifically for sensors
   
   1. "SSN follows a horizontal and vertical modularization architecture by including a lightweight but self-contained core ontology called SOSA (Sensor, Observation, Sample, and Actuator) for its elementary classes and properties. With their different scope and different degrees of axiomatization, SSN and SOSA are able to support a wide range of applications and use cases, including satellite imagery, large-scale scientific monitoring, industrial and household infrastructures, social sensing, citizen science, observation-driven ontology engineering, and the Web of Things."
3. Follow up on data acquisition request from footprint calculators. 
   
   1. Look at data aquired from [https://www.footprintnetwork.org/licenses/public-data-package-free/](https://www.footprintnetwork.org/licenses/public-data-package-free/)
   2. Methodology at [https://www.footprintnetwork.org/resources/data/](https://www.footprintnetwork.org/resources/data/)
4. Begin discussion on ways to classify states.
   
   1. Do the SDGs provide the framework for a comprehensive list of states?

## **Meeting Notes**

Homework: 

1. Look at the copyright etc. issues for the GRI standards. Are we allowed to create technical (blockchain-suitable data structure) implementations thereof?
