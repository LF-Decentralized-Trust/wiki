# Climate Action SIG : 2020-08-18 Carbon Accounting WG Peer Programming Meeting

Created by Si Chen, last modified on Nov 09, 2020

## Meeting Summary

Tested and got [Robin Klemens](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/5b068694a595df5d0a165a66?ref=confluence)'s [docker-compose-setup](https://github.com/opentaps/blockchain-carbon-accounting/tree/master/utility-emissions-channel/docker-compose-setup) working to set up 3 peers and a utilityemissionschannel.

Talked about Blockchain Explorer, but turns out not many people have used it.  So we'll leave it out for now.

Talked about what language to write chain code in: Go, Node.js, or Typescript.  No final decision on one language yet.

Talked about where to put [seed data](https://github.com/opentaps/blockchain-carbon-accounting/issues/2): OrbitDB, on ledger in CouchDB, separate MongoDB database?

Everybody felt the meeting was helpful, so we're going to try to schedule another one for August 31.  

Meanwhile, a few (non-binding) TODO's:

- [nish](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/70121:1b06d09f-e814-4849-b9c9-1e3ea7b5dbab?ref=confluence) will look into which database option is best for seed data
- [Robin Klemens](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/5b068694a595df5d0a165a66?ref=confluence) will create scripts to deploy chain code to channel
- [Lam Nguyen](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/712020:61b84c88-58c9-4599-a9a5-6da98840b618?ref=confluence) will try writing basic chain code in Go
- [kamlesh nagware](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/557058:8e1fc425-f938-4b39-ad13-9cd8b0ddde52?ref=confluence) will set up a demo with hyperledger sample's fabcar

We're going to try to have a demo ready for the [next OpenClimate Collabathon](https://www.collabathon.openclimate.earth/) in November.
