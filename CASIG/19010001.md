# Climate Action SIG : Identity &amp; Digital Credentials

Created by Bertrand WILLIAMSRIOUX on Jan 16, 2023

The pages outlines ongoing distributed identity solution development for [NET network](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/blockchain-carbon-accounting/tree/main/hardhat).

There are two parts:

1. use of uport-project [ethr-did specification](https://github.com/uport-project/ethr-did) and [ethr-did-registry](https://github.com/uport-project/ethr-did-registry) to link verifiable credentials to roles assigned to users of our contracts.

2\. Include the ethr-did spec as part of the [AnonCreds Methods Registry](https://hyperledger.github.io/anoncreds-methods-registry/), aligning it with the [AnonCreds Specification](https://hyperledger.github.io/anoncreds-spec/#publishing-the-credential-definition-on-a-verifiable-data-registry) for blockchain agnostic identity solutions.

Some background on how we plan on using DIDs and digital credentials as part of the [Operating System for Climate Action](Operating-System-for-Climate-Action_19005889.html):

- A DID framework includes specifications, registries and trusted institutions to establish identities linked to a blockchain wallet (address).
- The specifications (e.g., [AnonCreds](https://hyperledger.github.io/anoncreds-spec/#publishing-the-credential-definition-on-a-verifiable-data-registry)) set guidelines for managing credentials, i.e., define credential publishers, create and publish credential and revocation objects.
- DID methods (e.g., [ethr-did](https://github.com/uport-project/ethr-did)) implement the specifications recognized by an authority (accreditation body) to issue credentials to a wallet.
- Credential objects are published to a registry (e.g. [ether-did-registry](https://github.com/uport-project/ethr-did-registry)) accessible to a smart contract (e.g., NET)

An application using a contract of the operating system calls a did-registry to verify that a wallet owner (public address) has specific credentials. E.g. I am an auditor, credit issuer, company .... )

- trigger the admin to revise (register/unregister) a role based on the status/source of a credential
- allow a non admin user to check the providence of the tokens they are buying/selling, i.e.,  credentials linked to an issuers address (credential authority, issue and revocation date)
- check if a listed industry/consumer has credentials from a trusted source verifying their identity (org name, address, ...)
