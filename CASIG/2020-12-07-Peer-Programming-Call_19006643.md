# Climate Action SIG : 2020-12-07 Peer Programming Call

Created by Si Chen, last modified on Dec 07, 2020

Today Vatsal showed us an integration of [TrustID](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/TrustID/) with the [Emissions Data Channel](Emissions-Data-Channel_19006106.html) (you can see this on the attached video.)  In the demo Vatsal showed how we could create a distributed identifier (DID) with TrustID and then call the Hyperledger Fabric chain code with it.

Before fulling integrating TrustID, however, we should better understand how it should be used – where should the private key of the DID be stored?  How should a client app interact with TrustID?  We would also like to know what the plans of the TrustID development team are going forward.  So we will reach out to the TrustID team and see if they could come to one of our meetings.

Moving on to a deployment of the utility emissions channel, we discussed:

1. Should we deploy using docker swarm or kubernetes?  It was decided we should use kubernetes.  [Robin Klemens](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/5b068694a595df5d0a165a66?ref=confluence)has gotten it to work and will add to the documentation, and then we'll test it.
2. Should the seed data be stored on Amazon DynamoDB?  That would create a centralized data source for a decentralized app.  So we'll look into using OrbitDB.
3. Where should we store backup documentation, like utility bills?  We can currently store it on Amazon S3 (or a local version of it) but will look into how it should be done for a deployment setup, where there are separate nodes, each with their own backup data to store.
4. Client access can be handled, at least for now, with [opentaps](https://github.com/opentaps/opentaps_seas).
