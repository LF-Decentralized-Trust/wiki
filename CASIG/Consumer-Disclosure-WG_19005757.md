# Climate Action SIG : Consumer Disclosure WG

Created by Martin Wainstein, last modified by Si Chen on Apr 20, 2021

# Mission

The consumer disclosure working group looks at ways of making customers aware, in a meaningful, understandable way, of the impact they bring about on the environment while going about their daily life.  This could mean for instance, one's impact caused by :

- the products they choose to buy,
- the modes of travel they choose
- the companies they choose to buy from
- Heating / lighting of their home

The intent is to offer easy information for an individual to be able to see impact / options in order to take informed decisions to take personal action in the reduction of climate impact

As a background the working group continues to build on the good work done by various teams in the [Open Climate Project](https://www.collabathon.openclimate.earth/copy-of-about-abstract). This WG has a relationship of being a [node](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vTt8v-6Jni6fEphPE0iThr7jLTb6s_yJzh4whm1is3YPwdIIoltHj57AZh4t8Ru0RHn41pRVKXK4zrC/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000&slide=id.g6f3ff0410e_2_52) in the Collabathon.

# Example Themes

- Consumer information in E-commerce journeys
- The environmental impact of a supply chains for an end consumer
- Consumer information related to personal mobility
- Mitigation of one's environmental impact
- The role of media in disseminating environment related (dis)information e.g. greenwashing by corporations or portraying products to be green by using green backdrops
- The role of identity in enabling consumer disclosure
