# Climate Action SIG : CSR Reporting WG

Created by Robin Klemens, last modified by Ermanno Camerinelli on Nov 11, 2021

## **Mission**

The mission of this working group is to:

- explore solutions leveraging blockchain to enhance Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Reporting and to mitigate greenwashing
- combine the expertise of Hyperledger's Special Interest Groups
- identify the role of open-source technology in blockchain-based CSR reporting

## **Why now?**

Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is the idea that a business has a responsibility to the society and environment in which it operates (acc. to [Sustainable Business Strategy](https://online.hbs.edu/courses/sustainable-business-strategy/)).  With new developments such as the [EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive](https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/company-reporting-and-auditing/company-reporting/corporate-sustainability-reporting_en) which extends the scope of CSR reporting and requires the audit of reported information, corporations must seek new ways to capture and share trusted information about their impact. There is a growing demand for CSR reporting and the current state of the art needs to change to address the following stakeholders needs:

**People**

- "more than 9-in-10 millennials would switch brands to one associated with a cause" - [2015 Cone Communications Millennial CSR Study](https://www.conecomm.com/research-blog/2015-cone-communications-millennial-csr-study)
- "prepared to make personal sacrifices to make an impact on issues they care about, whether that’s paying more for a product, sharing products rather than buying, or taking a pay cut to work for a responsible company" - [2015 Cone Communications Millennial CSR Study](https://www.conecomm.com/research-blog/2015-cone-communications-millennial-csr-study)

**Investors**

- ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) investing grew to more than $30 trillion in 2018, and some estimates say it could reach $50 trillion over the next two decades ([Source](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/14/your-complete-guide-to-socially-responsible-investing.html))
- “Our conviction is that companies perform better when they are deliberate about their role in society and act in the interests of their employees, customers, communities and their shareholders.” — [BlackRock, 2021](https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2021/03/22/blackrocks-2021-engagement-priorities/)
- According to the second annual [Corporate Social Responsibility Survey from Aflac, FleishmanHillard Research, and Lightspeed GMI](https://www.aflac.com/about-aflac/corporate-citizenship/default.aspx?utm_medium=multiple&utm_source=vanity&utm_campaign=corpcomm_2015&utm_term=acsr), more than 80 percent of professional investors prefer to invest i a company known for its social responsibility

**Corporations**:

- Being a socially responsible company can bolster a company's image and build its brand.
- Social responsibility empowers employees to leverage the corporate resources at their disposal to do good.
- Formal corporate social responsibility programs can boost employee morale and lead to greater productivity in the workforce.
- Better access to finance when environmental, social, and governance considerations are incorporated into external reporting

**Governments: !!!**

On 21 April 2021, the Commission adopted a [proposal for a Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD)](https://ec.europa.eu/info/publications/210421-sustainable-finance-communication_en#csrd), which would amend the existing reporting requirements of the NFRD. The proposal

- extends the scope to all large companies and all companies listed on regulated markets (except listed micro-enterprises)
- requires the audit (assurance) of reported information
- introduces more detailed reporting requirements, and a requirement to report according to mandatory EU sustainability reporting standards
- requires companies to digitally ‘tag’ the reported information, so it is machine readable and feeds into the European single access point envisaged in the [capital markets union action plan](https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/growth-and-investment/capital-markets-union/capital-markets-union-2020-action-plan_en)
