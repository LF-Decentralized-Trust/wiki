# Climate Action SIG : CA2 SIG Standards WG Call

Created by Woody Moore, last modified by Alex Ivan Howard on Jan 29, 2024

The biweekly Standards WG workshop will carry out the work plan as set out in [this](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1luI_bR3RdXP9EBxsQ58PQMdRKwREkvwm/view?usp=sharing) document.

This involves four phases:  
A. Conceptualisation of a DLT-enabled standardisation architecture to streamline Climate Action &amp; Accounting.  
B. Implementing the result of phase A in three different paradigms: as a relational database, as a Radix-Merkle tree (as is used by Hyperledger Sawtooth), and as a token-and-smart-contract network (possibly DAML).  
C. Testing applicability to real-life use cases.  
D. Reviewing the results from phase C and revisiting phases A-C as necessary.

Anyone is welcome to join, but we are specifically looking for individuals interested in the fundamentals of climate accounting and climate-related MRV, or individuals who seek to develop or contribute skills in DLT networks and/or relational database design within the context of climate action and accounting.

Join the bi-weekly CA2SIG Standards WG call held the first and third Tuesday each month at 8 AM US Pacific time (UTC-07:00 America/Los Angeles.) Please [check the calendar for the next call](https://lists.hyperledger.org/g/climate-sig/calendar)[.](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/CASIG/Meetings)
