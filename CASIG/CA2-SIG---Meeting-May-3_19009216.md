- Technical support wanted for the technical translation of schemas
  
  - protobuf to JSON
  - protobuf to JSON-LD

  - Technical contributors are welcome! Please reach out to [Woody Moore](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/70121:310f5eae-a11b-435a-ae52-42b0a796fe0b?ref=confluence), [Si Chen](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/557058:c49c10c4-25bf-4187-b582-b521c3c33223?ref=confluence), or [Bertrand WILLIAMSRIOUX](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/712020:57613290-3ad4-4f53-8166-19a9bdb9c047?ref=confluence)if you want to get involved
  - Non-technical contributors can support in conducting a market analysis of the supply chain in the oil &amp; gas, cement, and steel industry to identify the key players and tools used
- Electrodo questions:
  
  - To solve the problem of "End-to-end traceability" of various assets of the enterprise that participate in the value chain, we consider the possibility of using the UTXO model, instead of "balance based". Our goal is to be able to verify the attributes of a virtual asset (tokenized value) at any time, especially in terms of its origin, change of ownership, and the need to avoid the problem of "double counting". Is it okay to use UTXO model for this kind of issues specially where "various assets" could be token with energy generation data, and it could be token with carbon emission's data and so on.
  - Is it a good idea to store data that is transmitted in text format in a blockchain, and images and media information in the database while providing a link to them with a hash in the token?
    
    - How can you ensure the reliability of data when storing documents off chain (store a hash in the blockchain of this document), is this mechanism enough to ensure trust?
  - Data tokenization process - when Fabric Token SDK will be available?
