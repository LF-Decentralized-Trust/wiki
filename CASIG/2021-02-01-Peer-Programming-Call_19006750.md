# Climate Action SIG : 2021-02-01 Peer Programming Call

Created by Si Chen, last modified on Feb 01, 2021

Today turned out to be a real peer programming call!

We were trying to debug why the invokeChaincode.sh script was not storing the utility emissions factors correctly on the chain.  The first problem was that it needed to be run on both peers to store data.  Then after the call we figured out the problem was that it needed to reference the peers and orderers as localhost instead of their docker names such as peer1.auditor1.carbonAccounting.com, peer1.auditor2.carbonAccounting.com, etc. 

We fixed it and were able to get the emissions factors to store on the ledger and see them in couchdb!
