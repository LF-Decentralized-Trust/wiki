# Climate Action SIG : Engagement WG

Created by Woody Moore, last modified on May 24, 2023

The goal of this working group is to help the members of the CA2SIG align their activities to help build awareness about Climate Accounting in general, grow membership of the Climate Action and Accounting Special Interest Group, and improve the capacity of the group through education, networking, and attracting members with different areas of needed subject matter expertise.

To accomplish this, the Engagement Working Group will support several different projects areas:

- Events and Speaking Engagements Project
- Articles / Media Strategy Project
- Speaker Series Planning Project
- Published Papers by CA2SIG members

Please visit the Climate Action and Accounting [Resources Page](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/CASIG/Resources) for past recordings, articles, and published papers.
