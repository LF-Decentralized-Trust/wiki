  - Climate Research WG 
    
    - Voluntary Carbon Offsets Directory Research Project Update - Can SIG members help us with outreach?
      
      - Next step: Interview stakeholders

- [lussher](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/639ebea5030d706ab0e1be7e?ref=confluence)presented a project she is currently working on with students. The goal is to build an App that enables personal carbon accounting with features like a barcode scanner that calculates the carbon footprint of a product (e.g banana) and accounts for the emission into a personal carbon budget
- Open discussion: How can blockchain help companies with better CSR goal reporting? -a question that came up at the Hyperledger Global Forum
  
  - Use blockchain to cover all SDG (general purpose vs. carbon only)
  - [Woody Moore](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/70121:310f5eae-a11b-435a-ae52-42b0a796fe0b?ref=confluence) and [Robin Klemens](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/5b068694a595df5d0a165a66?ref=confluence) want to build a business case for blockchain-enabled CSR reporting and create a project page on the wiki
    
    - Hypothesis: A blockchain-based system for CSR reporting allows corporations to save money and increases corporations attractiveness to their customers (soft facts)
  - [Alex Ar](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/70121:ff131248-c3c4-487f-be47-ba4066c5e1a3?ref=confluence)offered to provide some information about CSR reporting (e.g. power usage for data centers)
- Open discussion: diversity and inclusion project.
  
  - General agreement that the best way to improve diversity is by providing opportunity for diverse stakeholders to work on projects that can provide experience that can improve professional development.
  - Strong opportunity to leverage CSR Reporting project to enable community members to take on projects with companies (especially around the development of smart contracts for all of the MRV work that will be included).
