# Climate Action SIG : 2022-05-23 Peer Programming Call

Created by Si Chen, last modified on May 23, 2022

**Summary**

- Discussed the new CarbonTracker token and how it can be used to track emissions down the supply chain:
  
  - an Auditor will issue an audited emissions certificate to a company
  - the CarbonTracker will link multiple products to the audited emissions certificate
  - the product certificates could then be issued to customers (or any other supply chain partner)
  - the product certificates could be used instead of emissions factors for their emissions audits
- Changes to the application planned:
  
  - Remove the industry dealer role
  - The contract owner will grant the industry role
  - Industry role means a party who could take emisisons audits and issue product certificates based on their output
  - Industry would request the carbon tracker product certificates to be issued
  - Auditor would issue the product certificates for the industry
