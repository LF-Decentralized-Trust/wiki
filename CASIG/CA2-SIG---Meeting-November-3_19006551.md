## **Minutes**

- General introductions from attendees
- [Martin Wainstein](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/5af98bd1e608115790242590?ref=confluence) reviewed the  opportunity at hand to establish a cross-working group, and cross-sig approach in the context of the [Open Climate Collabathon](https://www.collabathon.openclimate.earth/)
  
  - Provided context from the last [peer programing s](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/CASIG/Carbon+Accounting+WG+Peer+Programming+Call+2020-10-26)ession on Multi-Channel Data Architecture which segway into a common Open Business Application Network.
  - This project proposal and Hyperledger Working group is now posted on a [Collabathon page for the Hyperledger community](https://collabathon-docs.openclimate.earth/prompts-1/2020-working-groups/hyperledger-working-group) to engage with:
    
    - It include a high-level and generic framework (the Open Business Application Network) and,
    - A specific use-case on [securitized solar financing](https://collabathon-docs.openclimate.earth/prompts-1/2020-working-groups/hyperledger-working-group/solar-financing-app-interoperability) that can be the hub for code contributions and common efforts. 
      
      - The solar use case leverages the [Orange Button Data Taxonomy](https://orangebutton.io/), an application called the [Originator Engine](https://oe.raisegreen.com/) from Raise Green (a Finra portal for crowd investment), the [OpenTaps](https://opentaps.org/) application environment, and the [OpenSolar](https://www.demo.openx.solar/) application (access: demodemo.
- Attendees gave good feedback and encouragement to the initiative and propose the definition of next steps and effort
- Next steps (for everyone to contribute):
  
  - Establish a clear map of how every HL WG and SIG can plug into the project
  - Provide clear contributions opportunities
  - Reach out to the main communities to invite them to the session on [Emission Accounting on November 10 at 9am PST](https://www.collabathon.openclimate.earth/open-climate-dialogues-nov2020)
