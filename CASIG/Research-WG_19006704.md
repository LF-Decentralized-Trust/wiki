# Climate Action SIG : Research WG

Created by Lam Nguyen, last modified by Woody Moore on May 24, 2023

# **Mission**

The focus of the Climate Research Working Group (CRWG) is to promote mutual understanding, collaborative activities, and interdisciplinary climate action through research. Therefore, we have decided to open a new Research Working Group to focus on studying DLT applications while targeting climate actions.

# **Scope**

The current scope of Climate Research Working Group includes: 

1. Working on ideas, proof of concepts, use cases and functional architectures of DLT's
2. Connecting academia to industrial towards building a Climate Research Consortium.
3. Sharing stories of successes, opportunities and challenges;
4. Promoting products and open sources of SIG
5. Writing research papers to submit to good places (Hyperledger Research, peer-review journals, conferences)
