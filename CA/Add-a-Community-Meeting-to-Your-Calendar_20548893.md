# Community Architects : Add a Community Meeting to Your Calendar

Created by Karen Ottoni, last modified on Apr 28, 2020

There are two ways to add our community meetings to your personal calendar

## Option 1: Start from the Hyperledger Wiki &amp; Use for google calendars and Desktop Calendar (Outlook, iCal)

1. Visit the Hyperledger [Calendar of Public Meetings](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/HYP/pages/19595324/Calendar+of+Public+Meetings)
2. Find the next relevant community meeting you would like to attend and add to your calendar, click on it and you will see a link “copy to my calendar”
3. Click on that link and it will open a separate window or download the invite
4. NOTE: it will only download/add that one occurrence, if you would like it to repeat regularly, you must select "repeats biweekly", for example, and then hit save.

## Option 2: Start from groups.io &amp; Use for Desktop Calendars

1. Visit Hyperledger's Groups [https://lists.hyperledger.org/groups](https://lists.hyperledger.org/groups)
2. Find your community group in the list (note there are multiple pages). *For example*, [https://lists.hyperledger.org/g/capital-markets-sig](https://lists.hyperledger.org/g/capital-markets-sig)
3. Find "Calendar" within the group as the last item in the side bar on the left [https://lists.hyperledger.org/g/capital-markets-sig/calendar](https://lists.hyperledger.org/g/capital-markets-sig/calendar)
4. Scroll to the bottom of the calendar and click on button "Subscribe to Calendar"
5. A window will pop-up with a link you can paste in your browser [https://lists.hyperledger.org/g/capital-markets-sig/ics/4075450/1068246974/feed.ics](https://lists.hyperledger.org/g/capital-markets-sig/ics/4075450/1068246974/feed.ics), which prompt a download of the calendar invite
6. NOTE: Make sure to check the cadence of the group's meetings as the download *may* be just for that occurrence and not a recurring invite, in which case you will need to select the cadence and then save
