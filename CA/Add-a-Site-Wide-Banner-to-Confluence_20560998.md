Created by David Huseby on Mar 07, 2019

This article covers how to add a site-wide banner to the top of every page on this wiki.

## Step-by-step guide

To change the banner do the following:

1. Log into Confluence with an admin account.
2. Click the gear icon in the upper right of the page and select "General configuration".
3. Scroll down to the "LOOK AND FEEL" section on the left and click on "Custom HTML".
4. Click the "Edit" button and add the banner to the text box labeled "At beginning of the BODY".
5. Click the "Save" button.

Â 

Here is the HTML used for the banner to gather attention for the internship program:

&lt;div class="aui-message closeable"&gt;  
&lt;p class="title"&gt;  
&lt;strong&gt;Get Involved! Become a mentor for an intern&lt;/strong&gt;  
&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;Call for 2019 internship projects is currently open. &lt;a href="[https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/INTERN/Hyperledger+Internship+Program"&gt;Propose]() a New Internship Project&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;/div&gt;
