# Community Architects : Rename Capital markets SIG to Financial Markets SIG.

Created by Ry Jones, last modified by Karen Ottoni on Jul 18, 2022

We had announced that the name of the Capital markets SIG will be changed to Financial Markets SIG. We had also put it before the community for comments.  
These are the touchpoints for the name change (in my estimation)

- The landing wiki page and its children
- The logo [Karen Ottoni](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/712020:b91a9879-c835-4217-a2e7-e13c7e529f5b?ref=confluence)
- The email lists
- The name of the group on linkedin [Karen Ottoni](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/people/712020:b91a9879-c835-4217-a2e7-e13c7e529f5b?ref=confluence)
- Maybe the youtube keywords.
- The charter and the scope.

Please let me know how I can help with this.
