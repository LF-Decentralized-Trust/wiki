- Add this wiki space to the "Groups" menu under SIG (see [HOWTO Modify Top-Level Menu](https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/tools/Modify+Top-Level+Menu)). Note: List is alphabetical.

Ecosystem Tasks:

- Type your task here, using "@" to assign to a user and "//" to select a due date
- Make sure the SIG Chair has an LFID and has logged into lists.hyperledger.org at least once. (This is necessary to set them up on the mailing list).
- Make sure the SIG Chair has logged into chat.hyperledger.org at least once and tell the CA team the username they use. (This is necessary for setting up the chat channel).  Hyperledger now uses Discord for chat: [https://discord.gg/hyperledger](https://discord.gg/hyperledger)
- Tell the CA team who is the SIG Chair and their email so they can add them to the mailing list
