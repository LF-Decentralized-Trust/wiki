# Community Architects : Mailing Lists

Created by Tracy Kuhrt, last modified on Jan 10, 2019

This document covers best practices surrounding the type of mailing lists and roles for each type. Today, we have the following type of chat channels (seeÂ [mailing list mapping](Mailing-Lists_20545702.html)):

- Project lists (e.g., fabric, sawtooth)
- Working Group lists (e.g., architecture-wg, identity-wg)
- Special Interest Group lists (e.g., social-impact-sig, healthcare-sig)
- Program lists (e.g., meetup, ambassador)
- Member-only lists (restricted to members)
- General lists (e.g., main, discuss, lab)

Other types of lists will be at the discretion of the Community Architects.

# #hashtags

#hashtags should be used to segregate the discussions that are happening within a mailing list. #hashtags allow for people to specify whether they wish to see mail related to those particular #hashtags, as well as, use the Web UI to only look at the subset of messages related to the #hashtag.
