# Community Architects : Add Moderator and/or Owner to Mailing List

Created by Tracy Kuhrt, last modified by Ry Jones on Feb 03, 2020

This HOWTO explains how you would add a moderator and/or an owner to a mailing list on the [Hyperledger groups.io](https://lists.hyperledger.org/) instance. This HOWTO is necessary for setting up new projects and new working groups.

## Prerequisites

1. You must be an Owner on the [Hyperledger mailing lists](https://lists.hyperledger.org/).
2. The person that you are adding must have already subscribed to the [main list](https://lists.hyperledger.org/g/main).

## Step-by-step guide

1. Search to see if the person that you want to add is already a member of the mailing list. You can do this using the search field under "Admin | Direct Add". If the person shows up in the search, they are not a member of the mailing list yet
2. If the person is not already a member of the mailing list, you must add them
   
   1. Click the checkbox next to their name/email address in the search results from step #1
   2. Click the "Add Members" button
3. Click the person in the list's member directory under "Admin | Members". NOTE: They should appear at the top of the list, but you can search for them as necessary
4. Change the "Role" to reflect whether they are a "Moderator" or an "Owner"
5. For Owners and Moderators, use the following notification settings:
