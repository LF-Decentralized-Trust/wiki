# Community Architects : Grid - Completed

Created by Silona Bonewald, last modified on Apr 25, 2019

- Set up chat channel named #{project-name} (see [HOWTO Create a Chat Channel](https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/tools/Create+a+Chat+Channel))
- Set up mailing list named `{project-name}@hyperledger.org` (see [HOWTO Create a Mailing List](https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/tools/Create+a+Mailing+List) and [HOWTO Add Moderator and/or Owner to Mailing List](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=20548258))
- Set up Jira project
- Set up Wiki space using project space (To be created in the meantime use the [Sample Project Page](https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/tools/Sample+Project+Page) as the home page in a blank space). Name the space `projectname` all lower case. Label the page with `project-home` so that it shows up on the main page and project page automatically
  
  - Configure the sidebar on the space and remove the "Pages", "Blog", and "Space Shortcuts" sections by clicking on the \`-\` sign next to them until they appear as a \`+\` sign. Then save the changes.
  - Edit the space permissions to provide View rights (and only view rights) to anonymous users.
- Add the Wiki space to the "Projects" menu (see [HOWTO Modify Top-Level Menu](https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/tools/Modify+Top-Level+Menu))
- Work with the project maintainers to determine how source control will be handled and what repositories are needed
- Set up Github or Gerrit repositories by filing a helpdesk ticket (helpdesk@[hyperledger.org](http://hyperledger.org))
- Create an event on the [TSC calendar](https://lists.hyperledger.org/g/tsc/calendar) for the first quarterly update (see [example](https://lists.hyperledger.org/g/tsc/addevent?eventid=352412&repeatid=0&calstart=2018-12-06)). We normally skip at least one quarter before requiring them to do their first update. That gives them time to get things up and running
- Create an event on the new working group's calendar to remind the subscribers that their TSC update is due (see [example](https://lists.hyperledger.org/g/explorer/addevent?eventid=352423&repeatid=0&calstart=2018-12-06))
- Work with the marketing team to develop a project-specific webpage (see [example](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1T3GcfzLXY1PNi6sgXpPDufWlpqGzIFHjg4ejdoVnVbE/edit))
- Work with the creative services team to create a project-specific logo (file Jira ticket similar to this [example](https://jira.linuxfoundation.org/browse/LP-4327))
- Work with PR team to create a blog post
- Send out [welcome email](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VKLiow7dnWzDC2ePv4b2lYG_WssGetMZX3Temv3PkxA/edit) to the maintainers
