**Who we are:**

We have specialties but we overlap and we all work together on the basics.

**What we do:**

We're here to help the community members involved in Hyperledger's Projects, Working Groups and Labs collaborate with others to get things done.  If you have thoughts about what can be done to make collaboration easier or more effective, we're happy to hear your ideas.

**Who we aren't:**

We are not subject matter experts on all the projects.  it is best to engage the Project's maintainers or the WG or SIG chairs if you have a specific question.  The best places to do this are [chat.hyperledger.org](https://chat.hyperledger.org/) or [lists.hyperledger.org](https://lists.hyperledger.org/groups).  The [projects](https://wiki.hyperledger.org/#Hyperledger-Projects), [Special Interest Groups](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/HYP/Special+Interest+Groups) and [Working Groups](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/HYP/Working+Groups) have wiki pages that you can comment on also.

We are also not tech support on the projects themselves.  Again you need to engage with the projects on chat or email or Github issues.  You can also check their wiki pages for the best ways to engage with them -- some groups prefer chat while others prefer email or bug reports.
