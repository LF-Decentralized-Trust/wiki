# Community Architects : Merging Projects Checklist

Created by Ry Jones on Oct 06, 2022

- Set up appointment with Marketing team to devise Name and Logo
- Set up chat channel named #{project-name} (see [Create a Discord Chat Category and Channels](Create-a-Discord-Chat-Category-and-Channels_20548244.html))
- Set up mailing list named `{project-name}@lists.hyperledger.org` (see [Create a Mailing List](Create-a-Mailing-List_20548248.html) and [Add Moderator and/or Owner to Mailing List](20548258.html))
- Set up Wiki space using project space (To be created in the meantime use the [Sample Project Page](/wiki/pages/createpage.action?spaceKey=CA&title=Sample%20Project%20Page&linkCreation=true&fromPageId=20549286) as the home page in a blank space). Name the space `projectname` all lower case.
  
  - Label the page with `project-home` so that it shows up on the main page and project page automatically
  - Configure the sidebar on the space and remove the "Pages", "Blog", and "Space Shortcuts" sections by clicking on the \`-\` sign next to them until they appear as a \`+\` sign. Then save the changes.
  - Edit the [Set Space Permissions for Anon to read only](Set-Space-Permissions-for-Anon-to-read-only_20548529.html) (and only view rights) to anonymous users.
- Add the Wiki space to the "Projects" menu (see [Modify Top-Level Menu](Modify-Top-Level-Menu_20548266.html))
- Work with the project maintainers to determine how source control will be handled and what repositories are needed
- Set up Github repositories
  
  - Should have settings file; [here's an example](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/main/.github/settings.yml)
  - Must comply with [common repo structure](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/TSC/Common+Repo+structure) (You have two quarters to comply, but it's easier to do up front)
    
    - Please note the repolinter section is in flux right now
- Make sure DCO is turned on
- Make sure Maintainers sign off on NEVER TURNING OFF DCO
- License Scan
- DCO Scan
- Is a security audit needed?
- Create an event on the [TSC calendar](https://lists.hyperledger.org/g/tsc/calendar) for the first quarterly update (see [example](https://lists.hyperledger.org/g/tsc/addevent?eventid=352412&repeatid=0&calstart=2018-12-06)). We normally skip at least one quarter before requiring them to do their first update. That gives them time to get things up and running
- Create an event on the new working group's calendar to remind the subscribers that their TSC update is due (see [example](https://lists.hyperledger.org/g/explorer/addevent?eventid=352423&repeatid=0&calstart=2018-12-06))
- Create a recurring event on the project's calendar for public calls
- Work with the marketing team to develop a project-specific webpage (see [example](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1T3GcfzLXY1PNi6sgXpPDufWlpqGzIFHjg4ejdoVnVbE/edit))
- Work with the creative services team to create a project-specific logo (file Jira ticket similar to this [example](https://jira.linuxfoundation.org/browse/LP-4327), minimum two weeks in advance)
- Work with [pr@hyperledger.org](mailto:pr@hyperledger.org) to create a blog post (minimum two weeks in advance)
- Work with [marketing@hyperledger.org](mailto:marketing@hyperledger.org) on web assets:
  
  - Banner for homepage and greenhouse graphic tagline (if applicable)
  - Short description for Hyperledger projects landing page /projects
  - Extended description for dedicated project page
  - All currently available getting started resource pointers for the project page, i.e., Wiki, Github, WG, Chat, mailing list, video playlists
- Add project maintainers to the [maintainers list](https://lists.hyperledger.org/g/maintainers) and send an introduction message welcoming them to the list
- Send out [welcome email](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VKLiow7dnWzDC2ePv4b2lYG_WssGetMZX3Temv3PkxA/edit) to the maintainers and invite them to an onboarding call and to the new maintainer orientation call
- Two months after welcome email is sent follow up with maintainers if they have not yet scheduled an onboarding call to see how things are going and if they need help
- Add to [FAQ page](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/HYP/FAQ)
- Add to [Video Checklist](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/VID/Videos)
