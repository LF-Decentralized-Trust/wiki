# Community Architects : Community Metrics from lists.hyperledger.org

Created by David Huseby on Jan 29, 2020

The CommunityBridge platform under construction at the Linux Foundation has a new metrics dashboard coming together. We have been asked to come up with metrics we'd like to see included from the Hyperledger community. One area we haven't thought much about is engagement metrics from our mailing lists. This page is the right place to comment/add metrics ideas for the new dashboard. Below are some initial ideas, feel free to add others and/or comment.

## Metrics Ideas

- Measure the volume of contributions of individuals so that the dashboard can show if there are just a few contributors generating most of the posts or if it is more broad based with many individuals contributing. This is a measure of general excitement.
- Measure the volume of contributions of companies and organizations for the same reasons as above.
