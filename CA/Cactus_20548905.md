Created by Ry Jones, last modified on May 27, 2020

- Set up appointment with Marketing team to devise Name and Logo
- Set up chat channel named #{project-name} (see [Create a Discord Chat Category and Channels](Create-a-Discord-Chat-Category-and-Channels_20548244.html))
- Set up mailing list named `{project-name}@lists.hyperledger.org` (see [Create a Mailing List](Create-a-Mailing-List_20548248.html) and [Add Moderator and/or Owner to Mailing List](20548258.html))
- Set up Jira project
  
  - They're using GitHub Issues
- Set up Wiki space using project space (To be created in the meantime use the [Sample Project Page](/wiki/pages/createpage.action?spaceKey=CA&title=Sample%20Project%20Page&linkCreation=true&fromPageId=20548905) as the home page in a blank space). Name the space `projectname` all lower case.
  
  - Label the page with `project-home` so that it shows up on the main page and project page automatically
  - Configure the sidebar on the space and remove the "Pages", "Blog", and "Space Shortcuts" sections by clicking on the \`-\` sign next to them until they appear as a \`+\` sign. Then save the changes.
  - Edit the [Set Space Permissions for Anon to read only](Set-Space-Permissions-for-Anon-to-read-only_20548529.html) (and only view rights) to anonymous users.
- Add the Wiki space to the "Projects" menu (see [Modify Top-Level Menu](Modify-Top-Level-Menu_20548266.html))
- Work with the project maintainers to determine how source control will be handled and what repositories are needed

That gives them time to get things up and running
