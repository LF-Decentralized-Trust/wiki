# Community Architects : Aries New Project Checklist

Created by Silona Bonewald, last modified by Loveneet Singh on Aug 21, 2020

- Set up chat channel named #{project-name} (see [HOWTO Create a Chat Channel](#)) [https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/aries](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/aries)
- Set up mailing list named `{project-name}@hyperledger.org` (see [HOWTO Create a Mailing List](#) and [HOWTO Add Moderator and/or Owner to Mailing List](#))
- Set up Jira project [https://jira.hyperledger.org/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?projectKey=ARIES&amp;rapidView=231&amp;view=planning.nodetail](https://jira.hyperledger.org/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?projectKey=ARIES&rapidView=231&view=planning.nodetail)
- Set up Wiki space using project space (To be created in the meantime use the [Sample Project Page](#) as the home page in a blank space). Name the space `projectname` all lower case. Label the page with `project-home` so that it shows up on the main page and project page automatically [https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/ARIES/Hyperledger+Aries](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/ARIES/Hyperledger+Aries)
  
  - Configure the sidebar on the space and remove the "Pages", "Blog", and "Space Shortcuts" sections by clicking on the \`-\` sign next to them until they appear as a \`+\` sign. Then save the changes.
  - Edit the [space permissions to provide View rights](#) (and only view rights) to anonymous users.
- Add the Wiki space to the "Projects" menu (see [HOWTO Modify Top-Level Menu](#))
- Work with the project maintainers to determine how source control will be handled and what repositories are needed
- Set up Github or Gerrit repositories by filing a helpdesk ticket (helpdesk@hyperledger.org)
- Make sure DCO is turned on
- Make sure Maintainers sign off on NEVER TURNING OFF DCO
- Create an event on the [TSC calendar](https://lists.hyperledger.org/g/tsc/calendar) for the first quarterly update (see [example](https://lists.hyperledger.org/g/tsc/addevent?eventid=352412&repeatid=0&calstart=2018-12-06)). We normally skip at least one quarter before requiring them to do their first update. That gives them time to get things up and running
- Create an event on the new working group's calendar to remind the subscribers that their TSC update is due (see [example](https://lists.hyperledger.org/g/explorer/addevent?eventid=352423&repeatid=0&calstart=2018-12-06))
- Work with the marketing team to develop a project-specific webpage (see [example](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1T3GcfzLXY1PNi6sgXpPDufWlpqGzIFHjg4ejdoVnVbE/edit))
- Work with the creative services team to create a project-specific logo (file Jira ticket similar to this [example](https://jira.linuxfoundation.org/browse/LP-4327))
- Work with PR team to create a blog post
- Send out [welcome email](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VKLiow7dnWzDC2ePv4b2lYG_WssGetMZX3Temv3PkxA/edit) to the maintainers
