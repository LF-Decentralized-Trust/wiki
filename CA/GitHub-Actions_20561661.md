# Community Architects : GitHub Actions

Created by Ry Jones, last modified on Dec 06, 2022

> I was looking for a wiki page outlining the overall GHA migration plan, cost assumptions, and adoption reasoning. I couldn't find a singular reference point and was hoping you all could share the context.

Reasoning:

- CircleCI is opaque for community members
- CircleCI is expensive
- GitHub Actions are more portable
- Having projects on one CI platform will spread expertise

Cost:

- Renting two mac minis at MacStadium (one intel, one arm) is ~$500 a month and supports all projects on GHA
- CircleCI is ~$2300 a month for one project
