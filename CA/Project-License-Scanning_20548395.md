# Community Architects : Project License Scanning

Created by Tracy Kuhrt, last modified on Feb 05, 2019

On a monthly basis, we scan the project source code to ensure that it conforms to the license requirements specified in the [Hyperledger Charter](https://hyperledger.org/about/charter). This how-to article will provide the information necessary to conduct this process.

## Prerequisites

1. You have access to the scripts located at: [https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/hyperledger-community-management-tools/tree/master/create\_tarballs](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/hyperledger-community-management-tools/tree/master/create_tarballs)
2. You can run a bash shell script

## Step-by-step guide

1. Verify that the [repositories.sh](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/hyperledger-community-management-tools/blob/master/common/repositories.sh) file contains the latest list of repositories for each of the projects. If not, modify to reflect the latest list of repositories
2. For each project, run `./create_tarballs.sh --<project-name>`
   
   ```
   for i in burrow caliper cello composer explorer fabric grid indy iroha quilt sawtooth ursa; do
./create_tarballs.sh --$i
done
   ```
3. Copy the `*.tar.gz` files located in `/tmp/<date>/tarballs` to a subdirectory named `<yyyy-mm-dd>/tarballs` under the [Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B_NJV6eJXAA1M1RUMmdNSFRNbWs) to share with Steve Winslow.
4. Copy the results provided by Steve to a subdirectory named `<yyyy-mm-dd>/results` (where &lt;yyyy-mm-dd&gt; matches that used in step #4) under the [Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B_NJV6eJXAA1M1RUMmdNSFRNbWs).
5. Create a bug for each project that has license scan issues and copy the results to that bug.
