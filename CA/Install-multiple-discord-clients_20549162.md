# Community Architects : Install multiple discord clients

Created by Ry Jones on Mar 16, 2022

If you have a pre-existing Discord account and don't want to use it with Hyperledger Discord, installing one of the test clients or using the browser client will help.

## Step-by-step guide

1. Visit the [Discord test client webpage](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360035675191-Discord-Testing-Clients)
2. Install one of the test clients - Canary or PTB.
3. These use distinct credential stores, so you will be able to log in and create a [Hyperledger-only](https://discord.gg/hyperledger) account.
4. If you are a developer, [please link github to your discord profile.](Link-GitHub-to-Discord_20549156.html)
