  Hi Ry, I'm trying to find out whether someone with the appropriate authority (which isn't me!) would be able to publish something (releases) from artifactory to maven central- specifically [https://hyperledger.jfrog.io/ui/packages/gav://org.hyperledger.fabric:fabric-gateway?name=fabric-gateway&amp;type=packages](https://hyperledger.jfrog.io/ui/packages/gav:%2F%2Forg.hyperledger.fabric:fabric-gateway?name=fabric-gateway&type=packages) - do you know if that's possible?

  Also Daniela mentioned about updating hyperledger wikis to add dynamic views, and it would be interesting to do that for fabric pages. Is that something you could help with/talk about on a fabric call some time?

Grid and Iroha need a policy about CI costs
