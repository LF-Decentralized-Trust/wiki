# Community Architects : Security and Health

Created by Ry Jones, last modified on Jan 11, 2022

Security:

- Our [H1 program](https://hackerone.com/hyperledger/?type=team) is here.
- The TSC has created a task for around my proposal
- [Hyperledger Security Task Force - Task Forces - Hyperledger Foundation](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/TF/Hyperledger+Security+Task+Force)
  
  - [Gaps between guidance and implementation for CSVD - Task Forces - Hyperledger Foundation](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/TF/Gaps+between+guidance+and+implementation+for+CSVD)
- OKR
  
  - 2 parts
    
    - 1 define SLA (sorta have,\_) and meet it
      
      - when we get a security report, day-3 to acknowledge, x days to treat
      - we dont control it
      - assign a report to a team, who knows how long to close
      - meet our SLAs - assign, triage
    - 2 work with community to define SECURITY at HL
      
      - Security task force - their job

Health:

- A run of [CHT is here](https://ryjones.github.io/stuffandthings/)
  
  - [CHT code here](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/hyperledger-community-management-tools/tree/main/project-reports)

Release process:

We should not dictate but should have an outline or "best practice" doc - documented release process, way to handle out of cycle releases (security patch, hotfix, etc.), process. 

TSC-approved release process

to move from Inc to Grad - must have, agreed by maintainers and detailed (not approved by TSC?)
