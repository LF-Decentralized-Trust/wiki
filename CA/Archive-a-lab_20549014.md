# Community Architects : Archive a lab

Created by Ry Jones, last modified on Jun 29, 2021

In the course of events, it may be that a lab needs to be archived. This is a mechanical list of how to do so - the political process is outside the scope.

## Step-by-step guide

1. Submit a PR moving the lab's proposal to the archived folder. [Here is an example](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/hyperledger-labs.github.io/pull/151/files).
2. Once approved and merged, you will need to set the lab to archived in GitHub. This is on the settings page at the bottom.
   
   1. This can also be done by editing the \`settings.yml\` file in the repo.
