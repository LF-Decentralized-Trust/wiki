# BootcampHK (archived) : Sessions

Created by Silona Bonewald, last modified by david liu on Mar 10, 2019

Leaders!  Please sign up here to lead a breakout session or tutorial.  You can obviously take up multiple hours in the same room.  The team may have to do cleanup work at some time if there is too much room switching.  Don't take anyone's time slot except for my dummy ones!

Remember! You can do things like work on documentation, fix a bug, create Use Cases, etc it is up to you in regards to what the Project, Work Group or Labs needs.  Just remember often you will be recruiting from people that are new to Hyperledger.  Some will be experienced developers, some will be new devs, some will be writers and some will be designers.  The more complete the breakout - the more you can recruit and get things done! Your Subpage is your place to shine!  Please login with an LFID to create a subpage!
