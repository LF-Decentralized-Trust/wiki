# Hyperledger : 2019 Q4 Identity WG

Created by Vipin Bharathan, last modified by Angelo de Caro on Dec 05, 2019

# Working Group

Identity

# Working Group Health

The working group health has been good. Regular attendance has stayed the same. Conference season (IIW, RWOT, SibOS, Maintainers Summit etc.) has decreased some of the activity; however we have some new blood that has come into the group. "Convergence" is a natural for this group as all running DLTs need multiple notions of Identity. The white paper needs to be moved into a stricter version control system like github; we have requested for a IDWG repo. The [Identity WG Implementers](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/IWG/Identity+WG+Implementers+Call) call is now in full swing. Implementation related roadmaps, standards etc. are regularly discussed.

# Issues

Gender diversity.

# Questions/Issues for the TSC

We await further findings from the Working Group task force.

# Overall Activity in the Past Quarter

Regular meetings are being held. Some examples of presentations given in Identity WG in the last quarter include:

- [Verifiable Credentials Authentication with OpenID Connect](https://github.com/bcgov/vc-authn-oidc)
- Bridges to SISIG
- Sybil Protection in Hyperledger DLTs
- Libra Identity Model
- A report on the activities of DID WG in W3C

There are a slew of new comments on the Identity Working group paper that indicate participation by people who are not regularly on the call. 

Implementers call has regular reports, architectural reviews and code reviews from:

- Hyperledger Indy
- Hyperledger Aries
- Hyperledger Ursa
- Sovrin
- W3C Standards
- Interop and External updates

Along with the Identity WG Implementers calls, we have become a standing or permanent conference on Identity; going all year around; the material we produce can be consumed asynchronously by people interested in digital Identity on DLTs. This is a mix of demos, works in progress, techniques, tips, commentary on regulatory activity etc.   

# Planned Work Products

Talk by Kim Cameron. Draft version of the Identity WG paper. Continue collaboration with other groups including healthcare SIG for patient consent. Get our resources into github to track contributions and to tighten down the Identity WG paper.

# Participant Diversity

There is a lack of gender diversity. We have plans to implement some chaoss related metrics to measure diversity.
