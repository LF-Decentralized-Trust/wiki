Created by David Boswell, last modified by Tomaz Sedej on Mar 31, 2022

This section tracks groups that are not currently active.  If anyone is interested in restarting activities and discussions in these groups, please feel free to do so.  You can click through the link below to find out more about what the group had been doing and you can also find a link to the group's mailing list.  Feel free to subscribe to the list and introduce yourself and post any thoughts, questions or suggestions you have about the group.  If there is interest in reactivating the group, we can relaunch it if there is interest from group members in doing that.

Those efforts could be built upon existing Hyperledger code bases, but are not limited to that. To get started, we need to talk openly and frankly about what can be done, and how to move forward in a thoughtful and coherent manner that strives to promote best practices and works to avoid missed opportunities.Moved to inactive status in February 2022[Supply Chain SIG](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/SCSIG/Supply+Chain+SIG)Hyperledger Supply Chain Special Interest Group (ST-SIG) represents a global membership of Logistics and Supply Chain professionals united in advancing the state of the supply chain industry through the implementation of enterprise-grade technology solutions utilizing the Hyperledger greenhouse of business blockchain frameworks and tools.Moved to inactive status in March 2022[Trade Finance SIG](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/TFSIG/Trade+Finance+SIG)The Hyperledger Trade Finance Special Interest Group (TF-SIG) is focused on applying distributed ledger technology (blockchain) in general, and Hyperledger technologies in particular, to trade and trade finance uses and needs. Moved to inactive status in March 2022
