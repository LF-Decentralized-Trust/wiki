# Hyperledger : Showing Your Support

Created by David Huseby, last modified by Tracy Kuhrt on Jan 05, 2022

Many of our community members wish to show their support for Hyperledger Foundation by identifying themselves as members of the community in their profiles on social media and their email signatures and even business cards. This page identifies the different roles in our community and provides guidelines on how to accurately represent yourself in your communications. In general, the rule is to be as specific as possible so that you don't confuse people about your role.

## Community Roles

### Everybody!!

First of all, everybody involved in the Hyperledger community is a supporter of the Hyperledger community and should proudly identify themselves as a **Hyperledger Supporter** or **Hyperledger Community Member**. We really mean everybody. Even if you're only just a fan of what we are doing at Hyperledger, you are a Hyperledger Supporter. Showing your support that way is an easy way for all of us to build up the Hyperledger Foundation and help ensure its future.

### Hyperledger Champion

Are you someone who attends meetups and other community events and gives presentations on Hyperledger technology and/or helps others get going with the tech? Do you write blog posts or create videos about Hyperledger tools? Are you helping people in your region learn about Hyperledger by taking part in a Hyperledger Chapter or by translating material into other languages? Consider showing your support by identifying yourself as a **Hyperledger Champion**. A champion is someone who goes over and above simple participation to spread the knowledge and reach new people and new markets with Hyperledger technology.

### **Hyperledger Project/Labs Maintainers and Contributors**

The people involved in our various open source software projects should identify themselves using the name of the project and their role in the project. All of the following are examples of what is acceptable:

- **Hyperledger Fabric Maintainer**
- **Hyperledger Ursa Developer**
- **Umbra, a Hyperledger Lab Contributor**

### Hyperledger Special Interest Group/Working Group Chair, Vice Chair, and Members

Members of Hyperledger special interest groups (SIGs) and working groups (WGs) may identify themselves using the name of the SIG/WG along with their role. As with the technical steering committee titles above, it is OK to abbreviate special interest groups and working groups as SIG and WG respectively. All of the following are examples of what is acceptable:

- **Hyperledger Capital Markets Special Interest Group Member**
- **Hyperledger Identity WG Chair**

### **Hyperledger Mentees and Mentors**

Each year we have a group of students that contribute as mentees and community members that contribute as mentors on our various mentorship programs. They should identify themselves using the year and role. Optionally, the name of the project may be included. All of the following are examples of what is acceptable:

- **Hyperledger 2021 Mentee**
- **Hyperledger 2020 Mentor, Git Commit Signing with DIDs**
  

### Hyperledger TSC Chair, Vice Chair, and Members

This group consists of the elected members of the [Hyperledger Technical Steering Committee.](https://www.hyperledger.org/about/leadership#tsc) There is one Chair and Vice Chair elected from the committee membership. When identifying yourself, please use "Technical Steering Committee" and your role. Abbreviating "Technical Steering Committee" as "TSC" is acceptable. All of the following are examples of what is acceptable:

- **Hyperledger Technical Steering Committee Chair**
- **Hyperledger Technical Steering Committee Vice Chair**
- **Hyperledger Technical Steering Committee Member**
- **Hyperledger TSC Member**

### Hyperledger Foundation Governing Board Members

This group consists of [Hyperledger Foundation Members](https://www.hyperledger.org/about/members), including Premier, General and Associate Members. Please identify yourself as a Hyperledger Foundation Member. Member logos are available for use by all Hyperledger Foundation members. Please send an email to [membership@hyperledger.org](mailto:membership@hyperledger.org) to get access to member logos. [See other member benefits](https://www.hyperledger.org/about/join).

### Hyperledger Foundation Staff

All of the paid staff working for the Linux Foundation and Hyperledger Foundation should identify themselves using their name and title followed by **Hyperledger Foundation, Linux Foundation** or just **Hyperledger Foundation Staff.**

## Conclusion

As stated in the introduction, the goal is for all of us to clearly communicate our roles in the community so that everybody can gain from their affiliation with Hyperledger Foundation in an honest and open way.
