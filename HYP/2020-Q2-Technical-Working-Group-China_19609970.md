Created by david liu, last modified by Gari Singh on Aug 13, 2020

# Working Group

This report covers Technical Working Group China

# Working Group Health

We are now struggling to call for new active volunteers. Most of past active volunteers retired. 

# Questions/Issues for the TSC

- Chinese Crypto Standards problem keeps on hinder usage of Hyperledger project in mainland China. Any suggestion?
- Meanwhile, Chinese local growing blockchain technologies triangle developers' focus in consortium blockchain industry.

# Overall Activity in the Past Quarter

- Translation for Fabric 2.x is under progress.
- By the end of Q2, we organize a 'Fabric GM Crypto fork open governance team' 
  
  A translation of proposal is here

  The Hyperledger Fabric code project has a very wide range of adoptions in many domestic industries and institutions, and has a very basic role in the application of the blockchain industry.
  
  According to China's policy requirements, it is necessary to support the national secret (GM) encryption algorithm. Many domestic enterprises and Fabric enthusiasts have successively carried out some corresponding national secret (GM) transformation work, with outstanding achievements. However, in this matter, there is serious duplication of labor, and human resources are also greatly wasted.
  
  Here, the Hyperledger China Technical Working Group (TWGC) proposes that the majority of Fabric enthusiasts and users gather and work together to create a standard national cryptographic project of Hyperledger Fabric, which is shared by everyone, and finally meet the needs of community maintainer request, merge into the Fabric up-stream.

# Planned Work Products

Translations. Community project incubation, Meetup  
Chinese Crypto Standards configurable for Hyperledger Fabric 

# Participant Diversity

Same as before, but a trend is most of Blockchain startups could not survive to keep participating in communities.
