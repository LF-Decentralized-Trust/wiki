# Hyperledger : Funding Opportunities for Projects

Created by David Boswell on Jun 17, 2024

The Hyperledger Foundation does not provide funding for projects, but we do want to help maintainers identify funding opportunities that may support their efforts. This page contains links to potential funding opportunities that are relevant to projects in the Hyperledger community.  If you know of other relevant opportunities to add, please leave a comment on this page. Hyperledger is not directly involved in or responsible for any of these programs.

- [Gitcoin Grants](https://grants.gitcoin.co/) – Gitcoin is focusing further on supporting Open Source Software, supporting both early stage and more mature builders across the Ethereum ecosystem.
- [GitHub Accelerator](https://accelerator.github.com/) - The future of open source depends on critical funding and curriculum to build durable and sustainable projects, GitHub Accelerator aims to propel new careers and companies for today and tomorrow by providing funding, mentorship, and support to help builders focus on their projects and take it to the next level.
  
- [GitHub Fund](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSds7V3j0GcAGtC5ThW15jB8wFGZNE1_o0YzuACl1XP1rXnGmQ/viewform) - Our investments will create new paths to grow open source companies and careers, and accelerate paradigm shifting technologies. We expect to invest somewhere between 8-10 innovative startups, on pace with last year, with a focus on AI, security, infrastructure, and DevOps. We are excited by the trends we are seeing with Generative AI, LLM, AI-powered developer tools, and security.
- [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors) - Sponsor the open source software your team has built its business on. Fund the projects that make up your software supply chain to improve its performance, reliability, and stability.
- [Hedera Grants and Accelerators](https://hedera.com/ecosystem/grants-accelerators) – The Hedera ecosystem offers supportive grant programs and accelerators.
- [Interledger Foundation Grants](https://interledger.org/financial-services) – Interledger provides grant opportunities to help organizations join Interledger, the global payments network for inclusive digital financial service providers.
- [Project Catalyst](https://projectcatalyst.io/) – At the start of each funding round, the Cardano community proposes ideas that solve challenges within the blockchain ecosystem and the wider world. The community then evaluates and votes on which technical, business, creative, and community projects will receive funding.
- [Stellar Grants and Funding](https://stellar.org/grants-and-funding) – The Stellar Development Foundation offers grants and funding to projects building on and contributing to the growth of both the Stellar network and Soroban, Stellar’s native smart contracts platform.
