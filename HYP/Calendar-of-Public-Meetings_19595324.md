Created by Tracy Kuhrt, last modified by David Boswell on Oct 10, 2024

**The calendar on this wiki page is not currently working.  You can find the calendars for the project or groups you are looking for by looking at the[individual calendar attached to the mailing list for that project or group](https://lists.lfdecentralizedtrust.org/groups) or by looking on the [LF Decentralized Trust public calendar](https://zoom-lfx.platform.linuxfoundation.org/meetings/lf-decentralized-trust?view=week).  Note that not all of the existing community calls from the Hyperledger community have been moved over to the LFDT calendar yet.**
