# Hyperledger : Sample Email Invitation

Created by Karen Ottoni, last modified by Daniela Barbosa on Aug 16, 2019

Sample, to be used during Proposal process to gather interested parties

\------------

Hi {{first\_name}},  
   
\----Personal intro-----  
   
I wanted to give you a heads up that we are currently gathering interested parties to be founding contributors to launch a Capital Markets Special Interest Group. The Hyperledger Capital Markets Special Interest Group (CM-SIG) will be focused on applying distributed ledger technology in general, and Hyperledger technologies in particular, to capital markets uses and needs.   
   
You can view the Capital Markets SIG draft proposal here: [Capital Markets SIG Proposal](Capital-Markets-SIG-Proposal_19595277.html). Feel free to suggest changes or add your name to the interested parties section (click 'edit' at the top  of the page to add, or you can also just reply to me and I can add you either publicly or privately for now). If you would like to make edits, please set up your LFID/Username, if you haven't already done so, to make edits in the wiki. It's simple, easy, and quick and there are [instructions here](https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/tools/Setting+up+an+LFID).  
   
Once again, we look forward to your participation in the Capital Markets Special Interest Group. Please feel free to share this information with others in your company or peers in the industry that you think would also be interested in participating, Hyperledger SIGs are always open to anyone to participate so they do not need to be a [Hyperledger member](https://www.hyperledger.org/members).  
   
regards,
