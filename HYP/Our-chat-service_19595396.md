# Hyperledger : Our chat service

Created by Ry Jones, last modified by David Boswell on Oct 10, 2023

Hyperledger has transitioned from [Rocket Chat](https://github.com/hyperledger-archives/rocket-chat-export) to [Discord](https://discord.gg/hyperledger). To join Hyperledger's Discord, you'll need to do a few things:

First, [please install and use a client](https://discord.com/download). Using Discord in the browser is the #1 cause of help desk requests.

Second, you will need to [join the Discord server](https://discord.gg/hyperledger).

Discord groups channels by category, and each project has a distinct one. Once you're in the server, here are links to specific projects:
