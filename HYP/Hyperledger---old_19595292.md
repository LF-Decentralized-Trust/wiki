# Graduated Projects

TitleProjectDescription[Besu](/wiki/spaces/BESU/overview)

[Besu](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/display/BESU/Hyperledger+Besu) is an Ethereum client designed to be enterprise-friendly for both public and private permissioned network use cases, with an extractable EVM implementation. It can also be run on test networks such as Holesky and Sepolia. Besu includes several consensus algorithms including Proof of Stake and Proof of Authority (IBFT 2.0, QBFT, and Clique). Its comprehensive plugin scheme is designed for modularity.

[Hyperledger Aries](/wiki/spaces/ARIES/overview)

Hyperledger Aries is your complete toolkit for decentralized identity solutions and digital trust. Issue, store and present verifiable credentials with maximum privacy preservation, and establish confidential, ongoing communication channels for rich interactions. It supports multiple protocols, credential types, ledgers and registries. It has frameworks in multiple development languages, and interoperability tools and profiles to help everything work together seamlessly.[Hyperledger Fabric](/wiki/spaces/fabric/overview)

Hyperledger Fabric is intended as a foundation for developing applications or solutions with a modular architecture. Hyperledger Fabric allows components, such as consensus and membership services, to be plug-and-play. Its modular and versatile design satisfies a broad range of industry use cases. It offers a unique approach to consensus that enables performance at scale while preserving privacy.[Hyperledger Indy](/wiki/spaces/indy/overview)

Hyperledger Indy provides tools, libraries, and reusable components for providing digital identities rooted on blockchains or other distributed ledgers so that they are interoperable across administrative domains, applications, and any other silo. Indy is interoperable with other blockchains or can be used standalone powering the decentralization of identity.

[Hyperledger Iroha](/wiki/spaces/iroha/overview)

Hyperledger Iroha is designed to be simple and easy to incorporate into infrastructural or IoT projects requiring distributed ledger technology. Hyperledger Iroha features a simple construction, modular, domain-driven C++ design, emphasis on client application development and a new, crash fault tolerant consensus algorithm, called YAC.

# Incubating Projects

TitleProjectDescription[Hyperledger AnonCreds](/wiki/spaces/ANONCREDS/overview)

AnonCreds (anonymous credentials) are a type of verifiable credential that supports important privacy-preserving capabilities through the use of zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) cryptography. Within the Hyperledger AnonCreds project is a specification for AnonCreds, documentation, implementations and tests.[Hyperledger Bevel Home](/wiki/spaces/BEV/overview)

Hyperledger Bevel is an accelerator by which developers can consistently deploy production-ready distributed networks across public and private cloud providers.[Hyperledger Cacti Home](/wiki/spaces/cactus/overview)

Hyperledger Cacti is a plugin-based framework which aims to provide developers with an abstraction over protocol specific implementations and enabling interoperability.  

This enables solutions to adapt to new protocols and make transactions involving multiple public and/or permissioned ledgers more easily. 

[Hyperledger Caliper](/wiki/spaces/caliper/overview)

Blockchain benchmark framework which allows users to measure the performance of a specific blockchain implementation with a set of predefined use cases.[Hyperledger Cello](/wiki/spaces/cello/overview)

Blockchain operating system[Hyperledger FireFly Home](/wiki/spaces/FIR/overview)

Hyperledger FireFly is the first open source Supernode: a complete stack for enterprises to build and scale secure Web3 applications. The FireFly API for digital assets, data flows, and blockchain transactions makes it radically faster to build production-ready apps on popular chains and protocols.[Hyperledger Solang](/wiki/spaces/SOL/overview)

Solang is a portable compiler for the Solidity language that targets Solana and Substrate (Polkadot). It is written in Rust, and leverages the LLVM infrastructure for the compiler backend.

# **Special Interest Groups**

* * *

NameDescription[Financial Markets SIG](/wiki/spaces/CMSIG/overview)

The Financial Markets Special Interest Group (FMSIG) represents industry professionals working together to study how Hyperledger DLTs interact with Financial Markets use cases. These use cases cover issuance and trading of traditional and digital instruments to continued market-making, liquidity, short-term funding management of risk, program-trading, regulations, capital requirements, traceability, post trade settlement, custody including corporate actions and more. This group also explores architecture, standards, regulations, identity and performance related considerations specific to Financial Markets and DLTs.

[Healthcare SIG](/wiki/spaces/HCSIG/overview)The Healthcare SIG represents healthcare professionals and technologists, and globally unites in advancing the state of the healthcare industry through the implementation of technology solutions using blockchain technologies in general, and the umbrella of Hyperledger frameworks and toolsets in specific.  
[Identity Special Interest Group](/wiki/spaces/IWG/overview)The purpose of the Identity Special Interest Group is to discuss, research, and document ways to capture, store, transmit and use Identities on the DLT, specifically for the projects in the Hyperledger greenhouse. The Identities can be of nodes that participate in the running of the DLT or entities that transact on the DLT.[Media and Entertainment SIG](/wiki/spaces/MESIG/overview)

The Media and Entertainment Special Interest Group (MESIG) brings together technical, academic, and industry-related expertise in an effort to exploit new blockchain and DLT technologies with a view to solving long-standing problems in the creation, fair distribution, and legally appropriate attribution of media assets.

[Public Sector SIG](/wiki/spaces/PSSIG/overview)Hyperledger Public Sector Special Interest Group (public-sector-SIG) is a Special Interest group focused on applying distributed ledger technology in general, and Hyperledger technologies in particular, to the public sector (e.g., government and government-related) uses and needs.[Telecom SIG](/wiki/spaces/TCSIG/overview)

The Hyperledger Telecom Special Interest Group is focused on technical and business-level conversations about appropriate use cases for blockchain technology in the Telecom industry.
