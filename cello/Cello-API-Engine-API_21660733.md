# Hyperledger Cello : Cello API-Engine API

Created by Yuanmao Zhu, last modified on Jun 18, 2022

This spec describes the API that the API Agents should provide. A Cello API-Engine should be responsible for the node management by interacting with the resource manager like Docker or Kubernetes.

# 1​.  Rules to follow

- All APIs by default start with a prefix of /api/v1/, e.g., to get the information of a specific network, you can use  GET network/&lt;network-uuid&gt;.
- The POST request is a JSON structure, like the following: { key: value, }
- The response is a JSON structure, like the following:
  
  ```
  {
	status: ‘successful’ or ‘fail’
	data: {} // useful data for the requestor
	msg: ‘’ // additional messages when there’s error
}
  ```
