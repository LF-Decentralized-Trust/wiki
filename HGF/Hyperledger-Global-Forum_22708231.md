**Hyperledger Global Forum** - September 12-14 Dublin, Ireland

Hyperledger Global Forum is the biggest annual gathering of the global Hyperledger community. It is a unique opportunity for contributors, members, service providers and enterprise end users from around the world to meet, align, plan and hack together in person. The event is open to any and all who are involved or interested in using, developing or learning more about Hyperledger’s open source enterprise blockchain technologies. Attendees will hear directly from those who are actively developing and deploying Hyperledger technologies as well as technology and business leaders who are shaping the future of enterprise blockchain. They will also have the chance to talk directly with Hyperledger project maintainers and the Technical Steering Committee, collaborate with other organizations on ideas that will directly impact the future of Hyperledger Foundation, and promote their work among the communities.

The agenda will comprise both a technical and enterprise track covering a comprehensive mix of blockchain and blockchain-related technologies, the latest plans for Hyperledger projects, cross-industry keynotes and panels on production deployments as well as networking opportunities for the community to bond, and knowledge sharing activities with mentors to help bring developers up the learning curve.
